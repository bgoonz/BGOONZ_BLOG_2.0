# Function.prototype.bind()

The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

## Syntax

    bind(thisArg)
    bind(thisArg, arg1)
    bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2)
    bind(thisArg, arg1, ... , argN)

### Parameters

`thisArg`
The value to be passed as the `this` parameter to the target function `func` when the bound function is called. The value is ignored if the bound function is constructed using the [`new`](../../operators/new) operator. When using `bind` to create a function (supplied as a callback) inside a `setTimeout`, any primitive value passed as `thisArg` is converted to object. If no arguments are provided to `bind `, or if the `thisArg` is `null` or `undefined`, the `this` of the executing scope is treated as the `thisArg` for the new function.

`arg1, arg2, ...argN` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>
Arguments to prepend to arguments provided to the bound function when invoking `func`.

### Return value

A copy of the given function with the specified `this` value, and initial arguments (if provided).

## Description

The `bind()` function creates a new **bound function**, which is an _exotic function object_ (a term from ECMAScript 2015) that wraps the original function object. Calling the bound function generally results in the execution of its wrapped function.

A bound function has the following internal properties:

`[[BoundTargetFunction]]`
The wrapped function object

`[[BoundThis]]`
The value that is always passed as `this` value when calling the wrapped function.

`[[BoundArguments]]`
A list of values whose elements are used as the first arguments to any call to the wrapped function.

`[[Call]]`
Executes code associated with this object. Invoked via a function call expression. The arguments to the internal method are a `this` value and a list containing the arguments passed to the function by a call expression.

When a bound function is called, it calls internal method `[[Call]]` on `[[BoundTargetFunction]]`, with following arguments `Call(boundThis, ...args)`. Where `boundThis` is `[[BoundThis]]`, `args` is `[[BoundArguments]]`, followed by the arguments passed by the function call.

A bound function may also be constructed using the [`new`](../../operators/new) operator. Doing so acts as though the target function had instead been constructed. The provided `this` value is ignored, while prepended arguments are provided to the emulated function.

## Examples

### Creating a bound function

The simplest use of `bind()` is to make a function that, no matter how it is called, is called with a particular `this` value.

A common mistake for new JavaScript programmers is to extract a method from an object, then to later call that function and expect it to use the original object as its `this` (e.g., by using the method in callback-based code).

Without special care, however, the original object is usually lost. Creating a bound function from the function, using the original object, neatly solves this problem:

    this.x = 9;    // 'this' refers to global 'window' object here in a browser
    const module = {
      x: 81,
      getX: function() { return this.x; }
    };

    module.getX();
    //  returns 81

    const retrieveX = module.getX;
    retrieveX();
    //  returns 9; the function gets invoked at the global scope

    //  Create a new function with 'this' bound to module
    //  New programmers might confuse the
    //  global variable 'x' with module's property 'x'
    const boundGetX = retrieveX.bind(module);
    boundGetX();
    //  returns 81

### Partially applied functions

The next simplest use of `bind()` is to make a function with pre-specified initial arguments.

These arguments (if any) follow the provided `this` value and are then inserted at the start of the arguments passed to the target function, followed by whatever arguments are passed bound function at the time it is called.

    function list() {
      return Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    }

    function addArguments(arg1, arg2) {
      return arg1 + arg2
    }

    const list1 = list(1, 2, 3);
    //  [1, 2, 3]

    const result1 = addArguments(1, 2);
    //  3

    // Create a function with a preset leading argument
    const leadingThirtysevenList = list.bind(null, 37);

    // Create a function with a preset first argument.
    const addThirtySeven = addArguments.bind(null, 37);

    const list2 = leadingThirtysevenList();
    //  [37]

    const list3 = leadingThirtysevenList(1, 2, 3);
    //  [37, 1, 2, 3]

    const result2 = addThirtySeven(5);
    //  37 + 5 = 42

    const result3 = addThirtySeven(5, 10);
    //  37 + 5 = 42
    //  (the second argument is ignored)

### With `setTimeout()`

By default within [`window.setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout), the `this` keyword will be set to the [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) (or `global`) object. When working with class methods that require `this` to refer to class instances, you may explicitly bind `this` to the callback function, in order to maintain the instance.

    function LateBloomer() {
      this.petalCount = Math.floor(Math.random() * 12) + 1;
    }

    // Declare bloom after a delay of 1 second
    LateBloomer.prototype.bloom = function() {
      window.setTimeout(this.declare.bind(this), 1000);
    };

    LateBloomer.prototype.declare = function() {
      console.log(`I am a beautiful flower with ${this.petalCount} petals!`);
    };

    const flower = new LateBloomer();
    flower.bloom();
    //  after 1 second, calls 'flower.declare()'

### Bound functions used as constructors

**Warning:** This section demonstrates JavaScript capabilities and documents some edge cases of the `bind()` method.

The methods shown below are not the best way to do things, and probably should not be used in any production environment.

Bound functions are automatically suitable for use with the [`new`](../../operators/new) operator to construct new instances created by the target function. When a bound function is used to construct a value, the provided `this` is ignored.

However, provided arguments are still prepended to the constructor call:

    function Point(x, y) {
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
    }

    Point.prototype.toString = function() {
      return `${this.x},${this.y}`;
    };

    const p = new Point(1, 2);
    p.toString();
    // '1,2'

    //  not supported in the polyfill below,

    //  works fine with native bind:

    const YAxisPoint = Point.bind(null, 0/*x*/);

    const emptyObj = {};
    const YAxisPoint = Point.bind(emptyObj, 0/*x*/);

    const axisPoint = new YAxisPoint(5);
    axisPoint.toString();                    // '0,5'

    axisPoint instanceof Point;              // true
    axisPoint instanceof YAxisPoint;         // true
    new YAxisPoint(17, 42) instanceof Point; // true

Note that you need not do anything special to create a bound function for use with [`new`](../../operators/new).

The corollary is that you need not do anything special to create a bound function to be called plainly, even if you would rather require the bound function to only be called using [`new`](../../operators/new).

    //  Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console
    //  ...continued from above

    //  Can still be called as a normal function
    //  (although usually this is undesired)
    YAxisPoint(13);

    `${emptyObj.x},${emptyObj.y}`;
    // >  '0,13'

If you wish to support the use of a bound function only using [`new`](../../operators/new), or only by calling it, the target function must enforce that restriction.

### Creating shortcuts

`bind()` is also helpful in cases where you want to create a shortcut to a function which requires a specific `this` value.

Take [`Array.prototype.slice()`](../array/slice), for example, which you want to use for converting an array-like object to a real array. You could create a shortcut like this:

    const slice = Array.prototype.slice;

    // ...

    slice.apply(arguments);

With `bind()`, this can be simplified.

In the following piece of code, `slice()` is a bound function to the [`apply()`](apply) function of [`Function`](../function), with the `this` value set to the [`slice()`](../array/slice) function of <span class="page-not-created">`Array.prototype`</span>. This means that additional `apply()` calls can be eliminated:

    //  same as "slice" in the previous example
    const unboundSlice = Array.prototype.slice;
    const slice = Function.prototype.apply.bind(unboundSlice);

    // ...

    slice(arguments);

## Polyfill

Because older browsers are generally also slower browsers, it is far more critical than most people recognize to create performance polyfills to make the browsing experience in outdated browsers slightly less horrible.

Thus, presented below are two options for `Function.prototype.bind()` polyfills:

1.  The first one is much smaller and more performant, but does not work when using the `new` operator.
2.  The second one is bigger and less performant, but it permits some usage of the `new` operator on bound functions.

Generally, in most code it's very rare to see `new` used on a bound function, so it is generally best to go with the first option.

    //  Does not work with `new (funcA.bind(thisArg, args))`
    if (!Function.prototype.bind) (function(){
      var slice = Array.prototype.slice;
      Function.prototype.bind = function() {
        var thatFunc = this, thatArg = arguments[0];
        var args = slice.call(arguments, 1);
        if (typeof thatFunc !== 'function') {
          // closest thing possible to the ECMAScript 5
          // internal IsCallable function
          throw new TypeError('Function.prototype.bind - ' +
                 'what is trying to be bound is not callable');
        }
        return function(){
          var funcArgs = args.concat(slice.call(arguments))
          return thatFunc.apply(thatArg, funcArgs);
        };
      };
    })();

You can partially work around this by inserting the following code at the beginning of your scripts, allowing use of much of the functionality of `bind()` in implementations that do not natively support it.

    //  Yes, it does work with `new (funcA.bind(thisArg, args))`
    if (!Function.prototype.bind) (function(){
      var ArrayPrototypeSlice = Array.prototype.slice;
      Function.prototype.bind = function(otherThis) {
        if (typeof this !== 'function') {
          // closest thing possible to the ECMAScript 5
          // internal IsCallable function
          throw new TypeError('Function.prototype.bind - what is trying to be bound is not callable');
        }

        var baseArgs= ArrayPrototypeSlice.call(arguments, 1),
            baseArgsLength = baseArgs.length,
            fToBind = this,
            fNOP    = function() {},
            fBound  = function() {
              baseArgs.length = baseArgsLength; // reset to default base arguments
              baseArgs.push.apply(baseArgs, arguments);
              return fToBind.apply(
                     fNOP.prototype.isPrototypeOf(this) ? this : otherThis, baseArgs
              );
            };

        if (this.prototype) {
          // Function.prototype doesn't have a prototype property
          fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;
        }
        fBound.prototype = new fNOP();

        return fBound;
      };
    })();

Some of the many differences (there may well be others, as this list does not seriously attempt to be exhaustive) between this algorithm and the specified algorithm are:

- The partial implementation relies on [`Array.prototype.slice()`](../array/slice), [`Array.prototype.concat()`](../array/concat), [`Function.prototype.call()`](call) and [`Function.prototype.apply()`](apply), built-in methods to have their original values.
- The partial implementation creates functions that do not have immutable "poison pill" [`caller`](caller) and `arguments` properties that throw a [`TypeError`](../typeerror) upon get, set, or deletion. (This could be added if the implementation supports [`Object.defineProperty`](../object/defineproperty), or partially implemented \[without throw-on-delete behavior\] if the implementation supports the [`__defineGetter__`](../object/__definegetter__) and [`__defineSetter__`](../object/__definesetter__) extensions.)
- The partial implementation creates functions that have a `prototype` property. (Proper bound functions have none.)
- The partial implementation creates bound functions whose [`length`](length) property does not agree with that mandated by ECMA-262: it creates functions with `length` of `0`. A full implementation—depending on the length of the target function and the number of pre-specified arguments—may return a non-zero length.
- The partial implementation creates bound functions whose [`name`](name) property is not derived from the original function name. According to ECMA-262, name of the returned bound function should be "bound " + name of target function (note the space character).

If you choose to use this partial implementation, **you must not rely on those cases where behavior deviates from ECMA-262, 5<sup>th</sup> edition!** Thankfully, these deviations from the specification rarely (if ever) come up in most coding situations. If you do not understand any of the deviations from the specification above, then it is safe in this particular case to not worry about these noncompliant deviation details.

**If it's absolutely necessary and performance is not a concern**, a far slower (but more specification-compliant solution) can be found at <https://github.com/Raynos/function-bind>.
