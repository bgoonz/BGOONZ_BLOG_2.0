# await

The `await` operator is used to wait for a [`Promise`](../global_objects/promise). It can only be used inside an [`async function`](../statements/async_function) within regular JavaScript code; however it can be used on its own with [JavaScript modules.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

## Syntax

    [rv] = await expression;

`expression`  
A [`Promise`](../global_objects/promise) or any value to wait for.

`rv`  
Returns the fulfilled value of the promise, or the value itself if it's not a `Promise`.

## Description

The `await` expression causes `async` function execution to pause until a `Promise` is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected), and to resume execution of the `async` function after fulfillment. When resumed, the value of the `await` expression is that of the fulfilled `Promise`.

If the `Promise` is rejected, the `await` expression throws the rejected value.

If the value of the _expression_ following the `await` operator is not a `Promise`, it's converted to a [resolved Promise](../global_objects/promise/resolve).

An `await` splits execution flow, allowing the caller of the async function to resume execution. After the `await` defers the continuation of the async function, execution of subsequent statements ensues. If this `await` is the last expression executed by its function, execution continues by returning to the function's caller a pending `Promise` for completion of the `await`'s function and resuming execution of that caller.

## Examples

### Awaiting a promise to be fulfilled

If a `Promise` is passed to an `await` expression, it waits for the `Promise` to be fulfilled and returns the fulfilled value.

    function resolveAfter2Seconds(x) {
      return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve(x);
        }, 2000);
      });
    }

    async function f1() {
      var x = await resolveAfter2Seconds(10);
      console.log(x); // 10
    }

    f1();

### Thenable objects

[`Thenable objects`](../global_objects/promise/then) will be fulfilled just the same.

    async function f2() {
      const thenable = {
        then: function(resolve, _reject) {
          resolve('resolved!')
        }
      };
      console.log(await thenable); // resolved!
    }

    f2();

### Conversion to promise

If the value is not a `Promise`, it converts the value to a resolved `Promise`, and waits for it.

    async function f3() {
      var y = await 20;
      console.log(y); // 20
    }

    f3();

### Promise rejection

If the `Promise` is rejected, the rejected value is thrown.

    async function f4() {
      try {
        var z = await Promise.reject(30);
      } catch(e) {
        console.error(e); // 30
      }
    }

    f4();

### Handling rejected promises

Handle rejected `Promise` without try block.

    var response = await promisedFunction().catch((err) => { console.error(err); });
    // response will be undefined if the promise is rejected

### Top level await

You can use the `await` keyword on its own (outside of an async function) within a [JavaScript module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules). This means modules, with child modules that use `await`, wait for the child module to execute before they themselves run. All while not blocking other child modules from loading.

Here is an example of a simple module using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and specifying await within the `export statement`. Any modules that include this will wait for the fetch to resolve before running any code.

    // fetch request
    const colors = fetch('../data/colors.json')
      .then(response => response.json());

    export default await colors;
