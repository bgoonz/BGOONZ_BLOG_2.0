### Here's a Cheatsheet:

### Getting Started (Advanced Users Skip Section):

---

#### ✔ Check the Current Directory ➡ `pwd`:

On the command line, it's important to know the directory we are currently working on. For that, we can use `pwd` command.

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dimzLUrmDI4Ufev6.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>It shows that I'm working on my Desktop directory.

#### ✔ Display List of Files ➡ `ls`:

To see the list of files and directories in the current directory use `ls` command in your CLI.

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HHzVrK2CtTPwTdYT.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Shows all of my files and directories of my Desktop directory.

-   <span id="20cb">To show the contents of a directory pass the directory name to the `ls` command i.e. `ls directory_name`.</span>
-   <span id="5cd8">Some useful `ls` command options:-</span>

OptionDescriptionls -alist all files including hidden file starting with '.'ls -llist with the long formatls -lalist long format including hidden files

#### ✔ Create a Directory ➡ `mkdir`:

We can create a new folder using the `mkdir` command. To use it type `mkdir folder_name`.

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*m3dDyC9vRJBUZSxR.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Use `ls` command to see the directory is created or not.

I created a cli-practice directory in my working directory i.e. Desktop directory.

#### ✔ Move Between Directories ➡ `cd`:

It's used to change directory or to move other directories. To use it type `cd directory_name`.

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*34KGxT2G8oNMDnIc.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Can use `pwd` command to confirm your directory name.

Changed my directory to the cli-practice directory. And the rest of the tutorial I'm gonna work within this directory.

#### ✔ Parent Directory ➡ `..`:

We have seen `cd` command to change directory but if we want to move back or want to move to the parent directory we can use a special symbol `..` after `cd` command, like `cd ..`

#### ✔ Create Files ➡ `touch`:

We can create an empty file by typing `touch file_name`. It's going to create a new file in the current directory (the directory you are currently in) with your provided name.

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*xu1wtv7gJ2NMvP60.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>I created a hello.txt file in my current working directory. Again you can use `ls` command to see the file is created or not.

Now open your hello.txt file in your text editor and write _Hello Everyone!_ into your hello.txt file and save it.

#### ✔ Display the Content of a File ➡ `cat`:

We can display the content of a file using the `cat` command. To use it type `cat file_name`.

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*iKf5w9QFNCeLRv8a.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Shows the content of my hello.txt file.

#### ✔ Move Files & Directories ➡ `mv`:

To move a file and directory, we use `mv` command.

By typing `mv file_to_move destination_directory`, you can move a file to the specified directory.

By entering `mv directory_to_move destination_directory`, you can move all the files and directories under that directory.

Before using this command, we are going to create two more directories and another txt file in our cli-practice directory.

`mkdir html css touch bye.txt`

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*piaAQz_MQpzo7DPH.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Yes, we can use multiple directories & files names one after another to create multiple directories & files in one command.

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5jmj_ZyNz46GuQKz.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Moved my bye.txt file into my css directory and then moved my css directory into my html directory.

#### ✔ Rename Files & Directories ➡ `mv`:

`mv` command can also be used to rename a file and a directory.

You can rename a file by typing `mv old_file_name new_file_name` & also rename a directory by typing `mv old_directory_name new_directory_name`.

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WTVu1dd6gr-nmWhD.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Renamed my hello.txt file to the hi.txt file and html directory to the folder directory.

#### ✔ Copy Files & Directories ➡ `cp`:

To do this, we use the `cp` command.

-   <span id="62fa">You can copy a file by entering `cp file_to_copy new_file_name`.</span>

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kCLVtKN9oKPbHfRF.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Copied my hi.txt file content into hello.txt file. For confirmation open your hello.txt file in your text editor.

-   <span id="9bfc">You can also copy a directory by adding the `-r` option, like `cp -r directory_to_copy new_directory_name`.</span>

_The_ `-r` _option for "recursive" means that it will copy all of the files including the files inside of subfolders._

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MnmzMiioIYCuK92B.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Here I copied all of the files from the folder to folder-copy.

#### ✔ Remove Files & Directories ➡ `rm`:

To do this, we use the `rm` command.

-   <span id="487a">To remove a file, you can use the command like `rm file_to_remove`.</span>

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ohCmdthd92_HA6Ze.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>Here I removed my hi.txt file.

-   <span id="0e9a">To remove a directory, use the command like `rm -r directory_to_remove`.</span>

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*voDbzwSpw24A2RjQ.gif" class="graf-image" />
</figure>I removed my folder-copy directory from my cli-practice directory i.e. current working directory.

#### ✔ Clear Screen ➡ `clear`:

Clear command is used to clear the terminal screen.

#### ✔ Home Directory ➡ `~`:

The Home directory is represented by `~`. The Home directory refers to the base directory for the user. If we want to move to the Home directory we can use `cd ~` command. Or we can only use `cd` command.

### MY COMMANDS:

### 1.) Recursively unzip zip files and then delete the archives when finished:

**here is a** <a href="https://github.com/bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough/tree/master/steps/1-recursive-unzip" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">
<strong>folde</strong>
</a>**r containing the before and after… I had to change folder names slightly due to a limit on the length of file-paths in a github repo.**

    find . -name "*.zip" | while read filename; do unzip -o -d "`dirname "$filename"`" "$filename"; done;

    find . -name "*.zip" -type f -print -delete

---

### 2.) Install node modules recursively:

    npm i -g recursive-install

    npm-recursive-install

---

### 3.) Clean up unnecessary files/folders in git repo:

    find . -empty -type f -print -delete #Remove empty files

    # -------------------------------------------------------
    find . -empty -type d -print -delete #Remove empty folders

    # -------------------------------------------------------

    # This will remove .git folders...    .gitmodule files as well as .gitattributes and .gitignore files.

    find . \( -name ".git" -o -name ".gitignore" -o -name ".gitmodules" -o -name ".gitattributes" \) -exec rm -rf -- {} +

    # -------------------------------------------------------

    # This will remove the filenames you see listed below that just take up space if a repo has been downloaded for use exclusively in your personal file system (in which case the following files just take up space)# Disclaimer... you should not use this command in a repo that you intend to use with your work as it removes files that attribute the work to their original creators!

    find . \( -name "*SECURITY.txt" -o -name "*RELEASE.txt" -o -name "*CHANGELOG.txt" -o -name "*LICENSE.txt" -o -name "*CONTRIBUTING.txt" -name "*HISTORY.md" -o -name "*LICENSE" -o -name "*SECURITY.md" -o -name "*RELEASE.md" -o -name "*CHANGELOG.md" -o -name "*LICENSE.md" -o -name "*CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" -o -name "\*CONTRIBUTING.md" \) -exec rm -rf -- {} +

    badFolder Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript

    When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey- the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I'll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.The post Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

    Looking fine with Firefox 89

    Firefox 89 has smartened up and brings with it a slimmed-down, slightly more minimalist interface.badFolder Along with this new look, we get some great styling features including a force-colours feature for media queries and better control over how fonts are displayed. The long-awaited top-level await keyword for JavaScript modules is now enabled, as well as the PerformanceEventTiming interface, which is another addition to the performance suite of APIs: 89 really has been working out!The post Looking fine with Firefox 89 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

### 7.) Execute command recursively:

**Here I have modified the command I wish to run recursively to account for the fact that the 'find' command already works recursively, by appending the -maxdepth 1 flag…**

> **I am essentially removing the recursive action of the find command…**

**That way, if the command affects the more deeply nested folders we know the outer RecurseDirs function we are using to run the _find/pandoc_ line once in every subfolder of the working directory… is working properly!**

# 20. Remove duplicate lines from a text file

### Description:

> Notes:
> //...syntax of uniq...//
> $uniq [OPTION] [INPUT[OUTPUT]]
> The syntax of this is quite easy to understand. Here, INPUT refers to the input file in which repeated lines need to be filtered out and if INPUT isn't specified then uniq reads from the standard input. OUTPUT refers to the output file in which you can store the filtered output generated by uniq command and as in case of INPUT if OUTPUT isn't specified then uniq writes to the standard output.

Now, let's understand the use of this with the help of an example. Suppose you have a text file named kt.txt which contains repeated lines that needs to be omitted. This can simply be done with uniq.

###### code:

```bash
sudo apt install uniq
uniq -u input.txt output.txt

```

---

# 21. Remove lines containing string:

### Description:

> Notes:

###### code:

# 26. Filter Corrupted Git Repo For Troublesome File:

### Description:

> Notes:

###### code:

```bash

git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch assets/_index.html' HEAD

```

---

# 27. OVERWRITE LOCAL CHANGES:

### Description:

Important: If you have any local changes, they will be lost. With or without --hard option, any local commits that haven't been pushed will be lost.[*]
If you have any files that are not tracked by Git (e.g. uploaded user content), these files will not be affected.

> Notes:
> First, run a fetch to update all origin/<branch> refs to latest:

###### code:

```bash

git fetch --all
# Backup your current branch:

git branch backup-master
# Then, you have two options:

git reset --hard origin/master
# OR If you are on some other branch:

git reset --hard origin/<branch_name>
# Explanation:
# git fetch downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.

# Then the git reset resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The --hard option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in origin/master
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master

```

---

# 28. Remove Submodules:

### Description: To remove a submodule you need to:

> Notes:

> Delete the relevant section from the .gitmodules file.
> Stage the .gitmodules changes git add .gitmodules

> Run git rm --cached path_to_submodule (no trailing slash).
> Run rm -rf .git/modules/path_to_submodule (no trailing slash).
> Commit git commit -m "Removed submodule "

# COMMAND-LINE PROCESSING CYCLE


# The default order for command lookup is functions, followed by built-ins, with scripts and executables last.
# There are three built-ins that you can use to override this order: `command`, `builtin` and `enable`.

command  # removes alias and function lookup. Only built-ins and commands found in the search path are executed
builtin  # looks up only built-in commands, ignoring functions and commands found in PATH
enable   # enables and disables shell built-ins

eval     # takes arguments and run them through the command-line processing steps all over again


# INPUT/OUTPUT REDIRECTORS


cmd1|cmd2  # pipe; takes standard output of cmd1 as standard input to cmd2
< file     # takes standard input from file
> file     # directs standard output to file
>> file    # directs standard output to file; append to file if it already exists
>|file     # forces standard output to file even if noclobber is set
n>|file    # forces output to file from file descriptor n even if noclobber is set
<> file    # uses file as both standard input and standard output
n<>file    # uses file as both input and output for file descriptor n
n>file     # directs file descriptor n to file
n<file     # takes file descriptor n from file
n>>file    # directs file description n to file; append to file if it already exists
n>&        # duplicates standard output to file descriptor n
n<&        # duplicates standard input from file descriptor n
n>&m       # file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the output file descriptor
n<&m       # file descriptor n is made to be a copy of the input file descriptor
&>file     # directs standard output and standard error to file
<&-      # closes the standard input
>&-      # closes the standard output
n>&-     # closes the ouput from file descriptor n
n<&-     # closes the input from file descripor n

|tee <file># output command to both terminal and a file (-a to append to file)


# PROCESS HANDLING


# To suspend a job, type CTRL+Z while it is running. You can also suspend a job with CTRL+Y.
# This is slightly different from CTRL+Z in that the process is only stopped when it attempts to read input from terminal.
# Of course, to interrupt a job, type CTRL+C.

myCommand &  # runs job in the background and prompts back the shell

jobs         # lists all jobs (use with -l to see associated PID)

fg           # brings a background job into the foreground
fg %+        # brings most recently invoked background job
fg %-      # brings second most recently invoked background job
fg %N        # brings job number N
fg %string   # brings job whose command begins with string
fg %?string  # brings job whose command contains string

kill -l               # returns a list of all signals on the system, by name and number
kill PID              # terminates process with specified PID
kill -s SIGKILL 4500  # sends a signal to force or terminate the process
kill -15 913          # Ending PID 913 process with signal 15 (TERM)
kill %1               # Where %1 is the number of job as read from 'jobs' command.

ps           # prints a line of information about the current running login shell and any processes running under it
ps -a        # selects all processes with a tty except session leaders

trap cmd sig1 sig2  # executes a command when a signal is received by the script
trap "" sig1 sig2   # ignores that signals
trap - sig1 sig2    # resets the action taken when the signal is received to the default

disown <PID|JID>    # removes the process from the list of jobs

wait                # waits until all background jobs have finished
sleep <number>      # wait # of seconds before continuing

pv                  # display progress bar for data handling commands. often used with pipe like |pv
yes                 # give yes response everytime an input is requested from script/process


# TIPS & TRICKS


# set an alias
cd; nano .bash_profile
> alias gentlenode='ssh admin@gentlenode.com -p 3404'  # add your alias in .bash_profile

# to quickly go to a specific directory
cd; nano .bashrc
> shopt -s cdable_vars
> export websites="/Users/mac/Documents/websites"

source .bashrc
cd $websites
