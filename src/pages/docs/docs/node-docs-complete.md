# How to use the Node.js REPL

description: "REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, and it's a great way to explore the Node.js features in a quick way"

---

The `node` command is the one we use to run our Node.js scripts:

```bash

node script.js

```

If we omit the filename, we use it in REPL mode:

```bash

node

```

> Note: REPL also known as Read Evaluate Print Loop is a programming language environment (basically a console window) that takes single expression as user input and returns the result back to the console after execution.

If you try it now in your terminal, this is what happens:

```bash

❯ node

>

```

the command stays in idle mode and waits for us to enter something.

> Tip: if you are unsure how to open your terminal, google "How to open terminal on \<your-operating-system\>".

The REPL is waiting for us to enter some JavaScript code, to be more precise.

Start simple and enter

```bash

> console.log('test')

test

undefined

>

```

The first value, `test`, is the output we told the console to print, then we get `undefined` which is the return value of running `console.log()`.

We can now enter a new line of JavaScript.

## Use the tab to autocomplete

The cool thing about the REPL is that it's interactive.

As you write your code, if you press the `tab` key the REPL will try to autocomplete what you wrote to match a variable you already defined or a predefined one.

## Exploring JavaScript objects

Try entering the name of a JavaScript class, like `Number`, add a dot and press `tab`.

The REPL will print all the properties and methods you can access on that class:

![Pressing tab reveals object properties](images/tab.png)

## Explore global objects

You can inspect the globals you have access to by typing `global.` and pressing `tab`:

![Globals](images/globals.png)

## The \_ special variable

If after some code you type `_`, that is going to print the result of the last operation.

## Dot commands

The REPL has some special commands, all starting with a dot `.`. They are

-   `.help`: shows the dot commands help
-
-   `.editor`: enables editor mode, to write multiline JavaScript code with ease. Once you are in this mode, enter ctrl-D to run the c
-
-   `.break`: when inputting a multi-line expression, entering the .break command
-
-   `.clear`: resets the REPL context to an empty object and clears any multi-line expression currently being input.

-   `.load`: loads a JavaScript file, relative to the current working directory

-   `.save`: saves all you entered in the REPL session to a file (specify the filename)

-   `.exit`: exits the repl (same as pressing ctrl-C two times)

The REPL knows when you are typing a multi-line statement without the need to invoke `.editor`.

For example if you start typing an iteration like this:

```js
//

[1, 2, 3].forEach(num => {

```

and you press `enter`, the REPL will go to a new line that starts with 3 dots, indicating you can now continue to work on that block.

```js
//

... console.log(num)

... })

```

If you type `.break` at the end of a line, the multiline mode will stop and the statement will not be executed.

# Node.js, accept arguments from the command line

description: 'How to accept arguments in a Node.js program passed from the command line'

You can pass any number of arguments when invoking a Node.js application using

```bash

node app.js

```

Arguments can be standalone or have a key and a value.

For example:

```bash

node app.js joe

```

or

```bash

node app.js name=joe

```

This changes how you will retrieve this value in the Node.js code.

The way you retrieve it is using the `process` object built into Node.js.

It exposes an `argv` property, which is an array that contains all the command line invocation arguments.

The first element is the full path of the `node` command.

The second element is the full path of the file being executed.

All the additional arguments are present from the third position going forward.

You can iterate over all the arguments (including the node path and the file path) using a loop:

```js
//
process.argv.forEach((val, index) => {
    console.log(`${index}: ${val}`);
});
```

You can get only the additional arguments by creating a new array that excludes the first 2 params:

```js
//
const args = process.argv.slice(2);
```

If you have one argument without an index name, like this:

```bash

node app.js joe

```

you can access it using

```js
//
const args = process.argv.slice(2);

args[0];
```

In this case:

```bash

node app.js name=joe

```

`args[0]` is `name=joe`, and you need to

parse it. The best way to do so is by using the [`minimist`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimist) library, which helps dealing with arguments:

```js
//
const args = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2));

args['name']; //joe
```

Install the required `minimist` package using `npm` (lesson about the package manager comes [later on](https://nodejs.dev/learn/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager)).

```bash

npm install minimist

```

This time you need to use double dashes before each argument name:

```bash

node app.js --name=joe

```

# Output to the command line using Node.js

description: 'How to print to the command line console using Node.js, from the basic console.log to more complex scenarios'

## Basic output using the console module

Node.js provides a [`console` module](https://nodejs.org/api/console.html) which provides tons of very useful ways to interact with the command line.

It is basically the same as the `console` object you find in the browser.

The most basic and most used method is `console.log()`, which prints the string you pass to it to the console.

If you pass an object, it will render it as a string.

You can pass multiple variables to `console.log`, for example:

```js
//
const x = 'x';

const y = 'y';

console.log(x, y);
```

and Node.js will print both.

We can also format pretty phrases by passing variables and a format specifier.

For example:

```js
//
console.log('My %s has %d years', 'cat', 2);
```

-   `%s` format a variable as a string
-
-   `%d` format a variable as a number
-
-   `%i` format a variable as its integer part only

-   `%o` format a variable as an object

Example:

```js
//
console.log('%o', Number);
```

## Clear the console

`console.clear()` clears the console (the behavior might depend on the console used)

## Counting elements

`console.count()` is a handy method.

Take this code:

<iframe title="Output to the command line using Node.js" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/nodejs-dev-0002-01?index.js&zenmode=1&view=editor" alt="nodejs-dev-0002-01 on StackBlitz" style="height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;">
</iframe>
<br>

<!--

```js
//

const x = 1

const y = 2

const z = 3

console.count(

  'The value of x is ' + x + ' and has been checked .. how many times?'

)

console.count(

  'The value of x is ' + x + ' and has been checked .. how many times?'

)

console.count(

  'The value of y is ' + y + ' and has been checked .. how many times?'

)

```

-->

What happens is that `console.count()` will count the number of times a string is printed, and print the count next to it:

You can just count apples and oranges:

```js
//
const oranges = ['orange', 'orange'];

const apples = ['just one apple'];

oranges.forEach((fruit) => {
    console.count(fruit);
});

apples.forEach((fruit) => {
    console.count(fruit);
});
```

## Reset counting

The console.countReset() method resets counter used with console.count().

We will use the apples and orange example to demonstrate this.

```js
//
const oranges = ['orange', 'orange'];

const apples = ['just one apple'];

oranges.forEach((fruit) => {
    console.count(fruit);
});

apples.forEach((fruit) => {
    console.count(fruit);
});

console.countReset('orange');

oranges.forEach((fruit) => {
    console.count(fruit);
});
```

Notice how the call to `console.countReset('orange')` resets the value counter to zero.

## Print the stack trace

There might be cases where it's useful to print the call stack trace of a function, maybe to answer the question _how did you reach that part of the code?_

You can do so using `console.trace()`:

```js
//
const function2 = () => console.trace();

const function1 = () => function2();

function1();
```

This will print the stack trace. This is what's printed if we try this in the Node.js REPL:

```bash

Trace

    at function2 (repl:1:33)

    at function1 (repl:1:25)

    at repl:1:1

    at ContextifyScript.Script.runInThisContext (vm.js:44:33)

    at REPLServer.defaultEval (repl.js:239:29)

    at bound (domain.js:301:14)

    at REPLServer.runBound [as eval] (domain.js:314:12)

    at REPLServer.onLine (repl.js:440:10)

    at emitOne (events.js:120:20)

    at REPLServer.emit (events.js:210:7)

```

## Calculate the time spent

You can easily calculate how much time a function takes to run, using `time()` and `timeEnd()`

```js
//
const doSomething = () => console.log('test');

const measureDoingSomething = () => {
    console.time('doSomething()');

    //do something, and measure the time it takes

    doSomething();

    console.timeEnd('doSomething()');
};

measureDoingSomething();
```

## stdout and stderr

As we saw console.log is great for printing messages in the Console. This is what's called the standard output, or `stdout`.

`console.error` prints to the `stderr` stream.

It will not appear in the console, but it will appear in the error log.

## Color the output

You can color the output of your text in the console by using [escape sequences](https://gist.github.com/iamnewton/8754917). An escape sequence is a set of characters that identifies a color.

Example:

```js
//
console.log('\x1b[33m%s\x1b[0m', 'hi!');
```

You can try that in the Node.js REPL, and it will print `hi!` in yellow.

However, this is the low-level way to do this. The simplest way to go about coloring the console output is by using a library. [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) is such a library, and in addition to coloring it also helps with other styling facilities, like making text bold, italic or underlined.

You install it with `npm install chalk`, then you can use it:

```js
//
const chalk = require('chalk');

console.log(chalk.yellow('hi!'));
```

Using `chalk.yellow` is much more convenient than trying to remember the escape codes, and the code is much more readable.

Check the project link posted above for more usage examples.

## Create a progress bar

[Progress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/progress) is an awesome package to create a progress bar in the console. Install it using `npm install progress`

This snippet creates a 10-step progress bar, and every 100ms one step is completed. When the bar completes we clear the interval:

```js
//
const ProgressBar = require('progress');

const bar = new ProgressBar(':bar', { total: 10 });

const timer = setInterval(() => {
    bar.tick();

    if (bar.complete) {
        clearInterval(timer);
    }
}, 100);
```

# Accept input from the command line in Node.js

description: 'How to make a Node.js CLI program interactive using the built-in readline Node.js module'

How to make a Node.js CLI program interactive?

Node.js since version 7 provides the [`readline` module](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) to perform exactly this: get input from a readable stream such as the `process.stdin` stream, which during the execution of a Node.js program is the terminal input, one line at a time.

```js
//
const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,

    output: process.stdout
});

readline.question(`What's your name?`, (name) => {
    console.log(`Hi ${name}!`);

    readline.close();
});
```

This piece of code asks the username, and once the text is entered and the user presses enter, we send a greeting.

The `question()` method shows the first parameter (a question) and waits for the user input. It calls the callback function once enter is pressed.

In this callback function, we close the readline interface.

`readline` offers several other methods, and I'll let you check them out on the package documentation linked above.

If you need to require a password, it's best not to echo it back, but instead show a `*` symbol.

The simplest way is to use the [`readline-sync` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync) which is very similar in terms of the API and handles this out of the box.

A more complete and abstract solution is provided by the [Inquirer.js package](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js).

You can install it using `npm install inquirer`, and then you can replicate the above code like this:

```js
//
const inquirer = require('inquirer');

var questions = [
    {
        type: 'input',

        name: 'name',

        message: "What's your name?"
    }
];

inquirer.prompt(questions).then((answers) => {
    console.log(`Hi ${answers['name']}!`);
});
```

Inquirer.js lets you do many things like asking multiple choices, having radio buttons, confirmations, and more.

It's worth knowing all the alternatives, especially the built-in ones provided by Node.js, but if you plan to take CLI input to the next level, Inquirer.js is an optimal choice.

# Expose functionality from a Node.js file using exports

description: 'How to use the module.exports API to expose data to other files in your application, or to other applications as well'

Node.js has a built-in module system.

A Node.js file can import functionality exposed by other Node.js files.

When you want to import something you use

```js
//
const library = require('./library');
```

to import the functionality exposed in the `library.js` file that resides in the current file folder.

In this file, functionality must be exposed before it can be imported by other files.

Any other object or variable defined in the file by default is private and not exposed to the outer world.

This is what the `module.exports` API offered by the [`module` system](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) allows us to do.

When you assign an object or a function as a new `exports` property, that is the thing that's being exposed, and as such, it can be imported in other parts of your app, or in other apps as well.

You can do so in 2 ways.

The first is to assign an object to `module.exports`, which is an object provided out of the box by the module system, and this will make your file export _just that object_:

```js
//
// car.js

const car = {
    brand: 'Ford',

    model: 'Fiesta'
};

module.exports = car;
```

```js
//
// index.js

const car = require('./car');
```

The second way is to add the exported object as a property of `exports`. This way allows you to export multiple objects, functions or data:

```js
//
const car = {
    brand: 'Ford',

    model: 'Fiesta'
};

exports.car = car;
```

or directly

```js
//
exports.car = {
    brand: 'Ford',

    model: 'Fiesta'
};
```

And in the other file, you'll use it by referencing a property of your import:

```js
//
const items = require('./items');

const car = items.car;
```

or

```js
//
const car = require('./items').car;
```

What's the difference between `module.exports` and `exports`?

The first exposes the object it points to.

The latter exposes _the properties_ of the object it points to.

# An introduction to the npm package manager

description: 'A quick guide to npm, the powerful package manager key to the success of Node.js. In January 2017 over 350000 packages were reported being listed in the npm registry, making it the biggest single language code repository on Earth, and you can be sure there is a package for (almost!) everything.'

## Introduction to npm

`npm` is the standard package manager for Node.js.

In January 2017 over 350000 packages were reported being listed in the npm registry, making it the biggest single language code repository on Earth, and you can be sure there is a package for (almost!) everything.

It started as a way to download and manage dependencies of Node.js packages, but it has since become a tool used also in frontend JavaScript.

There are many things that `npm` does.

> [**Yarn**](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.js.org/) are alternatives to npm cli. You can check them out as well.

## Downloads

`npm` manages downloads of dependencies of your project.

### Installing all dependencies

If a project has a `package.json` file, by running

```bash

npm install

```

it will install everything the project needs, in the `node_modules` folder, creating it if it's not existing already.

### Installing a single package

You can also install a specific package by running

```bash

npm install <package-name>

```

Furthermore, since npm 5, this command adds `<package-name>` to the `package.json` file _dependencies_. Before version 5, you needed to add the flag `--save`.

Often you'll see more flags added to this command:

-   `--save-dev` installs and adds the entry to the `package.json` file _devDependencies_
-
-   `--no-save` installs but does not add the entry to the `package.json` file _dependencies_
-
-   `--save-optional` installs and adds the entry to the `package.json` file _optionalDependencies_

-   `--no-optional` will prevent optional dependencies from being installed

Shorthands of the flags can also be used:

-   -S: --save
-
-   -D: --save-dev

-   -O: --save-optional

The difference between _devDependencies_ and _dependencies_ is that the former contains development tools, like a testing library, while the latter is bundled with the app in production.

As for the _optionalDependencies_ the difference is that build failure of the dependency will not cause installation to fail. But it is your program's responsibility to handle the lack of the dependency. Read more about [optional dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#optionaldependencies).

### Updating packages

Updating is also made easy, by running

```bash

npm update

```

`npm` will check all packages for a newer version that satisfies your versioning constraints.

You can specify a single package to update as well:

```bash

npm update <package-name>

```

## Versioning

In addition to plain downloads, `npm` also manages **versioning**, so you can specify any specific version of a package, or require a version higher or lower than what you need.

Many times you'll find that a library is only compatible with a major release of another library.

Or a bug in the latest release of a lib, still unfixed, is causing an issue.

Specifying an explicit version of a library also helps to keep everyone on the same exact version of a package, so that the whole team runs the same version until the `package.json` file is updated.

In all those cases, versioning helps a lot, and `npm` follows the semantic versioning (semver) standard.

## Running Tasks

The package.json file supports a format for specifying command line tasks that can be run by using

```bash

npm run <task-name>

```

For example:

```js
//on
{
    "scripts": {
        "start-dev": "node lib/server-development",

        "start": "node lib/server-production"
    }
}
```

It's very common to use this feature to run Webpack:

```js
//on
{
    "scripts": {
        "watch": "webpack --watch --progress --colors --config webpack.conf.js",

        "dev": "webpack --progress --colors --config webpack.conf.js",

        "prod": "NODE_ENV=production webpack -p --config webpack.conf.js"
    }
}
```

So instead of typing those long commands, which are easy to forget or mistype, you can run

```bash

$ npm run watch

$ npm run dev

$ npm run prod

```

# Where does npm install the packages?

description: 'How to find out where npm installs the packages'

When you install a package using `npm` you can perform 2 types of installation:

-   a local install
-
-   a global install

By default, when you type an `npm install` command, like:

```bash

npm install lodash

```

the package is installed in the current file tree, under the `node_modules` subfolder.

As this happens, `npm` also adds the `lodash` entry in the `dependencies` property of the `package.json` file present in the current folder.

A global installation is performed using the `-g` flag:

```bash

npm install -g lodash

```

When this happens, npm won't install the package under the local folder, but instead, it will use a global location.

Where, exactly?

The `npm root -g` command will tell you where that exact location is on your machine.

On macOS or Linux this location could be `/usr/local/lib/node_modules`.

On Windows it could be `C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules`

If you use `nvm` to manage Node.js versions, however, that location would differ.

I, for example, use `nvm` and my packages location was shown as `/Users/joe/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.0/lib/node_modules`.

# How to use or execute a package installed using npm

description: 'How to include and use in your code a package installed in your node_modules folder'

When you install a package into your `node_modules` folder using `npm` , or also globally, how do you use it in your Node.js code?

Say you install `lodash`, the popular JavaScript utility library, using

```bash

npm install lodash

```

This is going to install the package in the local `node_modules` folder.

To use it in your code, you just need to import it into your program using `require`:

```js
//
const _ = require('lodash');
```

What if your package is an executable?

In this case, it will put the executable file under the `node_modules/.bin/` folder.

One easy way to demonstrate this is [cowsay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay).

The cowsay package provides a command line program that can be executed to make a cow say something (and other animals as well 🦊).

When you install the package using `npm install cowsay`, it will install itself and a few dependencies in the `node_modules` folder:

![The node_modules folder content](images/node_modules-content.png)

There is a hidden `.bin` folder, which contains symbolic links to the cowsay binaries:

![The binary files](images/binary-files.png)

How do you execute those?

You can of course type `./node_modules/.bin/cowsay` to run it, and it works, but `npx`, included in the recent versions of `npm` (since 5.2), is a much better option. You just run:

```bash

npx cowsay

```

and `npx` will find the package location.

# The package.json guide

description: 'The package.json file is a key element in lots of app codebases based on the Node.js ecosystem.'

If you work with JavaScript, or you've ever interacted with a JavaScript project, Node.js or a frontend project, you surely met the `package.json` file.

What's that for? What should you know about it, and what are some of the cool things you can do with it?

The `package.json` file is kind of a manifest for your project. It can do a lot of things, completely unrelated. It's a central repository of configuration for tools, for example. It's also where `npm` and `yarn` store the names and versions for all the installed packages.

## The file structure

Here's an example package.json file:

```js
//on
{
}
```

It's empty! There are no fixed requirements of what should be in a `package.json` file, for an application. The only requirement is that it respects the JSON format, otherwise it cannot be read by programs that try to access its properties programmatically.

If you're building a Node.js package that you want to distribute over `npm` things change radically, and you must have a set of properties that will help other people use it. We'll see more about this later on.

This is another package.json:

```js
//on
{
    "name": "test-project"
}
```

It defines a `name` property, which tells the name of the app, or package, that's contained in the same folder where this file lives.

Here's a much more complex example, which was extracted from a sample Vue.js application:

```js
//on
{
    "name": "test-project",

there are _lots_ of things going on here:

-   `version` indicates the current version
-
-   `name` sets the application/package name
-
-   `description` is a brief description of the app/package
-
-   `main` sets the entry point for the application
-
-   `private` if set to `true` prevents the app/package to be accidental
-
-   `scripts` defines a set of node scripts you can run

-   `dependencies` sets a list of `npm` packages installed as dependencies

-   `devDependencies` sets a list of `npm` packages installed as development dependencies

-   `engines` sets which versions of Node.js this package/app works on

-   `browserslist` is used to tell which browsers (and their versions) you want to support

All those properties are used by either `npm` or other tools that we can use.

## Properties breakdown

Most of those properties are only used on <https://www.npmjs.com/>, others by scripts that interact with your code, like `npm` or others.

### name

Sets the package name.

Example:

```js
//on

"name": "test-project"

```

The name must be less than 214 characters, must not have spaces, it can only contain lowercase letters, hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`).

This is because when a package is published on `npm`, it gets its own URL based on this property.

If you published this package publicly on GitHub, a good value for this property is the GitHub repository name.

### author

Lists the package author name

Example:

```js
//on
{
    "author": "Joe <joe@whatever.com> (https://whatever.com)"
}
```

Can also be used with this format:

```js
//on
{
    "author": {
        "name": "Joe",

        "email": "joe@whatever.com",

        "url": "https://whatever.com"
    }
}
```

### contributors

As well as the author, the project can have one or more contributors. This property is an array that lists them.

Example:

```js
//on
{
    "contributors": ["Joe <joe@whatever.com> (https://whatever.com)"]
}
```

Can also be used with this format:

```js
//on
{
    "contributors": [
        {
            "name": "Joe",

            "email": "joe@whatever.com",

            "url": "https://whatever.com"
        }
    ]
}
```

### bugs

Links to the package issue tracker, most likely a GitHub issues page

Example:

```js
//on
{
    "bugs": "https://github.com/whatever/package/issues"
}
```

### homepage

Sets the package homepage

Example:

```js
//on
{
    "homepage": "https://whatever.com/package"
}
```

### version

Indicates the current version of the package.

Example:

```js
//on

"version": "1.0.0"

```

This property follows the semantic versioning (semver) notation for versions, which means the version is always expressed with 3 numbers: `x.x.x`.

The first number is the major version, the second the minor version and the third is the patch version.

There is a meaning in these numbers: a release that only fixes bugs is a patch release, a release that introduces backward-compatible changes is a minor release, a major release can have breaking changes.

### license

Indicates the license of the package.

Example:

```js
//on

"license": "MIT"

```

### keywords

This property contains an array of keywords that associate with what your package does.

Example:

```js
//on

"keywords": [

  "email",

  "machine learning",

  "ai"

]

```

This helps people find your package when navigating similar packages, or when browsing the <https://www.npmjs.com/> website.

### description

This property contains a brief description of the package

Example:

```js
//on

"description": "A package to work with strings"

```

This is especially useful if you decide to publish your package to `npm` so that people can find out what the package is about.

### repository

This property specifies where this package repository is located.

Example:

```js
//on

"repository": "github:whatever/testing",

```

Notice the `github` prefix. There are other popular services baked in:

```js
//on

"repository": "gitlab:whatever/testing",

```

```js
//on

"repository": "bitbucket:whatever/testing",

```

You can explicitly set the version control system:

```js
//on

"repository": {

  "type": "git",

  "url": "https://github.com/whatever/testing.git"

}

```

You can use different version control systems:

```js
//on

"repository": {

  "type": "svn",

  "url": "..."

}

```

### main

Sets the entry point for the package.

When you import this package in an application, that's where the application will search for the module exports.

Example:

```js
//on

"main": "src/main.js"

```

### private

if set to `true` prevents the app/package to be accidentally published on `npm`

Example:

```js
//on

"private": true

```

### scripts

Defines a set of node scripts you can run

Example:

```js
//on

"scripts": {

  "dev": "webpack-dev-server --inline --progress --config build/webpack.dev.conf.js",

  "start": "npm run dev",

  "unit": "jest --config test/unit/jest.conf.js --coverage",

  "test": "npm run unit",

  "lint": "eslint --ext .js,.vue src test/unit",

  "build": "node build/build.js"

}

```

These scripts are command line applications. You can run them by calling `npm run XXXX` or `yarn XXXX`, where `XXXX` is the command name. Example: `npm run dev`.

You can use any name you want for a command, and scripts can do literally anything you want.

### dependencies

Sets a list of `npm` packages installed as dependencies.

When you install a package using npm or yarn:

```bash

npm install <PACKAGENAME>

yarn add <PACKAGENAME>

```

that package is automatically inserted in this list.

Example:

```js
//on

"dependencies": {

  "vue": "^2.5.2"

}

```

### devDependencies

Sets a list of `npm` packages installed as development dependencies.

They differ from `dependencies` because they are meant to be installed only on a development machine, not needed to run the code in production.

When you install a package using npm or yarn:

```bash

npm install --save-dev <PACKAGENAME>

yarn add --dev <PACKAGENAME>

```

that package is automatically inserted in this list.

Example:

```js
//on

"devDependencies": {

  "autoprefixer": "^7.1.2",

  "babel-core": "^6.22.1"

}

```

### engines

Sets which versions of Node.js and other commands this package/app work on

Example:

```js
//on

"engines": {

  "node": ">= 6.0.0",

  "npm": ">= 3.0.0",

  "yarn": "^0.13.0"

}

```

### browserslist

Is used to tell which browsers (and their versions) you want to support. It's referenced by Babel, Autoprefixer, and other tools, to only add the polyfills and fallbacks needed to the browsers you target.

Example:

```js
//on

"browserslist": [

  "> 1%",

  "last 2 versions",

  "not ie <= 8"

]

```

This configuration means you want to support the last 2 major versions of all browsers with at least 1% of usage (from the [CanIUse.com](https://caniuse.com) stats), except IE8 and lower.

([see more](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserslist))

### Command-specific properties

The `package.json` file can also host command-specific configuration, for example for Babel, ESLint, and more.

Each has a specific property, like `eslintConfig`, `babel` and others. Those are command-specific, and you can find how to use those in the respective command/project documentation.

## Package versions

You have seen in the description above version numbers like these: `~3.0.0` or `^0.13.0`. What do they mean, and which other version specifiers can you use?

That symbol specifies which updates your package accepts, from that dependency.

Given that using semver (semantic versioning) all versions have 3 digits, the first being the major release, the second the minor release and the third is the patch release, you have these "[Rules](https://nodejs.dev/learn/semantic-versioning-using-npm/)".

You can combine most of the versions in ranges, like this: `1.0.0 || >=1.1.0 <1.2.0`, to either use 1.0.0 or one release from 1.1.0 up, but lower than 1.2.0.

# The package-lock.json file

description: "The package-lock.json file is automatically generated when installing node packages. Learn what it's about"

---

In version 5, npm introduced the `package-lock.json` file.

What's that? You probably know about the `package.json` file, which is much more common and has been around for much longer.

The goal of `package-lock.json` file is to keep track of the exact version of every package that is installed so that a product is 100% reproducible in the same way even if packages are updated by their maintainers.

This solves a very specific problem that `package.json` left unsolved. In package.json you can set which versions you want to upgrade to (patch or minor), using the **semver** notation, for example:

-   if you write `~0.13.0`, you want to only update patch releases: `0.13.1` is ok, but `0.14.0` is not.
-
-   if you write `^0.13.0`, you want to get updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero number: `0.13.1`, `0.13.2` and so on. If you write `^1.13.0`, you will get patch and minor releases: `1.13.1`, `1.14.0` and so on up to `2.0.0` but not `2.0.0`.

-   if you write `0.13.0`, that is the exact version that will be used, always

You don't commit to Git your node_modules folder, which is generally huge, and when you try to replicate the project on another machine by using the `npm install` command, if you specified the `~` syntax and a patch release of a package has been released, that one is going to be installed. Same for `^` and minor releases.

> If you specify exact versions, like `0.13.0` in the example, you are not affected by this problem.

It could be you, or another person trying to initialize the project on the other side of the world by running `npm install`.

So your original project and the newly initialized project are actually different. Even if a patch or minor release should not introduce breaking changes, we all know bugs can (and so, they will) slide in.

The `package-lock.json` sets your currently installed version of each package **in stone**, and `npm` will use those exact versions when running `npm ci`.

This concept is not new, and other programming languages package managers (like Composer in PHP) use a similar system for years.

The `package-lock.json` file needs to be committed to your Git repository, so it can be fetched by other people, if the project is public or you have collaborators, or if you use Git as a source for deployments.

The dependencies versions will be updated in the `package-lock.json` file when you run `npm update`.

## An example

This is an example structure of a `package-lock.json` file we get when we run `npm install cowsay` in an empty folder:

```js
//on

  "requires": true,

    }

  }

}

```

We installed `cowsay`, which depends on

-   `get-stdin`
-
-   `optimist`
-
-   `string-width`

-   `strip-eof`

In turn, those packages require other packages, as we can see from the `requires` property that some have:

-   `ansi-regex`
-
-   `is-fullwidt
-
-   `minimist`

-   `wordwrap`

-   `strip-eof`

They are added in alphabetical order into the file, and each one has a `version` field, a `resolved` field that points to the package location, and an `integrity` string that we can use to verify the package.

# Computer Networking & Socket Programming

Socket programming is the development of programs for [Computer Networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). Networking applications are loosely based off of the top most layers of the conceptual 7-layer model called the [OSI Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). The layers most relevant to socket programmers is layer 4, the [Transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer), and layer 7, the [Application layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer). Specific protocols are implemented at each layer, and are instrumental for the functionality of the internet.

Node.js exposes extensive API's for implementing these protocols so developers can create socket programming applications. The most common example is the `http` module. [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) exists on the Application layer of the OSI Model; if you want to learn more about the `http` module, read the Node.js [http documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) or the Nodejs.dev [guide](https://nodejs.dev/the-nodejs-http-module). Another socket programming Node.js module is the `dgram` module for [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) communication. UDP exists on the Transport layer; for more information about this technology read the Node.js [dgram documentaion](https://nodejs.org/api/dgram.html). More importantly, the `net` module, which this guide is all about, provides an extensive API for a stream-based TCP server. [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) exists on the Transport layer of the OSI Model and is what HTTP is implemented on top of.

> TCP is a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications communicating via an internet protocol (IP) network.

>

> ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)

## Net Module - Getting Started

The key part of the `net` module is the `net.Socket` class. A socket instance in Node.js is both a [duplex stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_duplex_and_transform_streams) and an [event emitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter). This means it is readable, writable, and can utilize the event loop. Sockets can be created by the user and by Node.js, and they are the programmatic object for communicating. Sockets must connect to a `net.Server` class instance; a socket connection to a server is often referred to as a _client connection_. Every socket connection is considered "private" in the sense that the only entities with access to the connection is the server and the client. A server instance **can** have multiple client connections, but will maintain separate communication streams with each connection.

Lets look at the simplest example of a TCP server, an echo server. An _echo server_ is one which returns the same message sent to it.

```js
//
const net = require('net');

// Create a TCP server using the `net.createServer()` method

// The callback method is an event listener for the 'connection' event

// This method is passed a single parameter, the client socket connection

const server = net.createServer((client) => {
    console.log('Client connected!');

    // The client is a stream, set the data encoding to utf8

    client.setEncoding('utf8');

    // Manual implementation of an echo server:

    client.on('data', (data) => {
        // data is a UTF-8 string

        console.log(data); // log the message from the client to the server

        client.write(data); // write the same message back to the client
    });

    // Automatic implementation of an echo server:

    // client is a stream, use the Stream.pipe prototype method to connect it's

    // read stream to it's write stream

    // client.pipe(client)
});

// Start the server on localhost:8124

// The `http` module, inherits this method for its own http.Server.listen

server.listen(8124, 'localhost', () => {
    console.log('Waiting for connection...');
});
```

With this server running, connect to it using your system's command-line TCP interface. The two most common are telnet and netcat. If you're unsure which, try both! If neither work, search on Google for "telnet alternative for \<your OS\>".

In another terminal connect to the running TCP server:

```bash

telnet localhost 8124

# or

nc localhost 8124

```

If you see the message `Client connected!` in the TCP server terminal, you can begin sending messages from the client connection terminal. Whatever you send should be sent back to you immediatly (if you copy-and-pasted the code from above directly, you'll receive your message twice because their are two echo implementations). Disconnecting is easy; use your terminal's quit keystroke (commonly `CTRL+C`) or exit the terminal application instance.

Great work! You have succesfully implemented your first TCP server-client connection.

## Example using `net.createConnection()`

Before starting, open two terminals and startup the Node.js repl (you can also use two files called `server.js` and `client.js` respectively). In the following example, we will create a TCP server and a connection to that server using the `net` module. By doing so, the interactivity is not the same as the previous echo example. In fact, without using other core Node.js modules, this example is completely non-interactive. The client code will disconnect itself at the end of its execution.

```js
//
// In the first repl, create and start a server

const net = require('net');

const server = net.createServer((client) => {
    console.log('Client connected'); // log the client has connected to the server

    client.setEncoding('utf8'); // set the data encoding

    client.write('Hello from the server!\n'); // say hello to the new connection

    client.on('data', (data) => {
        client.write(data.toUpperCase()); // echo the client message in ALL CAPS
    });

    client.on('end', () => {
        console.log('Client disconnected'); // log the client has disconnected to the server
    });
});

server.listen(8124, 'localhost', () => {
    console.log('Waiting for connection...');
});
```

```js
//
// In the second repl, create and connect a client

const net = require('net');

const client = net.createConnection(8124, 'localhost', () => {
    console.log('Connected to Server!'); // log the server connection to the client

    client.write('Hello from the client!\n'); // say hello to the server
});

client.setEncoding('utf8'); // set the encoding

client.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(data); // log messages from the server to the client

    client.end(); // end the connection after
});

client.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Disconnected from server'); // log the server disconnection to the client
});
```

The second example introduces an additional event listener `'end'`. This is very useful for determining when a socket connection is terminated. In the client code, the call to `client.end()` is the programatic way of ending a socket connection.

## Conclusion

Fantastic work! With these two examples you should have what you need to get started building your own TCP communication networks. This guide only brushes the surface of socket programming applications, but the most important take away here is that Node.js implements TCP socket connections as [duplex streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_duplex_and_transform_streams) and [event emitters](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter). Understanding those two concepts will benefit your overall understanding of the `net` module.

For more capabilities of the `net` module read the Node.js [net documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html).

To learn more, try completing the following challenges:

-   Using `readline` or `stream` modules, create an interactive client connection script

    -   this can build on the second example provided in this guide

-   Create a group-chat TCP server

    -   hint: you can hold multiple client connections in an array

    -   use multiple arrays for a multi-channel chat server

    -   for an extra challenge try to implement a basic user-store for authentication of user accounts

-   Create a mini CRUD database server using an idiomatic chat-command interface

    -   The chat-command interface could use keywords such as `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` so the client can send instructions to the server

    -   Data can be persisted between sessions using `fs` to read and write data to files

# Find the installed version of an npm package

description: 'How to find out which version of a particular package you have installed in your app'

To see the version of all installed npm packages, including their dependencies:

```bash

npm list

```

For example:

```bash

❯ npm list

/Users/joe/dev/node/cowsay

└─┬ cowsay@1.3.1

  ├── get-stdin@5.0.1

  ├─┬ optimist@0.6.1

  │ ├── minimist@0.0.10

  │ └── wordwrap@0.0.3

  ├─┬ string-width@2.1.1

  │ ├── is-fullwidth-code-point@2.0.0

  │ └─┬ strip-ansi@4.0.0

  │   └── ansi-regex@3.0.0

  └── strip-eof@1.0.0

```

You can also just open the `package-lock.json` file, but this involves some visual scanning.

`npm list -g` is the same, but for globally installed packages.

To get only your top-level packages (basically, the ones you told npm to install and you listed in the `package.json`), run `npm list --depth=0`:

```bash

❯ npm list --depth=0

/Users/joe/dev/node/cowsay

└── cowsay@1.3.1

```

You can get the version of a specific package by specifying its name:

```bash

❯ npm list cowsay

/Users/joe/dev/node/cowsay

└── cowsay@1.3.1

```

This also works for dependencies of packages you installed:

```bash

❯ npm list minimist

/Users/joe/dev/node/cowsay

└─┬ cowsay@1.3.1

  └─┬ optimist@0.6.1

    └── minimist@0.0.10

```

If you want to see what's the latest available version of the package on the npm repository, run `npm view [package_name] version`:

```bash

❯ npm view cowsay version

1.3.1

```

# Install an older version of an npm package

description: 'Learn how to install an older version of an npm package, something that might be useful to solve a compatibility problem'

You can install an old version of an npm package using the `@` syntax:

```bash

npm install <package>@<version>

```

Example:

```bash

npm install cowsay

```

installs version 1.3.1 (at the time of writing).

Install version 1.2.0 with:

```bash

npm install cowsay@1.2.0

```

The same can be done with global packages:

```bash

npm install -g webpack@4.16.4

```

You might also be interested in listing all the previous versions of a package. You can do it with `npm view <package> versions`:

```bash

❯ npm view cowsay versions

[ '1.0.0',

  '1.0.1',

  '1.0.2',

  '1.0.3',

  '1.1.0',

  '1.1.1',

  '1.1.2',

  '1.1.3',

  '1.1.4',

  '1.1.5',

  '1.1.6',

  '1.1.7',

  '1.1.8',

  '1.1.9',

  '1.2.0',

  '1.2.1',

  '1.3.0',

  '1.3.1' ]

```

# Update all the Node.js dependencies to their latest version

description: 'How do you update all the npm dependencies store in the package.json file, to their latest version available?'

When you install a package using `npm install <packagename>`, the latest available version of the package is downloaded and put in the `node_modules` folder, and a corresponding entry is added to the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files that are present in your current folder.

npm calculates the dependencies and installs the latest available version of those as well.

Let's say you install [`cowsay`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay), a cool command line tool that lets you make a cow say _things_.

When you `npm install cowsay`, this entry is added to the `package.json` file:

```js
//on
{
    "dependencies": {
        "cowsay": "^1.3.1"
    }
}
```

and this is an extract of `package-lock.json`, where we removed the nested dependencies for clarity:

```js
//on
{
    "requires": true,

    "lockfileVersion": 1,

    "dependencies": {
        "cowsay": {
            "version": "1.3.1",

            "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/cowsay/-/cowsay-1.3.1.tgz",

            "integrity": "sha512-3PVFe6FePVtPj1HTeLin9v8WyLl+VmM1l1H/5P+BTTDkMAjufp+0F9eLjzRnOHzVAYeIYFF5po5NjRrgefnRMQ==",

            "requires": {
                "get-stdin": "^5.0.1",

                "optimist": "~0.6.1",

                "string-width": "~2.1.1",

                "strip-eof": "^1.0.0"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Now those 2 files tell us that we installed version `1.3.1` of cowsay, and our rule for updates is `^1.3.1`, which for the npm versioning rules means that npm can update to patch and minor releases: `1.3.2`, `1.4.0` and so on.

If there is a new minor or patch release and we type `npm update`, the installed version is updated, and the `package-lock.json` file diligently filled with the new version.

Since npm version 5.0.0, `npm update` will update the `package.json` with the updated version. Use `npm update --no-save` to not update `package.json`.

To discover new releases of the packages, you run `npm outdated`.

Here's the list of a few outdated packages in one repository that wasn't updated for quite a while:

![alt-text](images/outdated-packages.png)

Some of those updates are major releases. Running `npm update` won't update the version of those. Major releases are never updated in this way because they (by definition) introduce breaking changes, and `npm` wants to save you trouble.

To update all packages to a new major version, install the `npm-check-updates` package globally:

```bash

npm install -g npm-check-updates

```

then run it:

```bash

ncu -u

```

this will upgrade all the version hints in the `package.json` file, to `dependencies` and `devDependencies`, so npm can install the new major version.

You are now ready to run the update:

```bash

npm update

```

If you just downloaded the project without the `node_modules` dependencies and you want to install the shiny new versions first, just run

```bash

npm install

```

# Semantic Versioning using npm

description: 'Semantic Versioning is a convention used to provide a meaning to versions'

If there's one great thing in Node.js packages, it's that they all agreed on using Semantic Versioning for their version numbering.

The Semantic Versioning concept is simple: all versions have 3 digits: `x.y.z`.

-   the first digit is the major version
-
-   the second digit is the minor version

-   the third digit is the patch version

When you make a new release, you don't just up a number as you please, but you have rules:

-   you up the major version when you make incompatible API changes
-
-   you up the minor version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner

-   you up the patch version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes

The convention is adopted all across programming languages, and it is very important that every `npm` package adheres to it, because the whole system depends on that.

Why is that so important?

Because `npm` set some rules we can use in the `package.json` file to choose which versions it can update our packages to, when we run `npm update`.

The rules use those symbols:

-   `^`
-
-   `~`
-
-   `>`
-
-   `>=`
-
-   `<`

-   `<=`

-   `=`

-   `-`

-   `||`

Let's see those rules in detail:

-   `^`: It will only do updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero number i.e there can be changes in minor version or patch version but not in major version. If you write `^13.1.0`, when running `npm update`, it can update to `13.2.0`, `13.3.0` even `13.3.1`, `13.3.2` and so on, but not to `14.0.0` or above.
-
-   `~`: if you write `~0.13.0` when running `npm update` it can
-
-   `>`: you accept any version higher than the one you specify
-
-   `>=`: you accept any version equal t
-
-   `<=`: you accept any version equal or lower to the one you specify

-   `<`: you accept any version lower than the one you specify

-   `=`: you accept that exact version

-   `-`: you accept a range of versions. Example: `2.1.0 - 2.6.2`

-   `||`: you combine sets. Example: `< 2.1 || > 2.6`

You can combine some of those notations, for example use `1.0.0 || >=1.1.0 <1.2.0` to either use 1.0.0 or one release from 1.1.0 up, but lower than 1.2.0.

There are other rules, too:

-   no symbol: you accept only that specific version you specify (`1.2.1`)
-
-   `latest`: you want to use the latest version available

# Uninstalling npm packages

description: 'How to uninstall an npm Node.js package, locally or globally'

To uninstall a package you have previously installed **locally** (using `npm install <package-name>` in the `node_modules` folder, run

```bash

npm uninstall <package-name>

```

from the project root folder (the folder that contains the node_modules folder).

Using the `-S` flag, or `--save`, this operation will also remove the reference in the `package.json` file.

package.json will be automatically updated with devDependency and dependency once you uninstall npm package.

If the package is installed **globally**, you need to add the `-g` / `--global` flag:

```bash

npm uninstall -g <package-name>

```

for example:

```bash

npm uninstall -g webpack

```

and you can run this command from anywhere you want on your system because the folder where you currently are does not matter.

# npm global or local packages

description: 'When is a package best installed globally? Why?'

The main difference between local and global packages is this:

-   **local packages** are installed in the directory where you run `npm install <package-name>`, and they are put in the `node_modules` folder under this directory
-
-   **global packages** are all put in a single place in your system (exactly where depends on your setup), regardless of where you run `npm install -g <package-name>`

In your code you can only require local packages:

```js
//
require('package-name');
```

so when should you install in one way or another?

In general, **all packages should be installed locally**.

This makes sure you can have dozens of applications in your computer, all running a different version of each package if needed.

Updating a global package would make all your projects use the new release, and as you can imagine this might cause nightmares in terms of maintenance, as some packages might break compatibility with further dependencies, and so on.

All projects have their own local version of a package, even if this might appear like a waste of resources, it's minimal compared to the possible negative consequences.

A package **should be installed globally** when it provides an executable command that you run from the shell (CLI), and it's reused across projects.

You can also install executable commands locally and run them using npx, but some packages are just better installed globally.

Great examples of popular global packages which you might know are

-   `npm`
-
-   `create-rea
-
-   `vue-cli`
-
-   `grunt-cli`
-
-   `mocha`

-   `react-native-cli`

-   `gatsby-cli`

-   `forever`

-   `nodemon`

You probably have some packages installed globally already on your system. You can see them by running

```bash

npm list -g --depth 0

```

on your command line.

# npm dependencies and devDependencies

description: 'When is a package a dependency, and when is it a dev dependency?'

When you install an npm package using `npm install <package-name>`, you are installing it as a **dependency**.

The package is automatically listed in the package.json file, under the `dependencies` list (as of npm 5: before you had to manually specify `--save`).

When you add the `-D` flag, or `--save-dev`, you are installing it as a development dependency, which adds it to the `devDependencies` list.

Development dependencies are intended as development-only packages, that are unneeded in production. For example testing packages, webpack or Babel.

When you go in production, if you type `npm install` and the folder contains a `package.json` file, they are installed, as npm assumes this is a development deploy.

You need to set the `--production` flag (`npm install --production`) to avoid installing those development dependencies.

# The npx Node.js Package Runner

description: 'npx is a very cool way to run Node.js code, and provides many useful features'

`npx` is a very powerful command that's been available in **npm** starting version 5.2, released in July 2017.

> If you don't want to install npm, you can [install npx as a standalone package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

`npx` lets you run code built with Node.js and published through the npm registry.

## Easily run local commands

Node.js developers used to publish most of the executable commands as global packages, in order for them to be in the path and executable immediately.

This was a pain because you could not really install different versions of the same command.

Running `npx commandname` automatically finds the correct reference of the command inside the `node_modules` folder of a project, without needing to know the exact path, and without requiring the package to be installed globally and in the user's path.

## Installation-less command execution

There is another great feature of `npx`, which is allowing to run commands without first installing them.

This is pretty useful, mostly because:

1. you don't need to install anything

2. you can run different versions of the same command, using the syntax @version

A typical demonstration of using `npx` is through the `cowsay` command. `cowsay` will print a cow saying what you wrote in the command. For example:

`cowsay "Hello"` will print

```bash

 _______

< Hello >

 -------

        \   ^__^

         \  (oo)\_______

            (__)\       )\/\

                ||----w |

                ||     ||

```

This only works if you have the `cowsay` command globally installed from npm previously. Otherwise you'll get an error when you try to run the command.

`npx` allows you to run that npm command without installing it first. If the command isn't found, `npx` will install it into a central cache:

```bash

npx cowsay "Hello"

```

will do the job.

Now, this is a funny useless command.

Other scenarios include:

-   running the `vue` CLI tool to create new applications and run them: `npx @vue/cli create my-vue-app`
-
-   creating a new React app using `create-react-app`: `npx create-react-app my-react-app`

and many more.

## Run some code using a different Node.js version

Use the `@` to specify the version, and combine that with the [`node` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node):

```bash

npx node@10 -v #v10.18.1

npx node@12 -v #v12.14.1

```

This helps to avoid tools like `nvm` or the other Node.js version management tools.

## Run arbitrary code snippets directly from a URL

`npx` does not limit you to the packages published on the npm registry.

You can run code that sits in a GitHub gist, for example:

```bash

npx https://gist.github.com/zkat/4bc19503fe9e9309e2bfaa2c58074d32

```

Of course, you need to be careful when running code that you do not control, as with great power comes great responsibility.

# 'The Node.js Event Loop'

description: 'The Event Loop is one of the most important aspects to understand about Node.js'

## Introduction

The **Event Loop** is one of the most important aspects to understand about Node.js.

Why is this so important? Because it explains how Node.js can be asynchronous and have non-blocking I/O, and so it explains basically the "killer app" of Node.js, the thing that made it this successful.

The Node.js JavaScript code runs on a single thread. There is just one thing happening at a time.

This is a limitation that's actually very helpful, as it simplifies a lot how you program without worrying about concurrency issues.

You just need to pay attention to how you write your code and avoid anything that could block the thread, like synchronous network calls or infinite loops.

In general, in most browsers there is an event loop for every browser tab, to make every process isolated and avoid a web page with infinite loops or heavy processing to block your entire browser.

The environment manages multiple concurrent event loops, to handle API calls for example. Web Workers run in their own event loop as well.

You mainly need to be concerned that _your code_ will run on a single event loop, and write code with this thing in mind to avoid blocking it.

## Blocking the event loop

Any JavaScript code that takes too long to return back control to the event loop will block the execution of any JavaScript code in the page, even block the UI thread, and the user cannot click around, scroll the page, and so on.

Almost all the I/O primitives in JavaScript are non-blocking. Network requests, filesystem operations, and so on. Being blocking is the exception, and this is why JavaScript is based so much on callbacks, and more recently on promises and async/await.

## The call stack

The call stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack.

The event loop continuously checks the **call stack** to see if there's any function that needs to run.

While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack and executes each one in order.

You know the error stack trace you might be familiar with, in the debugger or in the browser console? The browser looks up the function names in the call stack to inform you which function originates the current call:

![Exception call stack](images/exception-call-stack.png)

## A simple event loop explanation

Let's pick an example:

<iframe title="A simple event loop explanation" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/nodejs-dev-0003-01?index.js&zenmode=1&view=editor" alt="nodejs-dev-0003-01 " style="height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;">
</iframe>
<br>

```js
//
const bar = () => console.log('bar');

const baz = () => console.log('baz');

const foo = () => {
    console.log('foo');

    bar();

    baz();
};

foo();
```

This code prints

```txt

foo

bar

baz

```

as expected.-->

When this code runs, first `foo()` is called. Inside `foo()` we first call `bar()`, then we call `baz()`.

At this point the call stack looks like this:

![Call stack first example](images/call-stack-first-example.png)

The event loop on every iteration looks if there's something in the call stack, and executes it:

![Execution order first example](images/execution-order-first-example.png)

until the call stack is empty.

## Queuing function execution

The above example looks normal, there's nothing special about it: JavaScript finds things to execute, runs them in order.

Let's see how to defer a function until the stack is clear.

The use case of `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)` is to call a function, but execute it once every other function in the code has executed.

Take this example:

<iframe title="Queuing function execution" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/nodejs-dev-0004-01?index.js&zenmode=1&view=editor" alt="nodejs-dev-0004-01 on StackBlitz" style="height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;">
</iframe>
<br>

```js
//

const bar = () => console.log('bar')

const baz = () => console.log('baz')

const foo = () => {

  console.log('foo')

  setTimeout(bar, 0)

  baz()

}

foo()

```-->

This code prints, maybe surprisingly:

```bash

foo

baz

bar

```

When this code runs, first foo() is called. Inside foo() we first call setTimeout, passing `bar` as an argument, and we instruct it to run immediately as fast as it can, passing 0 as the timer. Then we call baz().

At this point the call stack looks like this:

![Call stack second example](images/call-stack-second-example.png)

Here is the execution order for all the functions in our program:

![Execution order second example](images/execution-order-second-example.png)

Why is this happening?

## The Message Queue

When setTimeout() is called, the Browser or Node.js starts the timer. Once the timer expires, in this case immediately as we put 0 as the timeout, the callback function is put in the **Message Queue**.

The Message Queue is also where user-initiated events like click or keyboard events, or fetch responses are queued before your code has the opportunity to react to them. Or also DOM events like `onload`.

**The loop gives priority to the call stack, and it first processes everything it finds in the call stack, and once there's nothing in there, it goes to pick up things in the message queue.**

We don't have to wait for functions like `setTimeout`, fetch or other things to do their own work, because they are provided by the browser, and they live on their own threads. For example, if you set the `setTimeout` timeout to 2 seconds, you don't have to wait 2 seconds - the wait happens elsewhere.

## ES6 Job Queue

ECMAScript 2015 introduced the concept of the Job Queue, which is used by Promises (also introduced in ES6/ES2015). It's a way to execute the result of an async function as soon as possible, rather than being put at the end of the call stack.

Promises that resolve before the current function ends will be executed right after the current function.

I find nice the analogy of a rollercoaster ride at an amusement park: the message queue puts you at the back of the queue, behind all the other people, where you will have to wait for your turn, while the job queue is the fastpass ticket that lets you take another ride right after you finished the previous one.

Example:

<iframe title="ECMAScript 2015 Job Queue" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/nodejs-dev-0005-01?index.js&zenmode=1&view=editor" alt="nodejs-dev-0005-01 on StackBlitz" style="height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;">
</iframe>
<br>

```js
//
const bar = () => console.log('bar');

const baz = () => console.log('baz');

const foo = () => {
    console.log('foo');

    setTimeout(bar, 0);

    new Promise((resolve, reject) => resolve('should be right after baz, before bar')).then((resolve) => console.log(resolve));

    baz();
};

foo();
```

This prints

```txt

foo

baz

should be right after baz, before bar

bar

```-->

That's a big difference between Promises (and Async/await, which is built on promises) and plain old asynchronous functions through `setTimeout()` or other platform APIs.

Finally, here's what the call stack looks like for the example above:

![Call stack third example](images/call-stack-third-example.png)

# 'Understanding process.nextTick()'

description: 'The Node.js process.nextTick function interacts with the event loop in a special way'

As you try to understand the Node.js event loop, one important part of it is `process.nextTick()`.

Every time the event loop takes a full trip, we call it a tick.

When we pass a function to `process.nextTick()`, we instruct the engine to invoke this function at the end of the current operation, before the next event loop tick starts:

```js
//
process.nextTick(() => {
    //do something
});
```

The event loop is busy processing the current function code.

When this operation ends, the JS engine runs all the functions passed to `nextTick` calls during that operation.

It's the way we can tell the JS engine to process a function asynchronously (after the current function), but as soon as possible, not queue it.

Calling `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)` will execute the function at the end of next tick, much later than when using `nextTick()` which prioritizes the call and executes it just before the beginning of the next tick.

Use `nextTick()` when you want to make sure that in the next event loop iteration that code is already executed.

# Introduction to Node.js

description: "Getting started guide to Node.js, the server-side JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js is built on top of the Google Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, and it's mainly used to create web servers - but it's not limited to just that."

---

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.

This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.

Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.

## A Vast Number of Libraries

npm with its simple structure helped the ecosystem of Node.js proliferate, and now the npm registry hosts over 1,000,000 open source packages you can freely use.

## An Example Node.js Application

The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:

<iframe title="Hello world web server" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/nodejs-dev-0001-01?embed=1&file=index.js&zenmode=1" alt="nodejs-dev-0001-01 on StackBlitz" style="height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;">
</iframe>
<br>

```js
//
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';

const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;

    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');

    res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

To run this snippet, save it as a `server.js` file and run `node server.js` in your terminal.-->

This code first includes the Node.js [`http` module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html).

Node.js has a fantastic [standard library](https://nodejs.org/api/), including first-class support for networking.

The `createServer()` method of `http` creates a new HTTP server and returns it.

The server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.

Whenever a new request is received, the [`request` event](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request) is called, providing two objects: a request (an [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object) and a response (an [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) object).

Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.

The first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.

The second is used to return data to the caller.

In this case with:

```js
//
res.statusCode = 200;
```

we set the statusCode property to 200, to indicate a successful response.

We set the Content-Type header:

```js
//
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
```

and we close the response, adding the content as an argument to `end()`:

```js
//
res.end('Hello World\n');
```

## Node.js Frameworks and Tools

# 'Understanding setImmediate()'

description: 'The Node.js setImmediate function interacts with the event loop in a special way'

When you want to execute some piece of code asynchronously, but as soon as possible, one option is to use the `setImmediate()` function provided by Node.js:

```js
//
setImmediate(() => {
    //run something
});
```

Any function passed as the setImmediate() argument is a callback that's executed in the next iteration of the event loop.

How is `setImmediate()` different from `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)` (passing a 0ms timeout), and from `process.nextTick()`?

A function passed to `process.nextTick()` is going to be executed on the current iteration of the event loop, after the current operation ends. This means it will always execute before `setTimeout` and `setImmediate`.

A `setTimeout()` callback with a 0ms delay is very similar to `setImmediate()`. The execution order will depend on various factors, but they will be both run in the next iteration of the event loop.

# Discover JavaScript Timers

description: 'When writing JavaScript code, you might want to delay the execution of a function. Learn how to use setTimeout and setInterval to schedule functions in the future'

## `setTimeout()`

When writing JavaScript code, you might want to delay the execution of a function.

This is the job of `setTimeout`. You specify a callback function to execute later, and a value expressing how later you want it to run, in milliseconds:

```js
//
setTimeout(() => {
    // runs after 2 seconds
}, 2000);

setTimeout(() => {
    // runs after 50 milliseconds
}, 50);
```

This syntax defines a new function. You can call whatever other function you want in there, or you can pass an existing function name, and a set of parameters:

```js
//
const myFunction = (firstParam, secondParam) => {
    // do something
};

// runs after 2 seconds

setTimeout(myFunction, 2000, firstParam, secondParam);
```

`setTimeout` returns the timer id. This is generally not used, but you can store this id, and clear it if you want to delete this scheduled function execution:

```js
//
const id = setTimeout(() => {
    // should run after 2 seconds
}, 2000);

// I changed my mind

clearTimeout(id);
```

### Zero delay

If you specify the timeout delay to `0`, the callback function will be executed as soon as possible, but after the current function execution:

```js
//
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('after ');
}, 0);

console.log(' before ');
```

This code will print

```bash

before

after

```

This is especially useful to avoid blocking the CPU on intensive tasks and let other functions be executed while performing a heavy calculation, by queuing functions in the scheduler.

> Some browsers (IE and Edge) implement a `setImmediate()` method that does this same exact functionality, but it's not standard and [unavailable on other browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=setimmediate). But it's a standard function in Node.js.

## `setInterval()`

`setInterval` is a function similar to `setTimeout`, with a difference: instead of running the callback function once, it will run it forever, at the specific time interval you specify (in milliseconds):

```js
//
setInterval(() => {
    // runs every 2 seconds
}, 2000);
```

The function above runs every 2 seconds unless you tell it to stop, using `clearInterval`, passing it the interval id that `setInterval` returned:

```js
//
const id = setInterval(() => {
    // runs every 2 seconds
}, 2000);

clearInterval(id);
```

It's common to call `clearInterval` inside the setInterval callback function, to let it auto-determine if it should run again or stop. For example this code runs something unless App.somethingIWait has the value `arrived`:

```js
//
const interval = setInterval(() => {
    if (App.somethingIWait === 'arrived') {
        clearInterval(interval);

        return;
    }

    // otherwise do things
}, 100);
```

## Recursive setTimeout

`setInterval` starts a function every n milliseconds, without any consideration about when a function finished its execution.

If a function always takes the same amount of time, it's all fine:

![setInterval working fine](images/setinterval-ok.png)

Maybe the function takes different execution times, depending on network conditions for example:

![setInterval varying duration](images/setinterval-varying-duration.png)

And maybe one long execution overlaps the next one:

![setInterval overlapping](images/setinterval-overlapping.png)

To avoid this, you can schedule a recursive setTimeout to be called when the callback function finishes:

```js
//
const myFunction = () => {
    // do something

    setTimeout(myFunction, 1000);
};

setTimeout(myFunction, 1000);
```

to achieve this scenario:

![Recursive setTimeout](images/recursive-settimeout.png)

`setTimeout` and `setInterval` are available in Node.js, through the [Timers module](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html).

Node.js also provides `setImmediate()`, which is equivalent to using `setTimeout(() => {}, 0)`, mostly used to work with the Node.js Event Loop.

# 'JavaScript Asynchronous Programming and Callbacks'

description: 'JavaScript is synchronous by default, and is single threaded. This means that code cannot create new threads and run in parallel. Find out what asynchronous code means and how it looks like'

## Asynchronicity in Programming Languages

Computers are asynchronous by design.

Asynchronous means that things can happen independently of the main program flow.

In the current consumer computers, every program runs for a specific time slot and then it stops its execution to let another program continue their execution. This thing runs in a cycle so fast that it's impossible to notice. We think our computers run many programs simultaneously, but this is an illusion (except on multiprocessor machines).

Programs internally use _interrupts_, a signal that's emitted to the processor to gain the attention of the system.

I won't go into the internals of this, but just keep in mind that it's normal for programs to be asynchronous and halt their execution until they need attention, allowing the computer to execute other things in the meantime. When a program is waiting for a response from the network, it cannot halt the processor until the request finishes.

Normally, programming languages are synchronous and some provide a way to manage asynchronicity in the language or through libraries. C, Java, C#, PHP, Go, Ruby, Swift, and Python are all synchronous by default. Some of them handle async by using threads, spawning a new process.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is **synchronous** by default and is single threaded. This means that code cannot create new threads and run in parallel.

Lines of code are executed in series, one after another, for example:

```js
//
const a = 1;

const b = 2;

const c = a * b;

console.log(c);

doSomething();
```

But JavaScript was born inside the browser, its main job, in the beginning, was to respond to user actions, like `onClick`, `onMouseOver`, `onChange`, `onSubmit` and so on. How could it do this with a synchronous programming model?

The answer was in its environment. The **browser** provides a way to do it by providing a set of APIs that can handle this kind of functionality.

More recently, Node.js introduced a non-blocking I/O environment to extend this concept to file access, network calls and so on.

## Callbacks

You can't know when a user is going to click a button. So, you **define an event handler for the click event**. This event handler accepts a function, which will be called when the event is triggered:

```js
//
document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', () => {
    //item clicked
});
```

This is the so-called **callback**.

A callback is a simple function that's passed as a value to another function, and will only be executed when the event happens. We can do this because JavaScript has first-class functions, which can be assigned to variables and passed around to other functions (called **higher-order functions**)

It's common to wrap all your client code in a `load` event listener on the `window` object, which runs the callback function only when the page is ready:

```js
//
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    //window loaded
    //do what you want
});
```

Callbacks are used everywhere, not just in DOM events.

One common example is by using timers:

```js
//
setTimeout(() => {
    // runs after 2 seconds
}, 2000);
```

XHR requests also accept a callback, in this example by assigning a function to a property that will be called when a particular event occurs (in this case, the state of the request changes):

```js
//
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
        xhr.status === 200 ? console.log(xhr.responseText) : console.error('error');
    }
};

xhr.open('GET', 'https://yoursite.com');

xhr.send();
```

## Handling errors in callbacks

How do you handle errors with callbacks? One very common strategy is to use what Node.js adopted: the first parameter in any callback function is the error object: **error-first callbacks**

If there is no error, the object is `null`. If there is an error, it contains some description of the error and other information.

```js
//
fs.readFile('/file.json', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        //handle error

        console.log(err);

        return;
    }

    //no errors, process data

    console.log(data);
});
```

## The problem with callbacks

Callbacks are great for simple cases!

However every callback adds a level of nesting, and when you have lots of callbacks, the code starts to be complicated very quickly:

```js
//
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    document.getElementById('button').addEventListener('click', () => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            items.forEach((item) => {
                //your code here
            });
        }, 2000);
    });
});
```

This is just a simple 4-levels code, but I've seen much more levels of nesting and it's not fun.

How do we solve this?

## Alternatives to callbacks

Starting with ES6, JavaScript introduced several features that help us with asynchronous code that do not involve using callbacks: Promises (ES6) and Async/Await (ES2017).

# Understanding JavaScript Promises

description: 'Promises are one way to deal with asynchronous code in JavaScript, without writing too many callbacks in your code.'

## Introduction to promises

<iframe title="Introduction to promises" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/nodejs-dev-0006-01?index.js&zenmode=1&view=editor" alt="nodejs-dev-0006-01 on StackBlitz" style="height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;">
</iframe>
<br>

A promise is commonly defined as **a proxy for a value that will eventually become available**.

Promises are one way to deal with asynchronous code, without getting stuck in [callback hell](images/http://callbackhell.com/).

Promises have been part of the language for years (standardized and introduced in ES2015), and have recently become more integrated, with **async** and **await** in ES2017.

**Async functions** use promises behind the scenes, so understanding how promises work is fundamental to understanding how `async` and `await` work.

### How promises work, in brief

Once a promise has been called, it will start in a **pending state**. This means that the calling function continues executing, while the promise is pending until it resolves, giving the calling function whatever data was being requested.

The created promise will eventually end in a **resolved state**, or in a **rejected state**, calling the respective callback functions (passed to `then` and `catch`) upon finishing.

### Which JS APIs use promises?

In addition to your own code and libraries code, promises are used by standard modern Web APIs such as:

-   the Battery API
-
-   the Fetch API

-   Service Workers

It's unlikely that in modern JavaScript you'll find yourself _not_ using promises, so let's start diving right into them.

---

## Creating a promise

The Promise API exposes a Promise constructor, which you initialize using `new Promise()`:

```js
//
let done = true;

const isItDoneYet = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (done) {
        const workDone = 'Here is the thing I built';

        resolve(workDone);
    } else {
        const why = 'Still working on something else';

        reject(why);
    }
});
```

As you can see, the promise checks the `done` global constant, and if that's true, the promise goes to a **resolved** state (since the `resolve` callback was called); otherwise, the `reject` callback is executed, putting the promise in a rejected state. (If none of these functions is called in the execution path, the promise will remain in a pending state)

A more common example you may come across is a technique called **Promisifying**. This technique is a way to be able to use a classic JavaScript function that takes a callback, and have it return a promise:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

const getFile = (fileName) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        fs.readFile(fileName, (err, data) => {
            if (err) {
                reject(err); // calling `reject` will cause the promise to fail with or without the error passed as an argument

                return; // and we don't want to go any further
            }

            resolve(data);
        });
    });
};

getFile('/etc/passwd')
    .then((data) => console.log(data))

    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

> In recent versions of Node.js, you won't have to do this manual conversion for a lot of the API. There is a promisifying function available in the [util module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v11.x/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original) that will do this for you, given that the function you're promisifying has the correct signature.

---

## Consuming a promise

Now let's see how the promise can be _consumed_ or used.

```js
//
const isItDoneYet = new Promise(/* ... as above ... */);

//...

const checkIfItsDone = () => {
    isItDoneYet

        .then((ok) => {
            console.log(ok);
        })

        .catch((err) => {
            console.error(err);
        });
};
```

Running `checkIfItsDone()` will specify functions to execute when the `isItDoneYet` promise resolves (in the `then` call) or rejects (in the `catch` call).

---

## Chaining promises

A promise can be returned to another promise, creating a chain of promises.

A great example of chaining promises is the Fetch API, which we can use to get a resource and queue a chain of promises to execute when the resource is fetched.

The Fetch API is a promise-based mechanism, and calling `fetch()` is equivalent to defining our own promise using `new Promise()`.

### Example of chaining promises

```js
//
const status = (response) => {
    if (response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300) {
        return Promise.resolve(response);
    }

    return Promise.reject(new Error(response.statusText));
};

const json = (response) => response.json();

fetch('/todos.json')
    .then(status) // note that the `status` function is actually **called** here, and that it **returns a promise***

    .then(json) // likewise, the only difference here is that the `json` function here returns a promise that resolves with `data`

    .then((data) => {
        // ... which is why `data` shows up here as the first parameter to the anonymous function

        console.log('Request succeeded with JSON response', data);
    })

    .catch((error) => {
        console.log('Request failed', error);
    });
```

> <code>
> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch">node-fetch</a>
> </code> is minimal code for window.fetch compatible API on Node.js runtime.

In this example, we call `fetch()` to get a list of TODO items from the `todos.json` file found in the domain root, and we create a chain of promises.

Running `fetch()` returns a [response](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-response), which has many properties, and within those we reference:

-   `status`, a numeric value representing the HTTP status code
-
-   `statusText`, a status message, which is `OK` if the request succeeded

`response` also has a `json()` method, which returns a promise that will resolve with the content of the body processed and transformed into JSON.

So given those promises, this is what happens: the first promise in the chain is a function that we defined, called `status()`, that checks the response status and if it's not a success response (between 200 and 299), it rejects the promise.

This operation will cause the promise chain to skip all the chained promises listed and will skip directly to the `catch()` statement at the bottom, logging the `Request failed` text along with the error message.

If that succeeds instead, it calls the `json()` function we defined. Since the previous promise, when successful, returned the `response` object, we get it as an input to the second promise.

In this case, we return the data JSON processed, so the third promise receives the JSON directly:

```js
//

.then((data) => {

  console.log('Request succeeded with JSON response', data)

})

```

and we simply log it to the console.

---

## Handling errors

When anything in the chain of promises fails and raises an error or rejects the promise, the control goes to the nearest `catch()` statement down the chain.

```js
//
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    throw new Error('Error');
}).catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
});

// or

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    reject('Error');
}).catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
});
```

### Cascading errors

If inside the `catch()` you raise an error, you can append a second `catch()` to handle it, and so on.

```js
//
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    throw new Error('Error');
})

    .catch((err) => {
        throw new Error('Error');
    })

    .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

---

## Orchestrating promises

### `Promise.all()`

If you need to synchronize different promises, `Promise.all()` helps you define a list of promises, and execute something when they are all resolved.

Example:

```js
//
const f1 = fetch('/something.json');

const f2 = fetch('/something2.json');

Promise.all([f1, f2])

    .then((res) => {
        console.log('Array of results', res);
    })

    .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

The ES2015 destructuring assignment syntax allows you to also do

```js
//
Promise.all([f1, f2]).then(([res1, res2]) => {
    console.log('Results', res1, res2);
});
```

You are not limited to using `fetch` of course, **any promise can be used in this fashion**.

### `Promise.race()`

`Promise.race()` runs when the first of the promises you pass to it settles (resolves or rejects), and it runs the attached callback just once, with the result of the first promise settled.

Example:

```js
//
const first = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 500, 'first');
});

const second = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'second');
});

Promise.race([first, second]).then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // second
});
```

### `Promise.any()`

`Promise.any()` settles when any of the promises you pass to it fulfill or all of the promises get rejected. It returns a single promise that resolves with the value from the first promise that is fulfilled. If all promises are rejected, then the returned promise is rejected with an `AggregateError`.

Example:

```js
//
const first = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(reject, 500, 'first');
});

const second = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(reject, 100, 'second');
});

Promise.any([first, second]).catch((error) => {
    console.log(error); // AggregateError
});
```

## Common errors

### Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a promise

If you get the `Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a promise` error in the console, make sure you use `new Promise()` instead of just `Promise()`

### UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning

This means that a promise you called rejected, but there was no `catch` used to handle the error. Add a `catch` after the offending `then` to handle this properly.

# 'Modern Asynchronous JavaScript with Async and Await'

description: 'Discover the modern approach to asynchronous functions in JavaScript. JavaScript evolved in a very short time from callbacks to Promises, and since ES2017 asynchronous JavaScript is even simpler with the async/await syntax'

## Introduction

JavaScript evolved in a very short time from callbacks to promises (ES2015), and since ES2017 asynchronous JavaScript is even simpler with the async/await syntax.

Async functions are a combination of promises and generators, and basically, they are a higher level abstraction over promises. Let me repeat: **async/await is built on promises**.

## Why were async/await introduced?

They reduce the boilerplate around promises, and the "don't break the chain" limitation of chaining promises.

When Promises were introduced in ES2015, they were meant to solve a problem with asynchronous code, and they did, but over the 2 years that separated ES2015 and ES2017, it was clear that _promises could not be the ultimate solution_.

Promises were introduced to solve the famous _callback hell_ problem, but they introduced complexity on their own, and syntax complexity.

They were good primitives around which a better syntax could be exposed to the developers, so when the time was right we got **async functions**.

They make the code look like it's synchronous, but it's asynchronous and non-blocking behind the scenes.

## How it works

An async function returns a promise, like in this example:

```js
//
const doSomethingAsync = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve('I did something'), 3000);
    });
};
```

When you want to **call** this function you prepend `await`, and **the calling code will stop until the promise is resolved or rejected**. One caveat: the client function must be defined as `async`. Here's an example:

```js
//
const doSomething = async () => {
    console.log(await doSomethingAsync());
};
```

## A quick example

This is a simple example of async/await used to run a function asynchronously:

<iframe title="Modern Asynchronous JavaScript with Async and Await" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/nodejs-dev-0007-01?index.js&zenmode=1&view=editor" alt="nodejs-dev-0007-01 on StackBlitz" style="height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;">
</iframe>
<br>

```js
//
const doSomethingAsync = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve('I did something'), 3000);
    });
};

const doSomething = async () => {
    console.log(await doSomethingAsync());
};

console.log('Before');

doSomething();

console.log('After');
```

The above code will print the following to the browser console:

```

Before

After

I did something //after 3s

```-->

## Promise all the things

Prepending the `async` keyword to any function means that the function will return a promise.

Even if it's not doing so explicitly, it will internally make it return a promise.

This is why this code is valid:

```js
//
const aFunction = async () => {
    return 'test';
};

aFunction().then(alert); // This will alert 'test'
```

and it's the same as:

```js
//
const aFunction = () => {
    return Promise.resolve('test');
};

aFunction().then(alert); // This will alert 'test'
```

## The code is much simpler to read

As you can see in the example above, our code looks very simple. Compare it to code using plain promises, with chaining and callback functions.

And this is a very simple example, the major benefits will arise when the code is much more complex.

For example here's how you would get a JSON resource, and parse it, using promises:

```js
//
const getFirstUserData = () => {
    return fetch('/users.json') // get users list
        .then((response) => response.json()) // parse JSON

        .then((users) => users[0]) // pick first user

        .then((user) => fetch(`/users/${user.name}`)) // get user data

        .then((userResponse) => userResponse.json()); // parse JSON
};

getFirstUserData();
```

And here is the same functionality provided using await/async:

```js
//
const getFirstUserData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/users.json'); // get users list

    const users = await response.json(); // parse JSON

    const user = users[0]; // pick first user

    const userResponse = await fetch(`/users/${user.name}`); // get user data

    const userData = await userResponse.json(); // parse JSON

    return userData;
};

getFirstUserData();
```

## Multiple async functions in series

Async functions can be chained very easily, and the syntax is much more readable than with plain promises:

<iframe title="Multiple async functions in series" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/nodejs-dev-0008-01?index.js&zenmode=1&view=editor" alt="nodejs-dev-0008-01 on StackBlitz" style="height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;">
</iframe>
<br>

```js
//
const promiseToDoSomething = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve('I did something'), 10000);
    });
};

const watchOverSomeoneDoingSomething = async () => {
    const something = await promiseToDoSomething();

    return something + ' and I watched';
};

const watchOverSomeoneWatchingSomeoneDoingSomething = async () => {
    const something = await watchOverSomeoneDoingSomething();

    return something + ' and I watched as well';
};

watchOverSomeoneWatchingSomeoneDoingSomething().then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
});
```

Will print:

```

I did something and I watched and I watched as well

```-->

## Easier debugging

Debugging promises is hard because the debugger will not step over asynchronous code.

Async/await makes this very easy because to the compiler it's just like synchronous code.

# The Node.js Event emitter

description: 'How to work with custom events in Node.js'

If you worked with JavaScript in the browser, you know how much of the interaction of the user is handled through events: mouse clicks, keyboard button presses, reacting to mouse movements, and so on.

On the backend side, Node.js offers us the option to build a similar system using the [`events` module](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html).

This module, in particular, offers the `EventEmitter` class, which we'll use to handle our events.

You initialize that using

```js
//
const EventEmitter = require('events');

const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
```

This object exposes, among many others, the `on` and `emit` methods.

-   `emit` is used to trigger an event
-
-   `on` is used to add a callback function that's going to be executed when the event is triggered

For example, let's create a `start` event, and as a matter of providing a sample, we react to that by just logging to the console:

```js
//
eventEmitter.on('start', () => {
    console.log('started');
});
```

When we run

```js
//
eventEmitter.emit('start');
```

the event handler function is triggered, and we get the console log.

You can pass arguments to the event handler by passing them as additional arguments to `emit()`:

```js
//
eventEmitter.on('start', (number) => {
    console.log(`started ${number}`);
});

eventEmitter.emit('start', 23);
```

Multiple arguments:

```js
//
eventEmitter.on('start', (start, end) => {
    console.log(`started from ${start} to ${end}`);
});

eventEmitter.emit('start', 1, 100);
```

The EventEmitter object also exposes several other methods to interact with events, like

-   `once()`: add a one-time listener
-
-   `removeListener()` / `off()`: remove an event listener from an event

-   `removeAllListeners()`: remove all listeners for an event

You can read all their details on the events module page at <https://nodejs.org/api/events.html>

# 'Build an HTTP Server'

description: 'How to build an HTTP server with Node.js'

Here is a sample Hello World HTTP web server:

<iframe title="Build an HTTP Server" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/nodejs-dev-0009-01?index.js&zenmode=1" alt="nodejs-dev-0009-01 on StackBlitz" style="height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;">
</iframe>
<br>

```js
//

const http = require('http')

const port = process.env.PORT

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {

  res.statusCode = 200

  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html')

  res.end('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>')

})

server.listen(port, () => {

  console.log(`Server running at port ${port}`)

})

```-->

Let's analyze it briefly. We include the [`http` module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html).

We use the module to create an HTTP server.

The server is set to listen on the specified port, `3000`. When the server is ready, the `listen` callback function is called.

The callback function we pass is the one that's going to be executed upon every request that comes in. Whenever a new request is received, the [`request` event](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request) is called, providing two objects: a request (an [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) object) and a response (an [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) object).

`request` provides the request details. Through it, we access the request headers and request data.

`response` is used to populate the data we're going to return to the client.

In this case with

```js
//
res.statusCode = 200;
```

we set the statusCode property to 200, to indicate a successful response.

We also set the Content-Type header:

```js
//
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html');
```

and we end close the response, adding the content as an argument to `end()`:

```js
//
res.end('<h1>Hello, World!</h1>');
```

# 'Making HTTP requests with Node.js'

description: 'How to perform HTTP requests with Node.js using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE'

## Perform a GET Request

```js
//
const https = require('https');

const options = {
    hostname: 'example.com',

    port: 443,

    path: '/todos',

    method: 'GET'
};

const req = https.request(options, (res) => {
    console.log(`statusCode: ${res.statusCode}`);

    res.on('data', (d) => {
        process.stdout.write(d);
    });
});

req.on('error', (error) => {
    console.error(error);
});

req.end();
```

## Perform a POST Request

```js
//
const https = require('https');

const data = new TextEncoder().encode(
    JSON.stringify({
        todo: 'Buy the milk 🍼'
    })
);

const options = {
    hostname: 'whatever.com',

    port: 443,

    path: '/todos',

    method: 'POST',

    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',

        'Content-Length': data.length
    }
};

const req = https.request(options, (res) => {
    console.log(`statusCode: ${res.statusCode}`);

    res.on('data', (d) => {
        process.stdout.write(d);
    });
});

req.on('error', (error) => {
    console.error(error);
});

req.write(data);

req.end();
```

## PUT and DELETE

PUT and DELETE requests use the same POST request format - you just need to change the `options.method` value to the appropriate method.

# Make an HTTP POST request using Node.js

description: 'Find out how to make an HTTP POST request using Node.js'

There are many ways to perform an HTTP POST request in Node.js, depending on the abstraction level you want to use.

The simplest way to perform an HTTP request using Node.js is to use the [Axios library](https://github.com/axios/axios):

```js
//
const axios = require('axios');

axios

    .post('https://whatever.com/todos', {
        todo: 'Buy the milk'
    })

    .then((res) => {
        console.log(`statusCode: ${res.status}`);

        console.log(res);
    })

    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

Axios requires the use of a 3rd party library.

A POST request is possible just using the Node.js standard modules, although it's more verbose than the two preceding options:

```js
//
const https = require('https');

const data = JSON.stringify({
    todo: 'Buy the milk'
});

const options = {
    hostname: 'whatever.com',

    port: 443,

    path: '/todos',

    method: 'POST',

    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',

        'Content-Length': data.length
    }
};

const req = https.request(options, (res) => {
    console.log(`statusCode: ${res.statusCode}`);

    res.on('data', (d) => {
        process.stdout.write(d);
    });
});

req.on('error', (error) => {
    console.error(error);
});

req.write(data);

req.end();
```

# Get HTTP request body data using Node.js

description: 'Find out how to extract the data sent as JSON through an HTTP request body using Node.js'

Here is how you can extract the data that was sent as JSON in the request body.

If you are using Express, that's quite simple: use the `body-parser` Node.js module.

For example, to get the body of this request:

```js
//
const axios = require('axios');

axios.post('https://whatever.com/todos', {
    todo: 'Buy the milk'
});
```

This is the matching server-side code:

```js
//
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.use(
    express.urlencoded({
        extended: true
    })
);

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/todos', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.body.todo);
});
```

If you're not using Express and you want to do this in vanilla Node.js, you need to do a bit more work, of course, as Express abstracts a lot of this for you.

The key thing to understand is that when you initialize the HTTP server using `http.createServer()`, the callback is called when the server got all the HTTP headers, but not the request body.

The `request` object passed in the connection callback is a stream.

So, we must listen for the body content to be processed, and it's processed in chunks.

We first get the data by listening to the stream `data` events, and when the data ends, the stream `end` event is called, once:

```js
//
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    // we can access HTTP headers

    req.on('data', (chunk) => {
        console.log(`Data chunk available: ${chunk}`);
    });

    req.on('end', () => {
        //end of data
    });
});
```

So to access the data, assuming we expect to receive a string, we must concatenate the chunks into a string when listening to the stream `data`, and when the stream `end`, we parse the string to JSON:

```js
//
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    let data = '';

    req.on('data', (chunk) => {
        data += chunk;
    });

    req.on('end', () => {
        console.log(JSON.parse(data).todo); // 'Buy the milk'

        res.end();
    });
});
```

Starting from Node.js v10 a `for await .. of` syntax is available for use. It simplifies the example above and makes it look more linear:

```js
//
const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
    const buffers = [];

    for await (const chunk of req) {
        buffers.push(chunk);
    }

    const data = Buffer.concat(buffers).toString();

    console.log(JSON.parse(data).todo); // 'Buy the milk'

    res.end();
});
```

# How to install Node.js

description: 'How you can install Node.js on your system: a package manager, the official website installer or nvm'

Node.js can be installed in different ways. This post highlights the most common and convenient ones.

Official packages for all the major platforms are available at <https://nodejs.dev/download/>.

One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package manager. In this case, every operating system has its own.

Other package managers for MacOS, Linux, and Windows are listed in <https://nodejs.dev/download/package-manager/>

`nvm` is a popular way to run Node.js. It allows you to easily switch the Node.js version, and install new versions to try and easily rollback if something breaks, for example.

It is also very useful to test your code with old Node.js versions.

See <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm> for more information about this option.

In any case, when Node.js is installed you'll have access to the `node` executable program in the command line.

# 'Working with file descriptors in Node.js'

description: 'How to interact with file descriptors using Node.js'

Before you're able to interact with a file that sits in your filesystem, you must get a file descriptor.

A file descriptor is a reference to an open file, a number (fd) returned by opening the file using the `open()` method offered by the `fs` module. This number (`fd`) uniquely identifies an open file in operating system:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

fs.open('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r', (err, fd) => {
    //fd is our file descriptor
});
```

Notice the `r` we used as the second parameter to the `fs.open()` call.

That flag means we open the file for reading.

Other flags you'll commonly use are

-   `r+` open the file for reading and writing, if file don't exist it won't be created.
-
-   `w+` open the file for reading and writing, positioning the stream at the beginning of the file. The file is create
-
-   `a` open the file for writing, positioning the stream at the end of the file. The file is created if not existing

-   `a+` open the file for reading and writing, positioning the stream at the end of the file. The file is created if not existing

You can also open the file by using the `fs.openSync` method, which returns the file descriptor, instead of providing it in a callback:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

try {
    const fd = fs.openSync('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'r');
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
}
```

Once you get the file descriptor, in whatever way you choose, you can perform all the operations that require it, like calling `fs.close()` and many other operations that interact with the filesystem.

# 'Node.js file stats'

description: 'How to get the details of a file using Node.js'

Every file comes with a set of details that we can inspect using Node.js.

In particular, using the `stat()` method provided by the `fs` module.

You call it passing a file path, and once Node.js gets the file details it will call the callback function you pass, with 2 parameters: an error message, and the file stats:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

fs.stat('/Users/joe/test.txt', (err, stats) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);

        return;
    }

    //we have access to the file stats in `stats`
});
```

Node.js provides also a sync method, which blocks the thread until the file stats are ready:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

try {
    const stats = fs.statSync('/Users/joe/test.txt');
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
}
```

The file information is included in the stats variable. What kind of information can we extract using the stats?

A lot, including:

-   if the file is a directory or a file, using `stats.isFile()` and `stats.isDirectory()`
-
-   if the file is a symbolic link using `stats.isSymbolicLink()`

-   the file size in bytes using `stats.size`.

There are other advanced methods, but the bulk of what you'll use in your day-to-day programming is this.

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

fs.stat('/Users/joe/test.txt', (err, stats) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);

        return;
    }

    stats.isFile(); //true

    stats.isDirectory(); //false

    stats.isSymbolicLink(); //false

    stats.size; //1024000 //= 1MB
});
```

# 'Node.js File Paths'

description: 'How to interact with file paths and manipulate them in Node.js'

Every file in the system has a path.

On Linux and macOS, a path might look like:

`/users/joe/file.txt`

while Windows computers are different, and have a structure such as:

`C:\users\joe\file.txt`

You need to pay attention when using paths in your applications, as this difference must be taken into account.

You include this module in your files using

```js
//
const path = require('path');
```

and you can start using its methods.

## Getting information out of a path

Given a path, you can extract information out of it using those methods:

-   `dirname`: get the parent folder of a file
-
-   `basename`: get the filename part

-   `extname`: get the file extension

Example:

```js
//
const notes = '/users/joe/notes.txt';

path.dirname(notes); // /users/joe

path.basename(notes); // notes.txt

path.extname(notes); // .txt
```

You can get the file name without the extension by specifying a second argument to `basename`:

```js
//
path.basename(notes, path.extname(notes)); //notes
```

## Working with paths

You can join two or more parts of a path by using `path.join()`:

```js
//
const name = 'joe';

path.join('/', 'users', name, 'notes.txt'); //'/users/joe/notes.txt'
```

You can get the absolute path calculation of a relative path using `path.resolve()`:

```js
//
path.resolve('joe.txt'); //'/Users/joe/joe.txt' if run from my home folder
```

In this case Node.js will simply append `/joe.txt` to the current working directory. If you specify a second parameter folder, `resolve` will use the first as a base for the second:

```js
//
path.resolve('tmp', 'joe.txt'); //'/Users/joe/tmp/joe.txt' if run from my home folder
```

If the first parameter starts with a slash, that means it's an absolute path:

```js
//
path.resolve('/etc', 'joe.txt'); //'/etc/joe.txt'
```

`path.normalize()` is another useful function, that will try and calculate the actual path, when it contains relative specifiers like `.` or `..`, or double slashes:

```js
//
path.normalize('/users/joe/..//test.txt'); //'/users/test.txt'
```

**Neither resolve nor normalize will check if the path exists**. They just calculate a path based on the information they got.

# 'Reading files with Node.js'

description: 'How to read files using Node.js'

The simplest way to read a file in Node.js is to use the `fs.readFile()` method, passing it the file path, encoding and a callback function that will be called with the file data (and the error):

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);

        return;
    }

    console.log(data);
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the synchronous version `fs.readFileSync()`:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

try {
    const data = fs.readFileSync('/Users/joe/test.txt', 'utf8');

    console.log(data);
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
}
```

Both `fs.readFile()` and `fs.readFileSync()` read the full content of the file in memory before returning the data.

This means that big files are going to have a major impact on your memory consumption and speed of execution of the program.

In this case, a better option is to read the file content using streams.

# 'Writing files with Node.js'

description: 'How to write files using Node.js'

The easiest way to write to files in Node.js is to use the `fs.writeFile()` API.

Example:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

const content = 'Some content!';

fs.writeFile('/Users/joe/test.txt', content, (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);

        return;
    }

    //file written successfully
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the synchronous version `fs.writeFileSync()`:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

const content = 'Some content!';

try {
    const data = fs.writeFileSync('/Users/joe/test.txt', content);

    //file written successfully
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
}
```

By default, this API will **replace the contents of the file** if it does already exist.

You can modify the default by specifying a flag:

```js
//
fs.writeFile('/Users/joe/test.txt', content, { flag: 'a+' }, (err) => {});
```

The flags you'll likely use are

-   `r+` open the file for reading and writing
-
-   `w+` open the file for reading and writing, positioning the stream at the beginning of the file. The file is created if
-
-   `a` open the file for writing, positioning the stream at the end of the file. The file is created if it does not exist

-   `a+` open the file for reading and writing, positioning the stream at the end of the file. The file is created if it does not exist

(you can find more flags at <https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system_flags>)

## Append to a file

A handy method to append content to the end of a file is `fs.appendFile()` (and its `fs.appendFileSync()` counterpart):

```js
//
const content = 'Some content!';

fs.appendFile('file.log', content, (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);

        return;
    }

    //done!
});
```

## Using streams

All those methods write the full content to the file before returning the control back to your program (in the async version, this means executing the callback)

In this case, a better option is to write the file content using streams.

# 'Working with folders in Node.js'

description: 'How to interact with folders using Node.js'

The Node.js `fs` core module provides many handy methods you can use to work with folders.

## Check if a folder exists

Use `fs.access()` to check if the folder exists and Node.js can access it with its permissions.

## Create a new folder

Use `fs.mkdir()` or `fs.mkdirSync()` to create a new folder.

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

const folderName = '/Users/joe/test';

try {
    if (!fs.existsSync(folderName)) {
        fs.mkdirSync(folderName);
    }
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
}
```

## Read the content of a directory

Use `fs.readdir()` or `fs.readdirSync()` to read the contents of a directory.

This piece of code reads the content of a folder, both files and subfolders, and returns their relative path:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

const folderPath = '/Users/joe';

fs.readdirSync(folderPath);
```

You can get the full path:

```js
//
fs.readdirSync(folderPath).map((fileName) => {
    return path.join(folderPath, fileName);
});
```

You can also filter the results to only return the files, and exclude the folders:

```js
//
const isFile = (fileName) => {
    return fs.lstatSync(fileName).isFile();
};

fs.readdirSync(folderPath)
    .map((fileName) => {
        return path.join(folderPath, fileName);
    })

    .filter(isFile);
```

## Rename a folder

Use `fs.rename()` or `fs.renameSync()` to rename folder. The first parameter is the current path, the second the new path:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

fs.rename('/Users/joe', '/Users/roger', (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);

        return;
    }

    //done
});
```

`fs.renameSync()` is the synchronous version:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

try {
    fs.renameSync('/Users/joe', '/Users/roger');
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
}
```

## Remove a folder

Use `fs.rmdir()` or `fs.rmdirSync()` to remove a folder.

Removing a folder that has content can be more complicated than you need. You can pass the option `{ recursive: true }` to recursively remove the contents.

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

fs.rmdir(dir, { recursive: true }, (err) => {
    if (err) {
        throw err;
    }

    console.log(`${dir} is deleted!`);
});
```

> **NOTE:** In Node `v16.x` the option `recursive` is **deprecated** for `fs.rmdir` of callback API, instead use `fs.rm` to delete folders that have content in them:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

fs.rm(dir, { recursive: true, force: true }, (err) => {
    if (err) {
        throw err;
    }

    console.log(`${dir} is deleted!`);
});
```

Or you can install and make use of the [`fs-extra`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) module, which is very popular and well maintained. It's a drop-in replacement of the `fs` module, which provides more features on top of it.

In this case the `remove()` method is what you want.

Install it using

```bash

npm install fs-extra

```

and use it like this:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs-extra');

const folder = '/Users/joe';

fs.remove(folder, (err) => {
    console.error(err);
});
```

It can also be used with promises:

```js
//
fs.remove(folder)

    .then(() => {
        //done
    })

    .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err);
    });
```

or with async/await:

```js
//
async function removeFolder(folder) {
    try {
        await fs.remove(folder);

        //done
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
}

const folder = '/Users/joe';

removeFolder(folder);
```

# 'The Node.js fs module'

description: 'The fs module of Node.js provides useful functions to interact with the file system'

The `fs` module provides a lot of very useful functionality to access and interact with the file system.

There is no need to install it. Being part of the Node.js core, it can be used by simply requiring it:

-   `fs.utimes()`: change the timestamp of the file identified by the filename passed. Related: `fs.futimes()`

-   `fs.watchFile()`: start watching for changes on a file. Related: `fs.watch()`

-   `fs.writeFile()`: write data to a file. Related: `fs.write()`

One peculiar thing about the `fs` module is that all the methods are asynchronous by default, but they can also work synchronously by appending `Sync`.

For example:

-   `fs.rename()`
-
-   `fs.renameSync
-
-   `fs.write()`

-   `fs.writeSync()`

This makes a huge difference in your application flow.

> Node.js 10 includes [experimental support](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_promises_api) for a promise based API

For example let's examine the `fs.rename()` method. The asynchronous API is used with a callback:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

fs.rename('before.json', 'after.json', (err) => {
    if (err) {
        return console.error(err);
    }

    //done
});
```

A synchronous API can be used like this, with a try/catch block to handle errors:

```js
//
const fs = require('fs');

try {
    fs.renameSync('before.json', 'after.json');

    //done
} catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
}
```

The key difference here is that the execution of your script will block in the second example, until the file operation succeeded.

# 'The Node.js path module'

description: 'The path module of Node.js provides useful functions to interact with file paths'

The `path` module provides a lot of very useful functionality to access and interact with the file system.

There is no need to install it. Being part of the Node.js core, it can be used by simply requiring it:

```js
//
const path = require('path');
```

This module provides `path.sep` which provides the path segment separator (`\` on Windows, and `/` on Linux / macOS), and `path.delimiter` which provides the path delimiter (`;` on Windows, and `:` on Linux / macOS).

These are the `path` methods:

### `path.basename()`

Return the last portion of a path. A second parameter can filter out the file extension:

```js
//
require('path').basename('/test/something'); //something

require('path').basename('/test/something.txt'); //something.txt

require('path').basename('/test/something.txt', '.txt'); //something
```

### `path.dirname()`

Return the directory part of a path:

```js
//
require('path').dirname('/test/something'); // /test

require('path').dirname('/test/something/file.txt'); // /test/something
```

### `path.extname()`

Return the extension part of a path

```js
//
require('path').extname('/test/something'); // ''

require('path').extname('/test/something/file.txt'); // '.txt'
```

### `path.format()`

Returns a path string from an object, This is the opposite of `path.parse`<br/>

`path.format` accepts an object as argument with the follwing keys:

-   `root`: the root
-
-   `dir`: the folder path starting fro
-
-   `base`: the file name + extension

-   `name`: the file name

-   `ext`: the file extension

`root` is ignored if `dir` is provided<br/>

`ext` and `name` are ignored if `base` exists

```js
//
// POSIX

require('path').format({ dir: '/Users/joe', base: 'test.txt' }); //  '/Users/joe/test.txt'

require('path').format({ root: '/Users/joe', name: 'test', ext: 'txt' }); //  '/Users/joe/test.txt'

// WINDOWS

require('path').format({ dir: 'C:\\Users\\joe', base: 'test.txt' }); //  'C:\\Users\\joe\\test.txt'
```

### `path.isAbsolute()`

Returns true if it's an absolute path

```js
//
require('path').isAbsolute('/test/something'); // true

require('path').isAbsolute('./test/something'); // false
```

### `path.join()`

Joins two or more parts of a path:

```js
//
const name = 'joe';

require('path').join('/', 'users', name, 'notes.txt'); //'/users/joe/notes.txt'
```

### `path.normalize()`

Tries to calculate the actual path when it contains relative specifiers like `.` or `..`, or double slashes:

```js
//
require('path').normalize('/users/joe/..//test.txt'); //'/users/test.txt'
```

### `path.parse()`

Parses a path to an object with the segments that compose it:

-   `root`: the root
-
-   `dir`: the folder path starting fro
-
-   `base`: the file name + extension

-   `name`: the file name

-   `ext`: the file extension

Example:

```js
//
require('path').parse('/users/test.txt');
```

results in

```js
//

{

  root: '/',

  dir: '/users',

  base: 'test.txt',

  ext: '.txt',

  name: 'test'

}

```

### `path.relative()`

Accepts 2 paths as arguments. Returns the relative path from the first path to the second, based on the current working directory.

Example:

```js
//
require('path').relative('/Users/joe', '/Users/joe/test.txt'); //'test.txt'

require('path').relative('/Users/joe', '/Users/joe/something/test.txt'); //'something/test.txt'
```

### `path.resolve()`

You can get the absolute path calculation of a relative path using `path.resolve()`:

```js
//
path.resolve('joe.txt'); //'/Users/joe/joe.txt' if run from my home folder
```

By specifying a second parameter, `resolve` will use the first as a base for the second:

```js
//
path.resolve('tmp', 'joe.txt'); //'/Users/joe/tmp/joe.txt' if run from my home folder
```

If the first parameter starts with a slash, that means it's an absolute path:

```js
//
path.resolve('/etc', 'joe.txt'); //'/etc/joe.txt'
```

# 'The Node.js os module'

description: 'The os module of Node.js provides useful functions to interact with underlying system'

This module provides many functions that you can use to retrieve information from the underlying operating system and the computer the program runs on, and interact with it.

```js
//
const os = require('os');
```

There are a few useful properties that tell us some key things related to handling files:

`os.EOL` gives the line delimiter sequence. It's `\n` on Linux and macOS, and `\r\n` on Windows.

`os.constants.signals` tells us all the constants related to handling process signals, like SIGHUP, SIGKILL and so on.

`os.constants.errno` sets the constants for error reporting, like EADDRINUSE, EOVERFLOW and more.

You can read them all on <https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_signal_constants>.

Let's now see the main methods that `os` provides:

## `os.arch()`

Return the string that identifies the underlying architecture, like `arm`, `x64`, `arm64`.

## `os.cpus()`

Return information on the CPUs available on your system.

            sys: 187986530,

            idle: 685833750,

            irq: 0
        }
    },

    {
        model: 'Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     P8600  @ 2.40GHz',

        speed: 2400,

        times: {
            user: 282348700,

            nice: 0,

            sys: 161800480,

            idle: 703509470,

            irq: 0
        }
    }
];
```

## `os.endianness()`

# 'The Node.js events module'

description: 'The events module of Node.js provides the EventEmitter class'

The `events` module provides us the EventEmitter class, which is key to working with events in Node.js.

```js
//
const EventEmitter = require('events');

const door = new EventEmitter();
```

The event listener has these in-built events:

-   `newListener` when a listener is added
-
-   `removeListener` when a listener is removed

Here's a detailed description of the most useful methods:

## `emitter.addListener()`

Alias for `emitter.on()`.

## `emitter.emit()`

Emits an event. It synchronously calls every event listener in the order they were registered.

```js
//
door.emit('slam'); // emitting the event "slam"
```

## `emitter.eventNames()`

Return an array of strings that represent the events registered on the current `EventEmitter` object:

```js
//
door.eventNames();
```

## `emitter.getMaxListeners()`

Get the maximum amount of listeners one can add to an `EventEmitter` object, which defaults to 10 but can be increased or lowered by using `setMaxListeners()`

```js
//
door.getMaxListeners();
```

## `emitter.listenerCount()`

Get the count of listeners of the event passed as parameter:

```js
//
door.listenerCount('open');
```

## `emitter.listeners()`

Gets an array of listeners of the event passed as parameter:

```js
//
door.listeners('open');
```

## `emitter.off()`

Alias for `emitter.removeListener()` added in Node.js 10

## `emitter.on()`

Adds a callback function that's called when an event is emitted.

Usage:

```js
//
door.on('open', () => {
    console.log('Door was opened');
});
```

## `emitter.once()`

Adds a callback function that's called when an event is emitted for the first time after registering this. This callback is only going to be called once, never again.

```js
//
const EventEmitter = require('events');

const ee = new EventEmitter();

ee.once('my-event', () => {
    //call callback function once
});
```

## `emitter.prependListener()`

When you add a listener using `on` or `addListener`, it's added last in the queue of listeners, and called last. Using `prependListener` it's added, and called, before other listeners.

## `emitter.prependOnceListener()`

When you add a listener using `once`, it's added last in the queue of listeners, and called last. Using `prependOnceListener` it's added, and called, before other listeners.

## `emitter.removeAllListeners()`

Removes all listeners of an `EventEmitter` object listening to a specific event:

```js
//
door.removeAllListeners('open');
```

## `emitter.removeListener()`

Remove a specific listener. You can do this by saving the callback function to a variable, when added, so you can reference it later:

```js
//
const doSomething = () => {};

door.on('open', doSomething);

door.removeListener('open', doSomething);
```

## `emitter.setMaxListeners()`

Sets the maximum amount of listeners one can add to an `EventEmitter` object, which defaults to 10 but can be increased or lowered.

```js
//
door.setMaxListeners(50);
```

# How much JavaScript do you need to know to use Node.js?

description: 'If you are just starting out with JavaScript, how deeply do you need to know the language?'

As a beginner, it's hard to get to a point where you are confident enough in your programming abilities.

While learning to code, you might also be confused at where does JavaScript end, and where Node.js begins, and vice versa.

I would recommend you to have a good grasp of the main JavaScript concepts before diving into Node.js:

-   Lexical Structure
-
-   Express
-
-   Types
-
-   Classe
-
-   Variabl
-
-   Function
-
-   this
-
-   Arrow Functions

-   Loops

-   Scopes

-   Arrays

-   Template Literals

-   Semicolons

-   Strict Mode

-   ECMAScript 6, 2016, 2017

With those concepts in mind, you are well on your road to become a proficient JavaScript developer, in both the browser and in Node.js.

The following concepts are also key to understand asynchronous programming, which is one fundamental part of Node.js:

-   [Asynchronous programming and callbacks](https://nodejs.dev/learn/javascript-asynchronous-programming-and-callbacks)
-
-   [Timers](https://nodejs.dev/learn/discover-javascript-timers)
-
-   [Promises]
-
-   [Async and Await](https://nodejs.dev/learn/modern-asynchronous-javascript-with-async-and-await)

-   Closures

```

### `http.globalAgent`

Points to the global instance of the Agent object, which is an instance of the `http.Agent` class.

It's used to manage connections persistence and reuse for HTTP clients, and it's a key component of Node.js HTTP networking.

More in the `http.Agent` class description later on.

## Methods

### `http.createServer()`

Return a new instance of the `http.Server` class.

Usage:

```js
//
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    //handle every single request with this callback
});
```

### `http.request()`

Makes an HTTP request to a server, creating an instance of the `http.ClientRequest` class.

### `http.get()`

Similar to `http.request()`, but automatically sets the HTTP method to GET, and calls `req.end()` automatically.

## Classes

The HTTP module provides 5 classes:

-   `http.Agent`
-
-   `http.ClientReq
-
-   `http.Server`

-   `http.ServerResponse`

-   `http.IncomingMessage`

### `http.Agent`

Node.js creates a global instance of the `http.Agent` class to manage connections persistence and reuse for HTTP clients, a key component of Node.js HTTP networking.

This object makes sure that every request made to a server is queued and a single socket is reused.

It also maintains a pool of sockets. This is key for performance reasons.

### `http.ClientRequest`

An `http.ClientRequest` object is created when `http.request()` or `http.get()` is called.

When a response is received, the `response` event is called with the response, with an `http.IncomingMessage` instance as argument.

The returned data of a response can be read in 2 ways:

-   you can call the `response.read()` method
-
-   in the `response` event handler you can setup an event listener for the `data` event, so you can listen for the data streamed into.

### `http.Server`

This class is commonly instantiated and returned when creating a new server using `http.createServer()`.

Once you have a server object, you have access to its methods:

-   `close()` stops the server from accepting new connections
-
-   `listen()` starts the HTTP server and listens for connections

### `http.ServerResponse`

Created by an `http.Server` and passed as the second parameter to the `request` event it fires.

Commonly known and used in code as `res`:

```js
//
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    //res is an http.ServerResponse object
});
```

The method you'll always call in the handler is `end()`, which closes the response, the message is complete and the server can send it to the client. It must be called on each response.

These methods are used to interact with HTTP headers:

-   `getHeaderNames()` get the list of the names of the HTTP headers already set
-
-   `getHeaders()` get a copy of the HTTP headers already set
-
-   `setHeader('headername', value)` sets an HTTP header value
-
-   `getHeader('headername')` gets an HTTP header already set

-   `removeHeader('headername')` removes an HTTP header already set

-   `hasHeader('headername')` return true if the response has that header set

-   `headersSent()` return true if the headers have already been sent to the client

After processing the headers you can send them to the client by calling `response.writeHead()`, which accepts the statusCode as the first parameter, the optional status message, and the headers object.

To send data to the client in the response body, you use `write()`. It will send buffered data to the HTTP response stream.

If the headers were not sent yet using `response.writeHead()`, it will send the headers first, with the status code and message that's set in the request, which you can edit by setting the `statusCode` and `statusMessage` properties values:

```js
//
response.statusCode = 500;

response.statusMessage = 'Internal Server Error';
```

### `http.IncomingMessage`

An `http.IncomingMessage` object is created by:

-   `http.Server` when listening to the `request` event
-
-   `http.ClientRequest` when listening to the `response` event

It can be used to access the response:

-   status using its `statusCode` and `statusMessage` methods
-
-   headers using its `headers` method or `
-
-   HTTP method using its `metho
-
-   HTTP version using the `httpVersion` method

-   URL using the `url` method

-   underlying socket using the `socket` method

The data is accessed using streams, since `http.IncomingMessage` implements the Readable Stream interface.

# Node.js Buffers

description: 'Learn what Node.js buffers are, what they are used for, how to use them'

## What is a buffer?

A buffer is an area of memory. Most JavaScript developers are much less familiar with this concept, compared to programmers using a system programming languages (like C, C++, or Go), which interact directly with memory every day.

It represents a fixed-size chunk of memory (can't be resized) allocated outside of the V8 JavaScript engine.

You can think of a buffer like an array of integers, which each represent a byte of data.

It is implemented by the Node.js [Buffer class](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html).

## Why do we need a buffer?

Buffers were introduced to help developers deal with binary data, in an ecosystem that traditionally only dealt with strings rather than binaries.

Buffers in Node.js are not related to the concept of buffering data. That is what happens when a stream processor receives data faster than it can digest.

## How to create a buffer

A buffer is created using the [`Buffer.from()`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer_from_buffer_alloc_and_buffer_allocunsafe), [`Buffer.alloc()`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_alloc_size_fill_encoding), and [`Buffer.allocUnsafe()`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_allocunsafe_size) methods.

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');
```

-   [`Buffer.from(array)`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_array)
-
-   [`Buffer.from(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset[, length]])`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class
-
-   [`Buffer.from(buffer)`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_buffer)

-   [`Buffer.from(string[, encoding])`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_string_encoding)

You can also just initialize the buffer passing the size. This creates a 1KB buffer:

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.alloc(1024);

//or

const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(1024);
```

While both `alloc` and `allocUnsafe` allocate a `Buffer` of the specified size in bytes, the `Buffer` created by `alloc` will be _initialized_ with zeroes and the one created by `allocUnsafe` will be _uninitialized_. This means that while `allocUnsafe` would be quite fast in comparison to `alloc`, the allocated segment of memory may contain old data which could potentially be sensitive.

Older data, if present in the memory, can be accessed or leaked when the `Buffer` memory is read. This is what really makes `allocUnsafe` unsafe and extra care must be taken while using it.

## Using a buffer

### Access the content of a buffer

A buffer, being an array of bytes, can be accessed like an array:

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');

console.log(buf[0]); //72

console.log(buf[1]); //101

console.log(buf[2]); //121
```

Those numbers are the UTF-8 bytes that identify the characters in the buffer (`H` → `72`, `e` → `101`, `y` → `121`). This happens because `Buffer.from()` uses UTF-8 by default.

Keep in mind that some characters may occupy more than one byte in the buffer (`é` → `195 169`).

You can print the full content of the buffer using the `toString()` method:

```js
//
console.log(buf.toString());
```

`buf.toString()` also uses UTF-8 by default.

> Notice that if you initialize a buffer with a number that sets its size, you'll get access to pre-initialized memory that will contain random data, not an empty buffer!

### Get the length of a buffer

Use the `length` property:

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');

console.log(buf.length);
```

### Iterate over the contents of a buffer

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');

for (const item of buf) {
    console.log(item); //72 101 121 33
}
```

### Changing the content of a buffer

You can write to a buffer a whole string of data by using the `write()` method:

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.alloc(4);

buf.write('Hey!');
```

Just like you can access a buffer with an array syntax, you can also set the contents of the buffer in the same way:

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');

buf[1] = 111; //o in UTF-8

console.log(buf.toString()); //Hoy!
```

### Slice a buffer

If you want to create a partial visualization of a buffer, you can create a slice. A slice is not a copy: the original buffer is still the source of truth. If that changes, your slice changes.

Use the `subarray()` method to create it. The first parameter is the starting position, and you can specify an optional second parameter with the end position:

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');

buf.subarray(0).toString(); //Hey!

const slice = buf.subarray(0, 2);

console.log(slice.toString()); //He

buf[1] = 111; //o

console.log(slice.toString()); //Ho
```

### Copy a buffer

Copying a buffer is possible using the `set()` method:

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');

const bufcopy = Buffer.alloc(4); //allocate 4 bytes

bufcopy.set(buf);
```

By default you copy the whole buffer. If you only want to copy a part of the buffer, you can use `.subarray()` and the `offset` argument that specifies an offset to write to:

```js
//
const buf = Buffer.from('Hey?');

const bufcopy = Buffer.from('Moo!');

bufcopy.set(buf.subarray(1, 3), 1);

bufcopy.toString(); //'Mey!'
```

# Node.js Streams

description: 'Learn what streams are for, why are they so important, and how to use them.'

## What are streams

Streams are one of the fundamental concepts that power Node.js applications.

They are a way to handle reading/writing files, network communications, or any kind of end-to-end information exchange in an efficient way.

Streams are not a concept unique to Node.js. They were introduced in the Unix operating system decades ago, and programs can interact with each other passing streams through the pipe operator (`|`).

For example, in the traditional way, when you tell the program to read a file, the file is read into memory, from start to finish, and then you process it.

Using streams you read it piece by piece, processing its content without keeping it all in memory.

The Node.js [`stream` module](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html) provides the foundation upon which all streaming APIs are built.

All streams are instances of [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)

## Why streams

Streams basically provide two major advantages over using other data handling methods:

-   **Memory efficiency**: you don't need to load large amounts of data in memory before you are able to process it
-
-   **Time efficiency**: it takes way less time to start processing data, since you can start processing as soon as you have it, rather than waiting till the whole data payload is available

## An example of a stream

A typical example is reading files from a disk.

Using the Node.js `fs` module, you can read a file, and serve it over HTTP when a new connection is established to your HTTP server:

```js
//
const http = require('http');

const fs = require('fs');

const server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    fs.readFile(__dirname + '/data.txt', (err, data) => {
        res.end(data);
    });
});

server.listen(3000);
```

`readFile()` reads the full contents of the file, and invokes the callback function when it's done.

`res.end(data)` in the callback will return the file contents to the HTTP client.

If the file is big, the operation will take quite a bit of time. Here is the same thing written using streams:

```js
//
const http = require('http');

const fs = require('fs');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    const stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/data.txt');

    stream.pipe(res);
});

server.listen(3000);
```

Instead of waiting until the file is fully read, we start streaming it to the HTTP client as soon as we have a chunk of data ready to be sent.

## pipe()

The above example uses the line `stream.pipe(res)`: the `pipe()` method is called on the file stream.

What does this code do? It takes the source, and pipes it into a destination.

You call it on the source stream, so in this case, the file stream is piped to the HTTP response.

The return value of the `pipe()` method is the destination stream, which is a very convenient thing that lets us chain multiple `pipe()` calls, like this:

```js
//
src.pipe(dest1).pipe(dest2);
```

This construct is the same as doing

```js
//
src.pipe(dest1);

dest1.pipe(dest2);
```

## Streams-powered Node.js APIs

Due to their advantages, many Node.js core modules provide native stream handling capabilities, most notably:

-   `process.stdin` returns a stream connected to stdin
-
-   `process.stdout` returns a stream connected to stdout
-
-   `process.stderr` returns a stream connected to stderr
-
-   `fs.createReadStream()` creates a readable stream to a file
-
-   `fs.createWriteStream()` creates a writable strea
-
-   `net.connect()` initiates a stream-based connection

-   `http.request()` returns an instance of the http.ClientRequest class, which is a writable stream

-   `zlib.createGzip()` compress data using gzip (a compression algorithm) into a stream

-   `zlib.createGunzip()` decompress a gzip stream.

-   `zlib.createDeflate()` compress data using deflate (a compression algorithm) into a stream

-   `zlib.createInflate()` decompress a deflate stream

## Different types of streams

There are four classes of streams:

-   `Readable`: a stream you can pipe from, but not pipe into (you can receive data, but not send data to it). When you push data into a readable stream, it is buffered, until a consumer starts to read the data.
-
-   `Writable`: a stream you can pipe into, but not pipe from (you can send data, but not receive from it)
-
-   `Duplex`: a stream you can both pipe into and pipe from, basically a combination of a Readable and Writable stream

-   `Transform`: a Transform stream is similar to a Duplex, but the output is a transform of its input

## How to create a readable stream

We get the Readable stream from the [`stream` module](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html), and we initialize it and implement the `readable._read()` method.

First create a stream object:

```js
//
const Stream = require('stream');

const readableStream = new Stream.Readable();
```

then implement `_read`:

```js
//
readableStream._read = () => {};
```

You can also implement `_read` using the `read` option:

```js
//
const readableStream = new Stream.Readable({
    read() {}
});
```

Now that the stream is initialized, we can send data to it:

```js
//
readableStream.push('hi!');

readableStream.push('ho!');
```

## How to create a writable stream

To create a writable stream we extend the base `Writable` object, and we implement its \_write() method.

First create a stream object:

```js
//
const Stream = require('stream');

const writableStream = new Stream.Writable();
```

then implement `_write`:

```js
//
writableStream._write = (chunk, encoding, next) => {
    console.log(chunk.toString());

    next();
};
```

You can now pipe a

readable stream in:

```js
//
process.stdin.pipe(writableStream);
```

## How to get data from a readable stream

How do we read data from a readable stream? Using a writable stream:

```js
//
const Stream = require('stream');

const readableStream = new Stream.Readable({
    read() {}
});

const writableStream = new Stream.Writable();

writableStream._write = (chunk, encoding, next) => {
    console.log(chunk.toString());

    next();
};

readableStream.pipe(writableStream);

readableStream.push('hi!');

readableStream.push('ho!');
```

You can also consume a readable stream directly, using the `readable` event:

```js
//
readableStream.on('readable', () => {
    console.log(readableStream.read());
});
```

## How to send data to a writable stream

Using the stream `write()` method:

```js
//
writableStream.write('hey!\n');
```

## Signaling a writable stream that you ended writing

Use the `end()` method:

```js
//
const Stream = require('stream');

const readableStream = new Stream.Readable({
    read() {}
});

const writableStream = new Stream.Writable();

writableStream._write = (chunk, encoding, next) => {
    console.log(chunk.toString());

    next();
};

readableStream.pipe(writableStream);

readableStream.push('hi!');

readableStream.push('ho!');

writableStream.end();
```

## How to create a transform stream

We get the Transform stream from the [`stream` module](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html), and we initialize it and implement the `transform._transform()` method.

First create a transform stream object:

```js
//
const { Transform } = require('stream');

const TransformStream = new Transform();
```

then implement `_transform`:

```js
//
TransformStream._transform = (chunk, encoding, callback) => {
    TransformStream.push(chunk.toString().toUpperCase());

    callback();
};
```

Pipe readable stream:

```js
//
process.stdin.pipe(TransformStream).pipe(process.stdout);
```

# Node.js, the difference between development and production

description: 'Learn how to set up different configurations for production and development environments'

You can have different configurations for production and development environments.

Node.js assumes it's always running in a development environment.

You can signal Node.js that you are running in production by setting the `NODE_ENV=production` environment variable.

This is usually done by executing the command

```bash

export NODE_ENV=production

```

in the shell, but it's better to put it in your shell configuration file (e.g. `.bash_profile` with the Bash shell) because otherwise the setting does not persist in case of a system restart.

You can also apply the environment variable by prepending it to your application initialization command:

```bash

NODE_ENV=production node app.js

```

This environment variable is a convention that is widely used in external libraries as well.

Setting the environment to `production` generally ensures that

-   logging is kept to a minimum, essential level
-
-   more caching levels take place to optimize performance

For example Pug, the templating library used by Express, compiles in debug mode if `NODE_ENV` is not set to `production`. Express views are compiled in every request in development mode, while in production they are cached. There are many more examples.

You can use conditional statements to execute code in different environments:

```js
//

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {

  //...

}

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {

  //...

}

if(['production', 'staging'].indexOf(process.env.NODE_ENV) >= 0) {

  //...

})

```

For example, in an Express app, you can use this to set different error handlers per environment:

```js
//

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {

  app.use(express.errorHandler({ dumpExceptions: true, showStack: true }))

})

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {

  app.use(express.errorHandler())

})

```

# Error handling in Node.js

description: 'How to handle errors during the execution of a Node.js application'

Errors in Node.js are handled through exceptions.

## Creating exceptions

An exception is created using the `throw` keyword:

```js
//
throw value;
```

As soon as JavaScript executes this line, the normal program flow is halted and the control is held back to the nearest **exception handler**.

Usually in client-side code `value` can be any JavaScript value including a string, a number or an object.

In Node.js, we don't throw strings, we just throw Error objects.

## Error objects

An error object is an object that is either an instance of the Error object, or extends the Error class, provided in the [Error core module](https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html):

```js
//
throw new Error('Ran out of coffee');
```

or

```js
//
class NotEnoughCoffeeError extends Error {
    //...
}

throw new NotEnoughCoffeeError();
```

## Handling exceptions

An exception handler is a `try`/`catch` statement.

Any exception raised in the lines of code included in the `try` block is handled in the corresponding `catch` block:

```js
//
try {
    //lines of code
} catch (e) {}
```

`e` in this example is the exception value.

You can add multiple handlers, that can catch different kinds of errors.

## Catching uncaught exceptions

If an uncaught exception gets thrown during the execution of your program, your program will crash.

To solve this, you listen for the `uncaughtException` event on the `process` object:

```js
//
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
    console.error('There was an uncaught error', err);

    process.exit(1); //mandatory (as per the Node.js docs)
});
```

You don't need to import the `process` core module for this, as it's automatically injected.

## Exceptions with promises

Using promises you can chain different operations, and handle errors at the end:

```js
//
doSomething1()
    .then(doSomething2)

    .then(doSomething3)

    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

How do you know where the error occurred? You don't really know, but you can handle errors in each of the functions you call (`doSomethingX`), and inside the error handler throw a new error, that's going to call the outside `catch` handler:

```js
//
const doSomething1 = () => {
    //...

    try {
        //...
    } catch (err) {
        //... handle it locally

        throw new Error(err.message);
    }

    //...
};
```

To be able to handle errors locally without handling them in the function we call, we can break the chain. You can create a function in each `then()` and process the exception:

```js
//
doSomething1()
    .then(() => {
        return doSomething2().catch((err) => {
            //handle error

            throw err; //break the chain!
        });
    })

    .then(() => {
        return doSomething3().catch((err) => {
            //handle error

            throw err; //break the chain!
        });
    })

    .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

## Error handling with async/await

Using async/await, you still need to catch errors, and you do it this way:

```js
//
async function someFunction() {
    try {
        await someOtherFunction();
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err.message);
    }
}
```

# How to log an object in Node.js

description: 'Logging objects in Node.js'

When you type `console.log()` into a JavaScript program that runs in the browser, that is going to create a nice entry in the Browser Console:

![alt-text](images/console-log-browser.png)

Once you click the arrow, the log is expanded, and you can clearly see the object properties:

![alt-text](images/console-log-browser-expanded.png)

In Node.js, the same happens.

We don't have such luxury when we log something to the console, because that's going to output the object to the shell if you run the Node.js program manually, or to the log file. You get a string representation of the object.

Now, all is fine until a certain level of nesting. After two levels of nesting, Node.js gives up and prints `[Object]` as a placeholder:

```js
//

const obj = {

  name: 'joe',

  age: 35,

  person1: {

    name: 'Tony',

    age: 50,

    person2: {

      name: 'Albert',

      age: 21,

      person3: {

        name: 'Peter',

        age: 23

      }

    }

  }

}

console.log(obj)

{

  name: 'joe',

  age: 35,

  person1: {

    name: 'Tony',

    age: 50,

    person2: {

      name: 'Albert',

      age: 21,

      person3: [Object]

    }

  }

}

```

How can you print the whole object?

The best way to do so, while preserving the pretty print, is to use

```js
//
console.log(JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2));
```

where `2` is the number of spaces to use for indentation.

Another option is to use

```js
//
require('util').inspect.defaultOptions.depth = null;

console.log(obj);
```

but the problem is that the nested objects after level 2 are now flattened, and this might be a problem with complex objects.

# 'Node.js with TypeScript'

description: 'Find out why TypeScript is an awesome tool and learn to use it by yourself.'

## What is TypeScript

TypeScript is a very popular open-source language maintained and developed by Microsoft, it's loved and used by a lot of software developers around the world.

Basically, it's a superset of JavaScript that adds new capabilities to the language. Most notable addition are static type definitions, something that is not present in plain JavaScript. Thanks to types, it's possible, for example, to declare what kind of arguments we are expecting and what is returned exactly in our functions or what's the exact shape of the object that we are creating. TypeScript is a really powerful tool and opens new world of possibilities in JavaScript projects. It makes our code more secure and robust by preventing a lot of bugs before code is even shipped - it catches problems during writing the code and integrates wonderfully with code editors like Visual Studio Code.

We can talk about other TypeScript benefits later, let's see some examples now!

## Examples

Take a look at this code snippet and then we can unpack it together:

```js
//
type User = {
    name: string,

    age: number
};

function isAdult(user: User): boolean {
    return user.age >= 18;
}

const justine: User = {
    name: 'Justine',

    age: 23
};

const isJustineAnAdult: boolean = isAdult(justine);
```

First part with `type` keyword is responsible for declaring our custom type of objects representing users. Later we utilize this newly created type to create function `isAdult` that accepts one argument of type `User` and returns `boolean`. After this we create `justine`, our example data that can be used for calling previously defined function. Finally, we create new variable with information whether `justine` is an adult or not.

There are additional things about this example that you should know. Firstly, if we would not comply with declared types, TypeScript would alarm us that something is wrong and prevent misuse. Secondly, not everything must be typed explicitly - TypeScript is very smart and can deduce types for us. For example, variable `isJustineAnAdult` would be of type `boolean` even if we didn't type it explicitly or `justine` would be valid argument for our function even if we didn't declare this variable as of `User` type.

Okay, so we have some TypeScript code. Now how do we run it?

First thing to do is to install TypeScript in our project:

```bash

npm i -D typescript

```

Now we can compile it to JavaScript using `tsc` command in the terminal. Let's do it!

Assuming that our file is named `example.ts`, the command would look like:

```bash

tsc example.ts

```

This command will result in a new file named `example.js` that we can run using Node.js.

Now when we know how to compile and run TypeScript code let's see TypeScript bug-preventing capabilities in action!

This is how we will modify our code:

```js
//
type User = {
    name: string,

    age: number
};

function isAdult(user: User): boolean {
    return user.age >= 18;
}

const justine: User = {
    name: 'Justine',

    age: 'Secret!'
};

const isJustineAnAdult: string = isAdult(justine, "I shouldn't be here!");
```

And this is what TypeScript has to say about this:

```js
//

example.ts:12:3 - error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

12   age: "Secret!",

     ~~~

  example.ts:3:3

    3   age: number;

        ~~~

    The expected type comes from property 'age' which is declared here on type 'User'

example.ts:15:7 - error TS2322: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'.

15 const isJustineAnAdult: string = isAdult(justine, "I shouldn't be here!");

         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

example.ts:15:51 - error TS2554: Expected 1 arguments, but got 2.

15 const isJustineAnAdult: string = isAdult(justine, "I shouldn't be here!");

                                                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Found 3 errors.

```

As you can see TypeScript successfully prevents us from shipping code that could work unexpectedly. That's wonderful!

## More about TypeScript

TypeScript offers a whole lot of other great mechanisms like interfaces, classes, utility types and so on. Also, on bigger projects you can declare your TypeScript compiler configuration in a separate file and granularly adjust how it works, how strict it is and where it stores compiled files for example. You can read more about all this awesome stuff in [the official TypeScript docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs).

Some of the other benefits of TypeScript that are worth mentioning are that it can be adopted progressively, it helps making code more readable and understandable and it allows developers to use modern language features while shipping code for older Node.js versions.

## TypeScript in the Node.js world

TypeScript is well-established in the Node.js world and used by many companies, open-source projects, tools and frameworks.

Some of the notable examples of open-source projects using TypeScript are:

-   [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - robust and fully-featured framework that makes creating scalable and well-architected systems easy and pleasant
-
-   [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) - great ORM influenced by other well-known tools from other languages like Hibernate, Doctrine or Entity Framewor
-
-   [Prisma](https://prisma.io/) - next-generation ORM featuring a declarative data model, generated migrations and fully type-safe database queries

-   [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) - widely used library for reactive programming

-   [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com) - A fully featured web framework with Node.js

And many, many more great projects... Maybe even your next one!

# Differences between Node.js and the Browser

description: 'How writing JavaScript application in Node.js differs from programming for the Web inside the browser'

Both the browser and Node.js use JavaScript as their programming language.

Building apps that run in the browser is a completely different thing than building a Node.js application.

Despite the fact that it's always JavaScript, there are some key differences that make the experience radically different.

From the perspective of a frontend developer who extensively uses JavaScript, Node.js apps bring with them a huge advantage: the comfort of programming everything - the frontend and the backend - in a single language.

You have a huge opportunity because we know how hard it is to fully, deeply learn a programming language, and by using the same language to perform all your work on the web - both on the client and on the server, you're in a unique position of advantage.

What changes is the ecosystem.

In the browser, most of the time what you are doing is interacting with the DOM, or other Web Platform APIs like Cookies. Those do not exist in Node.js, of course. You don't have the `document`, `window` and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.

And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, like the filesystem access functionality.

Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment. Unless you are building an open source application that anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node.js you will run the application on. Compared to the browser environment, where you don't get the luxury to choose what browser your visitors will use, this is very convenient.

This means that you can write all the modern ES6-7-8-9 JavaScript that your Node.js version supports.

Since JavaScript moves so fast, but browsers can be a bit slow to upgrade, sometimes on the web you are stuck with using older JavaScript / ECMAScript releases.

You can use Babel to transform your code to be ES5-compatible before shipping it to the browser, but in Node.js, you won't need that.

Another difference is that Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, while in the browser we are starting to see the ES Modules standard being implemented.

In practice, this means that for the time being you use `require()` in Node.js and `import` in the browser.

# The V8 JavaScript Engine

description: "V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome. V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript executes. The DOM and the other Web Platform APIs are provided by the browser."

---

V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome.

V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript executes. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs are provided by the browser.

The cool thing is that the JavaScript engine is independent of the browser in which it's hosted. This key feature enabled the rise of Node.js. V8 was chosen to be the engine that powered Node.js back in 2009, and as the popularity of Node.js exploded, V8 became the engine that now powers an incredible amount of server-side code written in JavaScript.

The Node.js ecosystem is huge and thanks to V8 which also powers desktop apps, with projects like Electron.

## Other JS engines

Other browsers have their own JavaScript engine:

-   Firefox has [**SpiderMonkey**](https://spidermonkey.dev)
-
-   Safari has [**JavaScriptCore**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore) (also called Nitro)

-   Edge was originally based on [**Chakra**](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore) but has more recently been [rebuilt using Chromium](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4501095/download-the-new-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium) and the V8 engine.

and many others exist as well.

All those engines implement the [ECMA ES-262 standard](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm), also called ECMAScript, the standard used by JavaScript.

## The quest for performance

V8 is written in C++, and it's continuously improved. It is portable and runs on Mac, Windows, Linux and several other systems.

In this V8 introduction, we will ignore the implementation details of V8: they can be found on more authoritative sites (e.g. the [V8 official site](https://v8.dev/)), and they change over time, often radically.

V8 is always evolving, just like the other JavaScript engines around, to speed up the Web and the Node.js ecosystem.

On the web, there is a race for performance that's been going on for years, and we (as users and developers) benefit a lot from this competition because we get faster and more optimized machines year after year.

## Compilation

JavaScript is generally considered an interpreted language, but modern JavaScript engines no longer just interpret JavaScript, they compile it.

This has been happening since 2009, when the SpiderMonkey JavaScript compiler was added to Firefox 3.5, and everyone followed this idea.

JavaScript is internally compiled by V8 with **just-in-time** (JIT) **compilation** to speed up the execution.

This might seem counter-intuitive, but since the introduction of Google Maps in 2004, JavaScript has evolved from a language that was generally executing a few dozens of lines of code to complete applications with thousands to hundreds of thousands of lines running in the browser.

Our applications can now run for hours inside a browser, rather than being just a few form validation rules or simple scripts.

In this _new world_, compiling JavaScript makes perfect sense because while it might take a little bit more to have the JavaScript _ready_, once done it's going to be much more performant than purely interpreted code.

# Run Node.js scripts from the command line

description: 'How to run any Node.js script from the CLI'

The usual way to run a Node.js program is to run the `node` globally available command (once you install Node.js) and pass the name of the file you want to execute.

If your main Node.js application file is `app.js`, you can call it by typing:

```bash

node app.js

```

Above, you are explicitly telling the shell to run your script with `node`. You can also embed this information into your JavaScript file with a "shebang" line. The "shebang" is the first line in the file, and tells the OS which interpreter to use for running the script. Below is the first line of JavaScript:

```bash

#!/usr/bin/node

```

Above, we are explicitly giving the absolute path of interpreter. Not all operating systems have `node` in the bin folder, but all should have `env`. You can tell the OS to run `env` with node as parameter:

```bash

#!/usr/bin/env node

// your code

```

To use a shebang, your file should have executable permission. You can give `app.js` the executable permission by running:

```bash

chmod u+x app.js

```

While running the command, make sure you are in the same directory which contains the `app.js` file.

# How to exit from a Node.js program

description: 'Learn how to terminate a Node.js app in the best possible way'

There are various ways to terminate a Node.js application.

When running a program in the console you can close it with `ctrl-C`, but what we want to discuss here is programmatically exiting.

Let's start with the most drastic one, and see why you're better off _not_ using it.

The `process` core module provides a handy method that allows you to programmatically exit from a Node.js program: `process.exit()`.

When Node.js runs this line, the process is immediately forced to terminate.

This means that any callback that's pending, any network request still being sent, any filesystem access, or processes writing to `stdout` or `stderr` - all is going to be ungracefully terminated right away.

If this is fine for you, you can pass an integer that signals the operating system the exit code:

```js
//
process.exit(1);
```

By default the exit code is `0`, which means success. Different exit codes have different meaning, which you might want to use in your own system to have the program communicate to other programs.

You can read more on exit codes at <https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_exit_codes>

You can also set the `process.exitCode` property:

```js
//
process.exitCode = 1;
```

and when the program ends, Node.js will return that exit code.

A program will gracefully exit when all the processing is done.

Many times with Node.js we start servers, like this HTTP server:

```js
//
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hi!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server ready'));
```

> Express is a framework that uses the http module under the hood, app.listen() returns an instance of http. You would use https.createServer if you needed to serve your app using HTTPS, as app.listen only uses the http module.

This program is never going to end. If you call `process.exit()`, any currently pending or running request is going to be aborted. This is _not nice_.

In this case you need to send the command a SIGTERM signal, and handle that with the process signal handler:

> Note: `process` does not require a "require", it's automatically available.

```js
//
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hi!');
});

const server = app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server ready'));

process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
    server.close(() => {
        console.log('Process terminated');
    });
});
```

> What are signals? Signals are a POSIX intercommunication system: a notification sent to a process in order to notify it of an event that occurred.

`SIGKILL` is the signal that tells a process to immediately terminate, and would ideally act like `process.exit()`.

`SIGTERM` is the signal that tells a process to gracefully terminate. It is the signal that's sent from process managers like `upstart` or `supervisord` and many others.

You can send this signal from inside the program, in another function:

```js
//
process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGTERM');
```

Or from another Node.js running program, or any other app running in your system that knows the PID of the process you want to terminate.

# How to read environment variables from Node.js

description: 'Learn how to read and make use of environment variables in a Node.js program'

The `process` core module of Node.js provides the `env` property which hosts all the environment variables that were set at the moment the process was started.

The below code runs `app.js` and set `USER_ID` and `USER_KEY`.

```bash

USER_ID=239482 USER_KEY=foobar node app.js

```

That will pass the user `USER_ID` as **239482** and the `USER_KEY` as **foobar**. This is suitable for testing, however for production, you will probably be configuring some bash scripts to export variables.

> Note: `process` does not require a "require", it's automatically available.

Here is an example that accesses the `USER_ID` and `USER_KEY` environment variables, which we set in above code.

```js
//
process.env.USER_ID; // "239482"

process.env.USER_KEY; // "foobar"
```

In the same way you can access any custom environment variable you set.

If you have multiple environment variables in your node project, you can also create an `.env` file in the root directory of your project, and then use the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to load them during runtime.

```bash

# .env file

USER_ID="239482"

USER_KEY="foobar"

NODE_ENV="development"

```

In your js file

```js
//
require('dotenv').config();

process.env.USER_ID; // "239482"

process.env.USER_KEY; // "foobar"

process.env.NODE_ENV; // "development"
```

> You can also run your js file with `node -r dotenv/config index.js` command if you don't want to import the package in your code.

# 'Node.js with WebAssembly'

description: 'Find out why WebAssembly is an awesome tool and learn to use it by yourself.'

WebAssembly is a high-performance assembly-like language that can be compiled from a myriad of languages including C/C++, Rust, and AssemblyScript. As of right now, it is supported by Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Node.js!

The WebAssembly specification details two file formats, a binary format called a WebAssembly Module with a `.wasm` extension and corresponding text representation called WebAssembly Text format with a `.wat` extension.

## Key Concepts

-   Module - A compiled WebAssembly binary, ie a `.wasm` file.
-
-   Memory - A resizable ArrayBuffer.
-
-   Table - A resizable typed array of references not stored in Memory.

-   Instance - An instantiation of a Module with its Memory, Table, and variables.

In order to use WebAssembly, you need a `.wasm` binary file and a set of APIs to communicate with WebAssembly. Node.js provides the necessary APIs via the global `WebAssembly` object.

```js
//
console.log(WebAssembly);

/*

Object [WebAssembly] {

  compile: [Function: compile],

  validate: [Function: validate],

  instantiate: [Function: instantiate]

}

*/
```

## Generating WebAssembly Modules

There are multiple methods available to generate WebAssembly binary files including:

-   Writing WebAssembly (`.wat`) by hand and converting to binary format using tools such as [wabt](https://github.com/webassembly/wabt)
-
-   Using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) with a C/C++ application
-
-   Using [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/) with a Rust application

-   Using [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) if you prefer a TypeScript-like experience

> Some of these tools generate not only the binary file, but the JavaScript "glue" code and corresponding HTML files to run in the browser.

## How to use it

Once you have a WebAssembly module, you can use the Node.js `WebAssembly` object to instantiate it.

```js
//
// Assume add.wasm file exists that contains a single function adding 2 provided arguments

const fs = require('fs');

const wasmBuffer = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/add.wasm');

WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBuffer).then((wasmModule) => {
    // Exported function live under instance.exports

    const add = wasmModule.instance.exports.add;

    const sum = add(5, 6);

    console.log(sum); // Outputs: 11
});
```

## Interacting with the OS

WebAssembly modules cannot directly access OS functionality on its own. A third-party tool [Wasmtime](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/) can be used to access this functionality. `Wasmtime` utilizes the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) API to access the OS functionality.
