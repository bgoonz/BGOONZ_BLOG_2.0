This appendix is a non-exhaustive list of new syntactic features and methods that were added to JavaScript in ES6. These features are the most commonly used and most helpful.

While this appendix doesn't cover ES6 classes, we go over the basics while learning about components in the book. In addition, this appendix doesn't include descriptions of some larger new features like promises and generators. If you'd like more info on those or on any topic below, we encourage you to reference the [Mozilla Developer Network's website](https://developer.mozilla.org/) \(MDN\).

## Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`

If you've worked with ES5 JavaScript before, you're likely used to seeing variables declared with `var`:

```text
ar myVariable = 5;
```

Both the `const` and `let` statements also declare variables. They were introduced in ES6.

Use `const` in cases where a variable is never re-assigned. Using `const` makes this clear to whoever is reading your code. It refers to the "constant" state of the variable in the context it is defined within.

If the variable will be re-assigned, use `let`.

We encourage the use of `const` and `let` instead of `var`. In addition to the restriction introduced by `const`, both `const` and `let` are _block scoped_ as opposed to _function scoped_. This scoping can help avoid unexpected bugs.

## Arrow functions

There are three ways to write arrow function bodies. For the examples below, let's say we have an array of city objects:

```text
onst cities = [
  { name: 'Cairo', pop: 7764700 },
  { name: 'Lagos', pop: 8029200 },
];
```

If we write an arrow function that spans multiple lines, we must use braces to delimit the function body like this:

```text
const formattedPopulations = cities.map((city) => {
  const popMM = (city.pop / 1000000).toFixed(2);
  return popMM + ' million';
});
console.log(formattedPopulations);
```

Note that we must also explicitly specify a `return` for the function.

However, if we write a function body that is only a single line \(or single expression\) we can use parentheses to delimit it:

```text
const formattedPopulations2 = cities.map((city) => (
  (city.pop / 1000000).toFixed(2) + ' million'
));
```

Notably, we don't use `return` as it's implied.

Furthermore, if your function body is terse you can write it like so:

```text
const pops = cities.map(city => city.pop);
console.log(pops);
```

The terseness of arrow functions is one of two reasons that we use them. Compare the one-liner above to this:

```text
const popsNoArrow = cities.map(function(city) { return city.pop });
```

Of greater benefit, though, is how arrow functions bind the `this` object.

The traditional JavaScript function declaration syntax \(`function () {}`\) will bind `this` in anonymous functions to the global object. To illustrate the confusion this causes, consider the following example:

```text
unction printSong() {
  console.log("Oops - The Global Object");
}

const jukebox = {
  songs: [
    {
      title: "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'",
      artist: "Michael Jackson",
    },
    {
      title: "Superstar",
      artist: "Madonna",
    },
  ],
  printSong: function (song) {
    console.log(song.title + " - " + song.artist);
  },
  printSongs: function () {

    this.songs.forEach(function(song) {

      this.printSong(song);
    });
  },
}

jukebox.printSongs();
```

The method `printSongs()` iterates over `this.songs` with `forEach()`. In this context, `this` is bound to the object \(`jukebox`\) as expected. However, the anonymous function passed to `forEach()` binds its internal `this` to the global object. As such, `this.printSong(song)` calls the function declared at the top of the example, _not_ the method on `jukebox`.

JavaScript developers have traditionally used workarounds for this behavior, but arrow functions solve the problem by **capturing the `this` value of the enclosing context**. Using an arrow function for `printSongs()` has the expected result:

```text
  printSongs: function () {
    this.songs.forEach((song) => {

      this.printSong(song);
    });
  },
}

jukebox.printSongs();
```

For this reason, throughout the book we use arrow functions for all anonymous functions.

## Modules

ES6 formally supports modules using the `import`/`export` syntax.

**Named exports**

Inside any file, you can use `export` to specify a variable the module should expose. Here's an example of a file that exports two functions:

```text
export const sayHi = () => (console.log('Hi!'));
export const sayBye = () => (console.log('Bye!'));

const saySomething = () => (console.log('Something!'));
```

Now, anywhere we wanted to use these functions we could use `import`. We need to specify which functions we want to import. A common way of doing this is using ES6's destructuring assignment syntax to list them out like this:

```text
import { sayHi, sayBye } from './greetings';

sayHi();
sayBye();
```

Importantly, the function that was _not_ exported \(`saySomething`\) is unavailable outside of the module.

Also note that we supply a **relative path** to `from`, indicating that the ES6 module is a local file as opposed to an npm package.

Instead of inserting an `export` before each variable you'd like to export, you can use this syntax to list off all the exposed variables in one area:

```text
const sayHi = () => (console.log('Hi!'));
const sayBye = () => (console.log('Bye!'));

const saySomething = () => (console.log('Something!'));

export { sayHi, sayBye };
```

We can also specify that we'd like to import all of a module's functionality underneath a given namespace with the `import * as <Namespace>` syntax:

```text
import * as Greetings from './greetings';

Greetings.sayHi();

Greetings.sayBye();

Greetings.saySomething();
```

**Default export**

The other type of export is a default export. A module can only contain one default export:

```text
const sayHi = () => (console.log('Hi!'));
const sayBye = () => (console.log('Bye!'));

const saySomething = () => (console.log('Something!'));

const Greetings = { sayHi, sayBye };

export default Greetings;
```

This is a common pattern for libraries. It means you can easily import the library wholesale without specifying what individual functions you want:

```text
import Greetings from './greetings';

Greetings.sayHi();
Greetings.sayBye();
```

It's not uncommon for a module to use a mix of both named exports and default exports. For instance, with `react-dom`, you can import `ReactDOM` \(a default export\) like this:

```text
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(

);
```

Or, if you're only going to use the `render()` function, you can import the named `render()` function like this:

```text
import { render } from 'react-dom';

render(

);
```

To achieve this flexibility, the export implementation for `react-dom` looks something like this:

```text
export const render = (component, target) => {

};

const ReactDOM = {
  render,

};

export default ReactDOM;
```

If you want to play around with the module syntax, check out the folder `code/webpack/es6-modules`.

## `Object.assign()`

We use `Object.assign()` often throughout the book. We use it in areas where we want to create a modified version of an existing object.

`Object.assign()` accepts any number of objects as arguments. When the function receives two arguments, it _copies_ the properties of the second object onto the first, like so:

```text
onst coffee = { };
const noCream = { cream: false };
const noMilk = { milk: false };
Object.assign(coffee, noCream);
```

It is idiomatic to pass in three arguments to `Object.assign()`. The first argument is a new JavaScript object, the one that `Object.assign()` will ultimately return. The second is the object whose properties we'd like to build off of. The last is the changes we'd like to apply:

```text
const coffeeWithMilk = Object.assign({}, coffee, { milk: true });
```

`Object.assign()` is a handy method for working with "immutable" JavaScript objects.

## Template literals

In ES5 JavaScript, you'd interpolate variables into strings like this:

```text
var greeting = 'Hello, ' + user + '! It is ' + degF + ' degrees outside.';
```

With ES6 template literals, we can create the same string like this:

```text
const greeting = `Hello, ${user}! It is ${degF} degrees outside.`;
```

## The spread operator \(`...`\)

In arrays, the ellipsis `...` operator will _expand_ the array that follows into the parent array. The spread operator enables us to succinctly construct new arrays as a composite of existing arrays.

Here is an example:

```text
onst a = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
const b = [ 4, 5, 6 ];
const c = [ ...a, ...b, 7, 8, 9 ];

console.log(c);
```

Notice how this is different than if we wrote:

```text
const d = [ a, b, 7, 8, 9 ];
console.log(d);
```

## Enhanced object literals

In ES5, all objects were required to have explicit key and value declarations:

```text
const explicit = {
  getState: getState,
  dispatch: dispatch,
};
```

In ES6, you can use this terser syntax whenever the property name and variable name are the same:

```text
const implicit = {
  getState,
  dispatch,
};
```

Lots of open source libraries use this syntax, so it's good to be familiar with it. But whether you use it in your own code is a matter of stylistic preference.

## Default arguments

With ES6, you can specify a default value for an argument in the case that it is `undefined` when the function is called.

This:

```text
unction divide(a, b) {

  const divisor = typeof b === 'undefined' ? 1 : b;

  return a / divisor;
}
```

Can be written as this:

```text
function divide(a, b = 1) {
  return a / b;
}
```

In both cases, using the function looks like this:

```text
divide(14, 2);

divide(14, undefined);

divide(14);
```

Whenever the argument `b` in the example above is `undefined`, the default argument is used. Note that `null` will not use the default argument:

```text
divide(14, null);
```

## Destructuring assignments

### For arrays

In ES5, extracting and assigning multiple elements from an array looked like this:

```text
ar fruits = [ 'apples', 'bananas', 'oranges' ];
var fruit1 = fruits[0];
var fruit2 = fruits[1];
```

In ES6, we can use the destructuring syntax to accomplish the same task like this:

```text
const [ veg1, veg2 ] = [ 'asparagus', 'broccoli', 'onion' ];
console.log(veg1);
console.log(veg2);
```

The variables in the array on the left are "matched" and assigned to the corresponding elements in the array on the right. Note that `'onion'` is ignored and has no variable bound to it.

### For objects

We can do something similar for extracting object properties into variables:

```text
const smoothie = {
  fats: [ 'avocado', 'peanut butter', 'greek yogurt' ],
  liquids: [ 'almond milk' ],
  greens: [ 'spinach' ],
  fruits: [ 'blueberry', 'banana' ],
};

const { liquids, fruits } = smoothie;

console.log(liquids);
console.log(fruits);
```

### Parameter context matching

We can use these same principles to bind arguments inside a function to properties of an object supplied as an argument:

```text
const containsSpinach = ({ greens }) => {
  if (greens.find(g => g === 'spinach')) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};

containsSpinach(smoothie);
```

We do this often with functional React components:

```text
const IngredientList = ({ ingredients, onClick }) => (
  <ul className='IngredientList'>
    {
      ingredients.map(i => (
        <li
          key={i.id}
          onClick={() => onClick(i.id)}
          className='item'
        >
          {i.name}
        </li>
      ))
    }
  </ul>
)
```

Here, we use destructuring to extract the props into variables \(`ingredients` and `onClick`\) that we then use inside the component's function body.
