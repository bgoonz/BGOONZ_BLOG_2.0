## Term: '502'

- '502'
- Bad Gateway
- Glossary
- HTTP Errors
- Infrastructure
- Navigation

---

> An _Glossary("HTTP"_) error code meaning "Bad Gateway".

A _Glossary("Server", "server"_) can act as a gateway or proxy (go-between) between a client (like your Web browser) and another, upstream server. When you request to access a _Glossary("URL"_), the gateway server can relay your request to the upstream server. "502" means that the upstream server has returned an invalid response.

Normally the upstream server is not down (i.e. furnishes no response to the gateway/proxy), but does not understand the same data-exchange protocol as the gateway/proxy. Internet _Glossary("Protocol", "protocols"_) are quite explicit, and so a 502 usually means that one or both machines were incorrectly or incompletely programmed.

## Term: Abstraction

- Abstraction
- Coding
- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- Programming Language

---

> Abstraction in _Glossary("computer programming"_) is a way to reduce complexity and allow efficient design and implementation in complex software systems. It hides the technical complexity of systems behind simpler _Glossary("API", "APIs"_).

## Advantages of Data Abstraction

- Helps the user to avoid writing low level code.
- Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
- Can change internal implementation of class independently without affecting the user.
- Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.

## Example

```js
class ImplementAbstraction {
    // method to set values of internal members
    set(x, y) {
        this.a = x;
        this.b = y;
    }

    display() {
        console.log('a = ' + this.a);
        console.log('b = ' + this.b);
    }
}

const obj = new ImplementAbstraction();
obj.set(10, 20);
obj.display();
// a = 10
// b = 20
```

## Term: accent

- Glossary
- Input
- accent

---

> An **accent** is a typically bright color that contrasts with the more utilitarian background and foreground colors within a color scheme. These are present in the visual style of many platforms (though not all).

On the web, an accent is sometimes used in _HTMLElement("input"_) elements for the active portion of the control, for instance the background of a checked [checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox).

#### See also

### CSS related to the accent

You can set the color of the accent for a given element by setting the element's CSS _cssxref("accent-color"_) property to the appropriate _cssxref("&lt;color&gt;"_) value.

## Term: Accessibility tree

- AOM
- Accessibility
- DOM
- Glossary
- Reference

---

> The **accessibility tree** contains _Glossary("accessibility"_)-related information for most HTML elements.

Browsers convert markup into an internal representation called the _[DOM tree](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/How_to_create_a_DOM_tree)_. The DOM tree contains objects representing all the markup's elements, attributes, and text nodes. Browsers then create an accessibility tree based on the DOM tree, which is used by platform-specific Accessibility APIs to provide a representation that can be understood by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

There are four things in an accessibility tree object:

- **name**
- - : How can we refer to this thing? For instance, a link with the text "Read more" will have "Read more" as its name (find more on how names are computed in the [Accessible Name and Description Com
- **description**
- - : How do we describe this thing, if we want to provide more description beyond the name? The description of a table could explain what kind of information the table contains.
- **role**
    - : What kind of thing is it? For example, is it a button, a nav bar, or a list of items?
- **state**
    - : Does it have a state? Examples include checked or unchecked for checkboxes, and collapsed or expanded for the [`<summary>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary) element.

Additionally, the accessibility tree often contains information on what can be done with an element: a link can be _followed_, a text input can be _typed into_, etc.

While still in draft form within the Web Incubator Community Group, the **[Accessibility Object Model](https://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html) (AOM)** intends to incubate APIs that make it easier to express accessibility semantics and potentially allow read access to the computed accessibility tree.

---

> **Ajax**, which initially stood for Asynchronous _Glossary("JavaScript"_) And _Glossary("XML"_), is a programming practice of building complex, dynamic webpages using a technology known as _Glossary("XHR_(XMLHttpRequest)","XMLHttpRequest"\_).

Ajax allows you to update parts of the _Glossary("DOM"_) of an _Glossary("HTML"_) page without the need for a full page refresh. Ajax also lets you work asynchronously, meaning your code continues to run while the targeted part of your web page is trying to reload (compared to synchronously, which blocks your code from running until that part of your page is done reloading).

With interactive websites and modern web standards, Ajax is gradually being replaced by functions within JavaScript frameworks and the official _domxref("Fetch API"_) Standard.

## Term: Algorithm

- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> An algorithm is a self-contained series of instructions to perform a function.

In other words, an algorithm is a means of describing a way to solve a problem so that it can be solved repeatedly, by humans or machines. Computer scientists compare the efficiency of algorithms through the concept of "Algorithmic Complexity" or "Big O" notation.

For example:

- A cooking recipe is a simple algorithm for humans.
- A sorting algorithm is often used in computer programming to explain a machine how to sort data.

Common algorithms are Pathfinding algorithms such as the Traveling Salesman Problem, Tree Traversal algorithms and so on.

There are also Machine Learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Convolutional Neural Network and so on.

---

> In [CSS Box Alignment](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment) the **alignment subject** is the thing (or things) being aligned by the property.

For _cssxref("justify-self"_) and _cssxref("align-self"_), the alignment subject is the margin box of the box the property is set on, using the writing mode of that box.

For _cssxref("justify-content"_) and _cssxref("align-content"_), the writing mode of the box is also used. The definition of the alignment subject depends on the layout mode being used.

- Block containers (including table cells)
- - : The entire content of the block as a single unit.
- Multicol containers
    - : The column boxes, with any spacing inserted between column boxes added to the relevant column gaps.
- Flex containers
    - : For _cssxref("justify-content"_), the flex items in each flex line.
        For _cssxref("align-content"_), the flex lines. Note, this only has an effect on multi-line flex containers.
- Grid containers
    - : The grid tracks in the appropriate axis, with any spacing inserted between tracks added to the relevant gutters. Collapsed gutters are treated as a single opportunity for space insertion.

> Colors are represented in digital form as a collection of numbers, each representing the strength or intensity level of a given component of the color. Each of these components is called a **channel**. In a typical image file, the color channels describe how much red, green, and blue are used to make up the final color. To represent a color through which the background can be seen to some extent, a fourth channel is added to the color: the **alpha channel**. The alpha channel specifies how opaque the color is.

For example, the color `#8921F2` (also described as `rgb(137, 33, 242)` or `hsl(270, 89%, 54)`) is a nice shade of purple. Below you see a small box of that color in the top-left corner and a box of the _same_ color but with an alpha channel set at 0.5 (50% opacity). The two boxes are drawn on top of a paragraph of text.

![Image showing the effect of an alpha channel on a color.](alpha-channel-example.png)

As you can see, the color without an alpha channel completely blocks the background text, while the box with the alpha channel leaves it visible through the purple background color.

## Term: API

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- Infrastructure

---

> An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface. The API can be seen as a simple contract (the interface) between the application offering it and other items, such as third party software or hardware.

In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g. _glossary("method","methods"_), _Glossary("property","properties"_), events, and _Glossary("URL","URLs"_)) that a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser, or other software/hardware on the user's computer, or third party websites and services.

For example:

- The [getUserMedia](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia) API can be used to grab audio and video from a user's webcam, which can then be used in any way the developer likes, for example, recording video and audio, broadcasting it to another user in a conference call, or capturing image stills from the video.
- The [Geolocation API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation) can be used to retrieve location information from whatever service the user has available on their device (e.g. GPS), which can then be used in conjunction with the [Google Maps APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to for example plot the user's location on a custom map and show them what tourist attractions are in their area.
- The [Twitter APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api) can be used to retrieve data from a user's twitter accounts, for example, to display their latest tweets on a web page.
- The [Web Animations API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) can be used to animate parts of a web page — for example, to make images move around or rotate.

## Term: Asynchronous

- Glossary
- Web
- WebMechanics
- asynchronous

---

> The term **asynchronous** refers to two or more objects or events **not** existing or happening at the same time (or multiple related things happening without waiting for the previous one to complete). In computing, the word "asynchronous" is used in two major contexts.

- Networking and communications

    - : Asynchronous communication is a method of exchanging messages between two or more parties in which each party receives and processes messages whenever it's convenient or possible to do so, rather than doing so immediately upon receipt. Additionally, messages may be sent without waiting for acknowledgement, with the understanding that if a problem occurs, the recipient will request corrections or otherwise handle the situation.

        For humans, e-mail is an asynchronous communication method; the sender sends an email and the recipient will read and reply to the message when it's convenient to do so, rather than doing so at once. And both sides can continue to send and receive messages whenever they wish, instead of having to schedule them around each other.

        When software communicates asynchronously, a program may make a request for information from another piece of software (such as a server), and continue to do other things while waiting for a reply. For example, the [AJAX](/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX) (Asynchronous JavaScript and _Glossary("XML"_)) programming technique—now usually "Ajax", even though _Glossary("JSON"_) is usually used rather than XML in modern applications—is a mechanism that requests relatively small amounts of data from the server using _Glossary("HTTP"_), with the result being returned when available rather than immediately.

- Software design

    - : Asynchronous software design expands upon the concept by building code that allows a program to ask that a task be performed alongside the original task (or tasks), without stopping to wait for the task to complete. When the secondary task is completed, the original task is notified using an agreed-upon mechanism so that it knows the work is done, and that the result, if any, is available.

        There are a number of programming techniques for implementing asynchronous software. See the article [Asynchronous JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) for an introduction to them.

## Term: Attribute

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- HTML

---

> An **attribute** extends an HTML or XML _Glossary("element"_), changing its behavior or providing metadata.

An attribute always has the form `name="value"` (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value).

You may see attributes without the equals sign or a value. That is a shorthand for providing the empty string in HTML, or the attribute's name in XML.

```html
<input required />
<!-- is the same as… -->
<input required="" />
<!-- or -->
<input required="required" />
```

## Reflection of an attribute

Attributes may be _reflected_ into a particular property of the specific interface.
It means that the value of the attribute can be read by accessing the property,
and can be modified by setting the property to a different value.

For example, the `placeholder` below is reflected into _domxref("HTMLInputElement.placeholder"_).

Considering the following HTML:

```html
<input placeholder="Original placeholder" />
```

We can check the reflection between _domxref("HTMLInputElement.placeholder"_) and the attribute using:

```js
let input = document.getElementsByTagName('input')[0];
let attr = input.getAttributeNode('placeholder');
console.log(attr.value);
console.log(input.placeholder); //Returns the same value as `attr.value`
```

and

```js
let input2 = document.getElementsByTagName('input')[0];
let attr2 = input.getAttributeNode('placeholder');
console.log(attr2.value); // Returns `Original placeholder`
input2.placeholder = 'Modified placeholder'; // Also change the value of the reflected attribute.
console.log(attr2.value); // Returns `Modified placeholder`
```

---

> **Base64** is a group of similar [binary-to-text encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding) schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The term _Base64_ originates from a specific [MIME content transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Content-Transfer-Encoding).

Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with ASCII. This is to ensure that the data remain intact without modification during transport. Base64 is commonly used in a number of applications including email via [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME), and storing complex data in [XML](/en-US/docs/Web/XML).

One common application of Base64 encoding on the web is to encode binary data so it can be included in a [data: URL](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs).

In JavaScript there are two functions respectively for decoding and encoding Base64 strings:

- [`btoa()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/btoa): creates a Base64-encoded ASCII string from a "string" of binary data ("btoa" should be read as "binary to ASCII").
- [`atob()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/atob): decodes a Base64-encoded string("atob" should be read as "ASCII to binary").

The algorithm used by `atob()` and `btoa()` is specified in [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648), section 4.

Note that `btoa()` expects to be passed binary data, and will throw an exception if the given string contains any characters whose UTF-16 representation occupies more than one byte. For more details, see the documentation for [`btoa()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/btoa).

## Encoded size increase

Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data. So, three 8-bits bytes of the input string/binary file (3×8 bits = 24 bits) can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits (4×6 = 24 bits).

This means that the Base64 version of a string or file will be at least 133% the size of its source (a \~33% increase). The increase may be larger if the encoded data is small. For example, the string `"a"` with `length === 1` gets encoded to `"YQ=="` with `length === 4` — a 300% increase.

## The "Unicode Problem"

Since [`DOMString`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString '/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString')s are 16-bit-encoded strings, in most browsers calling `window.btoa` on a Unicode string will cause a `Character Out Of Range` exception if a character exceeds the range of a 8-bit ASCII-encoded character. There are two possible methods to solve this problem:

- the first one is to escape the whole string and then encode it;
- the second one is to convert the UTF-16 [`DOMString`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString '/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString') to an UTF-8 array of characters and then encode it.

Here are the two possible methods.

### Solution #1 - escaping the string before encoding it

---


```js


function utf8_to_b64(str) {
    return window.btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(str)));
}

function b64_to_utf8(str) {
    return decodeURIComponent(escape(window.atob(str)));
}

// Usage:
utf8_to_b64('✓ à la mode'); // "4pyTIMOgIGxhIG1vZGU="
b64_to_utf8('4pyTIMOgIGxhIG1vZGU='); // "✓ à la mode"
```

This solution has been proposed by [Johan Sundström](http://ecmanaut.blogspot.com/2006/07/encoding-decoding-utf8-in-javascript.html).

Another possible solution without utilizing the now deprecated 'unescape' and 'escape' functions.

```js

### Appendix: Decode a Base64 string to Uint8Array or ArrayBuffer

These function let us to create also [uint8Arrays](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) or [arrayBuffers](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) from Base64-encoded strings:

```js
// "Base 64 \u2014 Mozilla Developer Network"
var myArray = base64DecToArr('QmFzZSA2NCDigJQgTW96aWxsYSBEZXZlbG9wZXIgTmV0d29yaw==');

// "Base 64 \u2014 Mozilla Developer Network"
var myBuffer = base64DecToArr('QmFzZSA2NCDigJQgTW96aWxsYSBEZXZlbG9wZXIgTmV0d29yaw==').buffer;

alert(myBuffer.byteLength);
```

> **Note:** The function `base64DecToArr(sBase64[, nBlocksSize])` returns an [`uint8Array`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) of bytes. If your aim is to build a buffer of 16-bit / 32-bit / 64-bit raw data, use the `nBlocksSize` argument, which is the number of bytes of which the `uint8Array.buffer.bytesLength` property must result a multiple (`1` or omitted for ASCII, [binary strings](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString/Binary) or UTF-8-encoded strings, `2` for UTF-16 strings, `4` for UTF-32 strings).

## Term: Block cipher mode of operation

- Security

---

> A block cipher mode of operation, usually just called a "mode" in context, specifies how a block cipher should be used to encrypt or decrypt messages that are longer than the block size.

Most symmetric-key algorithms currently in use are block ciphers: this means that they encrypt data a block at a time. The size of each block is fixed and determined by the algorithm: for example AES uses 16-byte blocks. Block ciphers are always used with a _mode_, which specifies how to securely encrypt messages that are longer than the block size. For example, AES is a cipher, while CTR, CBC, and GCM are all modes. Using an inappropriate mode, or using a mode incorrectly, can completely undermine the security provided by the underlying cipher.

## Term: Boolean

- Glossary
- JavaScript

- data types

---

> In computer science, a **Boolean** is a logical data type that can have only the values `true` or `false`.

For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in [if statements](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)) or repeat (such as in [for loops](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)).

Below is some JavaScript pseudocode (it's not truly executable code) demonstrating this concept.

```js
/* JavaScript if statement */
if (boolean conditional) {
   // code to execute if the conditional is true
}

if (boolean conditional) {
  console.log("boolean conditional resolved to true");
} else {
  console.log("boolean conditional resolved to false");
}

/* JavaScript for loop */
for (control variable; boolean conditional; counter) {
  // code to execute repeatedly if the conditional is true
}

for (var i=0; i < 4; i++) {
  console.log("I print only when the boolean conditional is true");
}
```

The Boolean value is named after English mathematician _interwiki("wikipedia", "George Boole"_), who pioneered the field of mathematical logic.

> A **breadcrumb**, or breadcrumb trail, is a navigational aid that is typically placed between a site's header and the main content, displaying either a hierarchy of the current page in relation to the site's structure, from top level to current page, or a list of the links the user followed to get to the current page, in the order visited.

A location breadcrumb for this document might look something like this:

[MDN](/) > [Glossary](/en-US/docs/Glossary) > Breadcrumb

Breadcrumb trails enable users to be aware of their location within a website. This type of navigation, if done correctly, helps users know where they are in a site and how they got there. They can also help a user get back to where they were before and can reduce the number of clicks needed to get to a higher-level page.

## Term: Brotli

---

> **Brotli** is a general-purpose lossless compression algorithm.

It compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and second-order context modeling, providing a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods. Brotli provides better compression ratios than _glossary("GZip_compression", "gzip"_) and deflate speeds are comparable, but brotli compressing is a slower process than Gzip compression, so gzip may be a better option for the compression of non-_glossary("Cache", "cacheable"_) content.

Brotli is compatible with most modern browsers, but you may want to consider a fallback.

> A **browsing context** is the environment in which a browser displays a _domxref("Document"_). In modern browsers, it usually is a _tab_, but can be a _window_ or even only parts of a page, like a _frame_ or an _iframe_.

Each browsing context has a specific origin, the origin of the active document and a history that memorize all the displayed documents, in order.

Communication between browsing context is severely constrained. Between browsing context of the same origin, a _domxref("BroadcastChannel"_) can be opened and used.

- Graphics

---

> A **Bézier curve** (pronounced \[bezje]) is a mathematically described curve used in computer graphics and animation. In _Glossary("vector image", "vector images"_), they are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely.

The curve is defined by a set of control points with a minimum of two. Web related graphics and animations use Cubic Béziers, which are curves with four control points P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>3</sub>.

To draw the curve, two imaginary lines are drawn, one from P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>1</sub> and the other from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>. The end points of the lines are then steadily moved to the next point. A third imaginary line is drawn with its starting point moving steadily on the first helper line and the end point on the second helper line. On this imaginary line a point is drawn from its starting point moving steadily to its end point. The curve this point describes is the Bézier curve. Here's an animated illustration demonstrating the creation of the curve:

## Term: Cacheable

- Glossary
- WebMechanics

---

> A **cacheable** response is an HTTP response that can be cached, that is stored to be retrieved and used later, saving a new request to the server. Not all HTTP responses can be cached, these are the following constraints for an HTTP response to be cached:

- The method used in the request is itself _cacheable_, that is either a _HTTPMethod("GET"_) or a _HTTPMethod("HEAD"_) method. A response to a _HTTPMethod("POST"_) or _HTTPMethod("PATCH"_) request can also be cached if freshness is indicated and the _HTTPHeader("Content-Location"_) header is set, but this is rarely implemented. (For example, Firefox does not support it per <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109553>.) Other methods, like _HTTPMethod("PUT"_) or _HTTPMethod("DELETE"_) are not cacheable and their result cannot be cached.
- The status code of the response is _known_ by the application caching, and it is considered _cacheable_. The following status code are cacheable: _HTTPStatus("200"_), _HTTPStatus("203"_), _HTTPStatus("204"_), _HTTPStatus("206"_), _HTTPStatus("300"_), _HTTPStatus("301"_), _HTTPStatus("404"_), _HTTPStatus("405"_), _HTTPStatus("410"_), _HTTPStatus("414"_), and _HTTPStatus("501"_).
- There are _specific headers_ in the response, like _HTTPHeader("Cache-Control"_), that prevents caching.

Note that some non-cacheable requests/responses to a specific URI may invalidate previously cached responses on the same URI. For example, a _HTTPMethod("PUT"_) to pageX.html will invalidate all cached _HTTPMethod("GET"_) or _HTTPMethod("HEAD"_) requests to the same URI.

When both, the method of the request and the status of the response, are cacheable, the response to the request can be cached:

```plain
GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
(…)

200 OK
(…)
```

A _HTTPMethod("PUT"_) request cannot be cached. Moreover, it invalidates cached data for request to the same URI done via _HTTPMethod("HEAD"_) or _HTTPMethod("GET"_):

```plain
PUT /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
(…)

200 OK
(…)
```

A specific _HTTPHeader("Cache-Control"_) header in the response can prevent caching:

```plain
GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
(…)

200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache
(…)
```

## Term: Call stack

- Call Stack
- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- JavaScript

---

> A **call stack** is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple _glossary("function","functions"_) — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

## Example

---


```js


function greeting() {
    // [1] Some code here
    sayHi();
    // [2] Some code here
}
function sayHi() {
    return 'Hi!';
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some code here
```

The code above would be executed like this:

1.  Ignore all functions, until it reaches the `greeting()` function invocation.
2.  Add the `greeting()` function to the call stack list.

    > **Note:** Call stack list:
    > \- greeting

3.  Execute all lines of code inside the `greeting()` function.
4.  Get to the `sayHi()` function invocation.
5.  Add the `sayHi()` function to the call stack list.

    > **Note:** Call stack list:
    > \- sayHi
    > \- greeting

6.  Execute all lines of code inside the `sayHi()` function, until reaches its end.
7.  Return execution to the line that invoked `sayHi()` and continue executing the rest of the `greeting()` function.
8.  Delete the `sayHi()` function from our call stack list.

    > **Note:** Call stack list:
    > \- greeting

9.  When everything inside the `greeting()` function has been executed, return to its invoking line to continue executing the rest of the JS code.
10. Delete the `greeting()` function from the call stack list.

    > **Note:** Call stack list:
    > EMPTY

In summary, then, we start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.

## Term: Callback function

- Callback
- Callback function
- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

Here is a quick example:

---


```js


function greeting(name) {
    alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
    var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
    callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);
```

The above example is a _glossary("synchronous"_) callback, as it is executed immediately.

Note, however, that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an _glossary("asynchronous"_) operation has completed — these are called asynchronous callbacks. A good example is the callback functions executed inside a [`.then()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) block chained onto the end of a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects. This structure is used in many modern web APIs, such as [`fetch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch).

## Term: Canonical order

- Canonical order
- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> In CSS, canonical order is used to refer to the order in which separate values need to be specified (or _Glossary("parse", "parsed"_)) or are to be _Glossary("serialization", "serialized"_) as part of a CSS property value. It is defined by the formal _Glossary("syntax"_) of the property and normally refers to the order in which longhand values should be specified as part of a single shorthand value.

For example, _cssxref("background"_) shorthand property values are made up of several `background-*` longhand properties. The canonical order of those longhand values is defined as

1.  _cssxref("background-image"_)
2.  _cssxref("background-position"_)
3.  _cssxref("background-size"_)
4.  _cssxref("background-repeat"_)
5.  _cssxref("background-attachment"_)
6.  _cssxref("background-origin"_)
7.  _cssxref("background-clip"_)
8.  _cssxref("background-color"_)

Furthermore, its syntax defines, that if a value for the _cssxref("background-size"_) is given, it **must** be specified **after** the value for the _cssxref("background-position"_), separated by a slash. Other values may appear in any order.

---

> A **caret** (sometimes called a "text cursor") is an indicator displayed on the screen to indicate where text input will be inserted.

Most user interfaces represent the caret using a thin vertical line or a character-sized box that flashes, but this can vary. This point in the text is called the **insertion point**. The word "caret" differentiates the text insertion point from the mouse cursor.

On the web, a caret is used to represent the insertion point in _HTMLElement("input"_) and _HTMLElement("textarea"_) elements, as well as any elements whose _htmlattrxref("contenteditable"_) attribute is set, thereby allowing the contents of the element to be edited by the user.

#### See also

- _interwiki("wikipedia", "Caret navigation"_) on Wikipedia

### CSS related to the caret

You can set the color of the caret for a given element's editable content by setting the element's CSS _cssxref("caret-color"_) property to the appropriate _cssxref("&lt;color&gt;"_) value.

### HTML elements that may present a caret

These elements provide text entry fields or boxes and therefore make use of the caret.

## Term: CDN

- Glossary

---

> A **CDN** (Content Delivery Network) is a group of servers spread out over many locations. These servers store duplicate copies of data so that servers can fulfill data requests based on which servers are closest to the respective end-users. CDNs make for fast service less affected by high traffic.

CDNs are used widely for delivering stylesheets and Javascript files (static assets) of libraries like Bootstrap, jQuery etc. Using CDN for those library files is preferable for a number of reasons:

- Serving libraries' static assets over CDN lowers the request burden on an organization's own servers.
- Most CDNs have servers all over the globe, so CDN servers may be geographically nearer to your users than your own servers. Geographical distance affects latency proportionally.
- CDNs are already configured with proper cache settings. Using a CDN saves further configuration for static assets on your own servers.

For a website digital certificate, this information minimally includes the name of the organization that requested the digital certificate (e.g., Mozilla Corporation), the site that it is for (e.g., mozilla.org), and the certificate authority.

Certificate authorities are the part of the Internet [public key infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure) that allows browsers to verify website identity and securely connect over SSL (and HTTPS).

> **Note:** Web browsers come preloaded with a list of "root certificates". The browser can use these to reliably check that the website certificate was signed by a certificate authority that "chains back" to the root certificate (i.e. was trusted by the owner of the root certificate or an intermediate CA). Ultimately this process relies on every CA performing adequate identity checks before signing a certificate!

## Term: Character encoding

- Composing
- Glossary

---

> An encoding defines a mapping between bytes and text. A sequence of bytes allows for different textual interpretations. By specifying a particular encoding (such as UTF-8), we specify how the sequence of bytes is to be interpreted.

For example, in HTML we normally declare a character encoding of UTF-8, using the following line:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8" />
```

This ensures that you can use characters from just about any human language in your HTML document, and they will display reliably.

In earlier times, countries developed their own character sets due to their different languages used, such as Kanji JIS codes (e.g. Shift-JIS, EUC-JP, etc.) for Japanese, Big5 for traditional Chinese, and KOI8-R for Russian. However, _Glossary("Unicode"_) gradually became most acceptable character set for its universal language support.

If a character set is used incorrectly (For example, Unicode for an article encoded in Big5), you may see nothing but broken characters, which are called _Interwiki("wikipedia", "Mojibake"_).

In a _Glossary("cryptosystem"_) like _Glossary("TLS"_), the client and server must agree on a cipher suite before they can begin communicating securely. A typical cipher suite looks like ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 or ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, indicating:

- ECDHE (elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral) for key exchange
- RSA for authentication
- AES-128 as the cipher, with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as the block cipher mode of operation
- SHA-256 as the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC)

> In _glossary("cryptography"_), a **cipher** is an algorithm that can _glossary("encryption", "encode"_) _glossary("Plaintext"_) to make it unreadable, and to _glossary("decryption", "decode"_) it back.

Ciphers were common long before the information age (e.g., [substitution ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher), [transposition ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher), and [permutation ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_cipher)), but none of them were cryptographically secure except for the [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad).

Modern ciphers are designed to withstand _glossary("attack", "attacks"_) discovered by a _glossary("cryptanalysis", "cryptanalyst"_). There is no guarantee that all attack methods have been discovered, but each algorithm is judged against known classes of attacks.

Ciphers operate two ways, either as [block ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher) on successive blocks, or buffers, of data, or as [stream ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher) on a continuous data flow (often of sound or video).

They also are classified according to how their _glossary("key", "keys"_) are handled:

- [symmetric key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_key_algorithm) algorithms use the same key to encode and decode a message. The key also must be sent securely if the message is to stay confidential.
- [asymmetric key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_key_algorithm) algorithms use a different key for encryption and decryption.

## Term: Code point

- Glossary

---

> A _code point_ is a number assigned to represent an abstract character in a system for representing text (such as Unicode). In Unicode, a code point is expressed in the form "U+1234" where "1234" is the assigned number. For example, the character "A" is assigned a code point of U+0041.

Character encoding forms, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, determine how a Unicode code point should be encoded as a sequence of bytes. Different encoding forms may encode the same code point as different byte sequences: for example, the Cyrillic character "Ф", whose code point is U+0424, is encoded as `0xd0a4` in UTF-8 and as `0x0424` in UTF-16.

## Term: Code splitting

- Glossary
- Reference
- Web Performance
- code splitting
- latency

---

> **Code splitting** is the splitting of code into various bundles or components which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel.

As an application grows in complexity or is maintained, CSS and JavaScripts files or bundles grow in byte size, especially as the number and size of included third-party libraries increases. To prevent the requirement of downloading ginormous files, scripts can be split into multiple smaller files. Then features required at page load can be downloaded immediately with additional scripts being [lazy loaded](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Lazy_load) after the page or application is interactive, thus improving performance. While the total amount of code is the same (and perhaps even a few bytes larger), the amount of code needed during initial load can be reduced.

Code splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.

## Term: Code unit

- Glossary

---

> A _code unit_ is the basic component used by a character encoding system (such as UTF-8 or UTF-16). A character encoding system uses one or more code units to encode a Unicode _Glossary("code point"_).

In UTF-16 (the encoding system used for JavaScript strings) code units are 16-bit values. This means that operations such as indexing into a string or getting the length of a string operate on these 16-bit units. These units do not always map 1-1 onto what we might consider characters.

For example, sometimes characters with diacritics such as accents are represented using two Unicode code points:

```js
const myString = 'ñ';
myString.length;
// 2
```

Also, since not all of the code points defined by Unicode fit into 16 bits, many Unicode code points are encoded as a pair of UTF-16 code units, which is called a _surrogate pair_:

```js
const face = '🥵';
face.length;
// 2
```

The _jsxref("String/codePointAt", "codePointAt()"_) method of the JavaScript _jsxref("String"_) object enables you to retrieve the Unicode code point from its encoded form:

```js
const face = '🥵';
face.codePointAt(0);
// 129397

## Term: Compile

- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> **Compiling** is the process of transforming a computer program written in a given _Glossary("computer programming", "language"_) into a set of instructions in another format or language. A **compiler** is a computer program to execute that task.

Typically, a compiler transforms code written in a higher-level language such as [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) or [Rust](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)>) or [Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>) into executable (runnable) code — so-called **binary code** or **machine code**. [WebAssembly](/en-US/docs/WebAssembly), for example, is a form of executable binary code that [can be compiled from code written in C++, Rust, C#, Go, Swift, and several other languages](https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/) and that can then be run on any web page, in any browser.

Most compilers perform either ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation or just-in-time (JIT) compilation.

The GNU `gcc` compiler is one well-known example of an AOT compiler. AOT compilers are typically invoked from the command line in a shell environment (from within a terminal or console) or within an _Glossary("IDE"_).

JIT compilers are typically not invoked directly but are instead built into software runtimes internally, for the purpose of improving performance. For example, all major browsers now use JavaScript engines that have built-in JIT compilers.

Compilers may also translate among higher-level languages — for example, from TypeScript to _Glossary("JavaScript"_) — in which case, they are often sometimes referred to as **transpilers**.

- Programming Language
- programming

---

> Computer programming is a process of composing and organizing a collection of instructions. These tell a computer/software program what to do in a language which the computer understands. These instructions come in the form of many different languages such as C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Ruby, and Rust.

Using an appropriate language, you can program/create all sorts of software. For example, a program that helps scientists with complex calculations, a database that stores huge amounts of data, a web site that allows people to download music, or animation software that allows people to create animated movies.

## Term: Conditional

- Beginner

- Glossary

---

> A **condition** is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not.

An instruction or a set of instructions is executed if a specific condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction, or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet fulfilled.

> A constant is a value that the programmer cannot change, for example numbers (1, 2, 42). With _glossary("variable","variables"_), on the other hand, the programmer can assign a new _glossary("value"_) to a variable name already in use.

Like variables, some constants are bound to identifiers. For example, the identifier `pi` could be bound to the value 3.14... .

## Term: Constructor

- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> A **constructor** belongs to a particular class _glossary("object"_) that is instantiated. The constructor initializes this object and can provide access to its private information. The concept of a constructor can be applied to most _glossary("OOP","object-oriented programming"_) languages. Essentially, a constructor in _glossary("JavaScript"_) is usually declared at the instance of a _glossary("class"_).

## Syntax

```js
// This is a generic default constructor class Default
function Default() {
}

// This is an overloaded constructor class Overloaded
// with parameter arguments
function Overloaded(arg1, arg2, ..., argN){
}
```

To call the constructor of the class in JavaScript, use a `new` operator to assign a new _glossary("object reference"_) to a _glossary("variable"_).

---


```js


function Default() {}

// A new reference of a Default object assigned to a
// local variable defaultReference
var defaultReference = new Default();
```

## Term: Continuous Media

- Glossary
- Media

---

> Continuous media is data where there is a timing relationship between source and destination. The most common examples of continuous media are audio and motion video. Continuous media can be real-time (interactive), where there is a "tight" timing relationship between source and sink, or streaming (playback), where the relationship is less strict.

CSS can be used in a variety of contexts, including print media. And some CSS, particularly those that are used for layout, behave differently depending on the context they are in.

Continuous Media, therefore, identifies a context where the content is not broken up. It flows continuously. Web content displayed on a screen is continuous media, as is spoken content.

---

## Term: Control flow

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- JavaScript

---

> The _control flow_ is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a _Glossary("Conditional", "conditional"_) structure or `if...else`, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:

    if (field==empty) {
        promptUser();
    } else {
        submitForm();
    }

A typical script in _glossary("JavaScript"_) or _glossary("PHP"_) (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, _Glossary("Loop", "loops"_) and _Glossary("Function", "functions"_). Parts of a script may also be set to execute when _Glossary("Event", "events"_) occur.

For example, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the **Submit** button for the form. The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the `if` and `else` sections, the lines `promptUser` and `submitForm` could also be calls to other functions in the script. As you can see, control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code.

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

## Term: CORS-safelisted request header

- CORS
- Fetch

---

> A [CORS-safelisted request header](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-request-header) is one of the following [HTTP headers](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers):

- _HTTPHeader("Accept"_),
- _HTTPHeader("Accept-Language"_),
- _HTTPHeader("Content-Language"_),
- _HTTPHeader("Content-Type"_).

When containing only these headers (and values that meet the additional requirements laid out below), a requests doesn't need to send a _glossary("preflight request"_) in the context of [CORS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS).

You can safelist more headers using the _HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers"_) header and also list the above headers there to circumvent the following additional restrictions:

#### Additional restrictions

CORS-safelisted headers must also fulfill the following requirements in order to be a CORS-safelisted request header:

- For _HTTPHeader("Accept-Language"_) and _HTTPHeader("Content-Language"_): can only have values consisting of `0-9`, `A-Z`, `a-z`, space or `*,-.;=`.
- For _HTTPHeader("Accept"_) and _HTTPHeader("Content-Type"_): can't contain a _CORS-unsafe request header byte_: `0x00-0x1F` (except for `0x09 (HT)`, which is allowed), `"():<>?@[\]{}`, and `0x7F (DEL)`.
- For _HTTPHeader("Content-Type"_): needs to have a MIME type of its parsed value (ignoring parameters) of either `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`.
- For any header: the value's length can't be greater than 128.

---

> A _CORS-safelisted response header_ is an [HTTP header](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) in a [CORS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) response that it is considered _safe_ to expose to client scripts. Only safelisted response headers are made available to web pages.

By default, the safelist includes the following response headers:

- _HTTPHeader("Cache-Control"_)
- _HTTPHeader("Content-Language"_)
- _HTTPHeader("Content-Length"_)
- _HTTPHeader("Content-Type"_)
- _HTTPHeader("Expires"_)
- _HTTPHeader("Last-Modified"_)
- _HTTPHeader("Pragma"_)

Additional headers can be added to the safelist using _HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Expose-Headers"_).

> **Note:** _HTTPHeader("Content-Length"_) was not part of the original set of safelisted response headers \[[ref](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/626)]

## Examples

### Extending the safelist

You can extend the list of CORS-safelisted response headers by using the _HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Expose-Headers"_) header:

---

> Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject into a website malicious client-side code. This code is executed by the victims and lets the attackers bypass access controls and impersonate users. According to the Open Web Application Security Project, XSS was the [seventh most common Web app vulnerability](<https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)>) in 2017.

These attacks succeed if the Web app does not employ enough validation or encoding. The user's browser cannot detect the malicious script is untrustworthy, and so gives it access to any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive site-specific information, or lets the malicious script rewrite the _glossary("HTML"_) content.

![The cross axis runs down the column](basics3.png)

If your main axis is `column` or `column-reverse` then the cross axis runs along the rows.

![The cross axis runs along the row.](basics4.png)

Alignment of items on the cross axis is achieved with the `align-items` property on the flex container or `align-self` property on individual items. In the case of a multi-line flex container, with additional space on the cross axis, you can use `align-content` to control the spacing of the rows.

## Term: Cryptographic hash function

> A cryptographic hash function, also sometimes called a _digest function_, is a _glossary("cryptography", "cryptographic"_) primitive transforming a message of arbitrary size into a message of fixed size, called a _glossary("digest"_). Cryptographic hash functions are used for authentication, _Glossary("digital signature", "digital signatures"_), and _Glossary("HMAC", "message authentication codes"_).

To be used for cryptography, a hash function must have these qualities:

- quick to compute (because they are generated frequently)
- not invertible (each digest could come from a very large number of messages, and only brute-force can generate a message that leads to a given digest)
- tamper-resistant (any change to a message leads to a different digest)
- collision-resistant (it should be impossible to find two different messages that produce the same digest)

Cryptographic hash functions such as MD5 and SHA-1 are considered broken, as attacks have been found that significantly reduce their collision resistance.

```html
<img src="https://www.example.com/index.php?action=delete&id=123" />
```

For users who have modification permissions on `https://www.example.com`, the `<img>` element executes action on `https://www.example.com` without their noticing, even if the element is not at `https://www.example.com`.

There are many ways to prevent CSRF, such as implementing _glossary("REST", "RESTful API"_), adding secure tokens, etc.

## Term: Selector (CSS)

- Glossary
- HTML
- Selector

---

> A **CSS selector** is the part of a CSS rule that describes what elements in a document the rule will match. The matching elements will have the rule's specified style applied to them.

## Example

Consider this CSS:

```css
p {
    color: green;
}

div.warning {
    width: 100%;
    border: 2px solid yellow;
    color: white;
    background-color: darkred;
    padding: 0.8em 0.8em 0.6em;
}

#customized {
    font: 16px Lucida Grande, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

The selectors here are `"p"` (which applies the color green to the text inside any _HTMLElement("p"_) element), `"div.warning"` (which makes any _HTMLElement("div"_) element with the _Glossary("CSS class", "class"_) `"warning"` look like a warning box), and `"#customized"`, which sets the base font of the element with the ID `"customized"` to 16-pixel tall Lucida Grande or one of a few fallback fonts.

We can then apply this CSS to some HTML, such as:

```html
<p>This is happy text.</p>

<div class="warning">Be careful! There are wizards present, and they are quick to anger!</div>

<div id="customized">
    <p>This is happy text.</p>

    <div class="warning">Be careful! There are wizards present, and they are quick to anger!</div>
</div>
```

- Media

---

> In the context of _Glossary("CSS"_) (Cascading Style Sheets), the term **_media_** refers to the destination to which the document is to be drawn by the _Glossary("rendering engine"_).

Typically, this is a screen—but it may also be a printer, Braille display, or another type of device.

CSS offers several features that allow you to tweak your document's styles—or even offer different styles—according to the media **type** (such as screen or print, to name two) or media **capabilities** (such as width, resolution, or other values) of the viewer's device.

---

> A **database** is a storing system that collects organized data, to make some works easier like searching, structure, and extend.

In web development, most databases use the relational database management system (RDBMS) to organize data and programming in _glossary("SQL"_). Some databases, however, don't follow the former mechanism to organized data, which called NoSQL.

Some famous server-side RDBMS are _MySQL_(or _MariaDB_ which is a fork of it), _SQL Server_, and _Oracle Database_. On the other hand, some famous NoSQL examples are _MongoDB_, _Cassandra_, and _Redis_.

Browsers also have their own database system called _glossary("IndexedDB"_).

## Term: Decryption

- Cryptography
- Glossary

---

> In _glossary("cryptography"_), **decryption** is the conversion of _glossary("ciphertext"_) into _glossary("Plaintext"_).

Decryption is a cryptographic primitive: it transforms a ciphertext message into plaintext using a cryptographic algorithm called a _glossary("cipher"_). Like encryption, decryption in modern ciphers is performed using a specific algorithm and a secret, called the _glossary("key"_). Since the algorithm is often public, the key must stay secret if the encryption stays secure.

![The decryption primitive.](decryption.png)

Decryption is the reverse of _glossary("encryption"_) and if the key stays secret, decryption without knowing the specific secret, decryption is mathematically hard to perform. How hard depends on the security of the cryptographic algorithm chosen and evolves with the progress of _glossary("cryptanalysis"_).

## Term: Delta

- Delta
- Glossary
- difference
- value

---

> The term **delta** refers to the difference between two values or states.

The name originates from the Greek letter Δ (delta), which is equivalent to the letter _D_ in the Roman alphabet. _Delta_ refers to the use of the letter Δ as a shorthand for _difference_.

The term _delta_ is commonly used when communicating changes in speed, position, or acceleration of a physical or virtual object. It's also used when describing changes in the volume or frequency of sound waves.

For example, when describing how far an object on the screen moves left-to-right, one might use the term _delta x_ or _Δx_.

Likewise, given the new value of _X_ and its old value, you might compute the delta like this:

```js
let deltaX = newX - oldX;
```

More commonly, you receive the delta and use it to update a saved previous condition:

```js
let newX = oldX + deltaX;
```

#### See also

- Mouse wheel events (_domxref("WheelEvent"_) offer the amount the wheel moved since the last event in its _domxref("WheelEvent.deltaX", "deltaX"_), _domxref("WheelEvent.deltaY", "deltaY"_), and _domxref("WheelEvent.deltaZ", "deltaZ"_) properties, for example.

## Term: Digest

---

> A **digest** is a small value generated by a _glossary("cryptographic hash function", "hash function"_) from a whole message. Ideally, a digest is quick to calculate, irreversible, and unpredictable, and therefore indicates whether someone has tampered with a given message.

A digest can be used to perform several tasks:

- in non-cryptographic applications (e.g., the index of hash tables, or a fingerprint used to detect duplicate data or to uniquely identify files)
- verify message integrity (a tampered message will have a different hash)
- store passwords so that they can't be retrieved, but can still be checked (To do this securely, you also need to salt the password.)
- generate pseudo-random numbers
- generate _glossary("key","keys"_)

It is critical to choose the proper hash function for your use case to avoid collisions and predictability.

## Term: Distributed Denial of Service

- Attack
- DDoS
- Denial of Service
- Glossary
- Intro
- Security

---

> A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) is an attack in which many compromised systems are made to attack a single target, in order to swamp server resources and block legitimate users.

Normally many persons, using many bots, attack high-profile Web _glossary("server","servers"_) like banks or credit-card payment gateways. DDoS concerns computer networks and CPU resource management.

In a typical DDoS attack, the assailant begins by exploiting a vulnerability in one computer system and making it the DDoS master. The attack master, also known as the botmaster, identifies and infects other vulnerable systems with malware. Eventually, the assailant instructs the controlled machines to launch an attack against a specified target.

There are two types of DDoS attacks: a network-centric attack (which overloads a service by using up bandwidth) and an application-layer attack (which overloads a service or database with application calls). The overflow of data to the target causes saturation in the target machine so that it cannot respond or responds very slowly to legitimate traffic (hence the name "denial of service"). The infected computers' owners normally don't know that their computers have been compromised, and they also suffer loss of service.

A computer under an intruder's control is called a zombie or bot. A network of co-infected computers is known as a botnet or a zombie army. Both Kaspersky Labs and Symantec have identified botnets -- not spam, viruses, or worms -- as the biggest threat to Internet security.

The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) defines symptoms of denial-of-service attacks to include:

- Unusually slow network performance (opening files or accessing websites)
- Unavailability of a particular website
- Inability to access any website
- Dramatic increase in the number of spam emails received—(this type of DoS attack is considered an email bomb)
- Disconnection of a wireless or wired internet connection
- Longterm denial of access to the Web or any internet services

> **DNS** (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for Internet connected resources. DNS maintains a list of _Glossary("domain name","domain names"_) along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them.

The most prominent function of DNS is the translation of human-friendly domain names (such as mozilla.org) to a numeric _Glossary("IP address"_) (such as 151.106.5.172); this process of mapping a domain name to the appropriate IP address is known as a **DNS lookup**. By contrast, a **reverse DNS lookup** (rDNS) is used to determine the domain name associated with an IP address.

## Term: Domain sharding

- DNS
- Glossary
- HTTP
- Reference
- Web Performance
- latency

---

> Browsers limit the number of active connections for each domain. To enable concurrent downloads of assets exceeding that limit, **domain sharding** splits content across multiple subdomains. When multiple domains are used to serve multiple assets, browsers are able to download more resources simultaneously, resulting in a faster page load time and improved user experience.

The problem with domain sharding, in terms of performance, is the cost of extra DNS lookups for each domain and the overhead of establishing each TCP connection.

The initial response from an HTTP request is generally an HTML file listing other resources such as JavaScript, CSS, images and other media files that need to be downloaded. As browsers limit the number of active connections per domain, serving all the required resources from a single domain could be slow as assets need to be downloaded sequentially. With domain sharding, the required downloads are served from more than one domain, enabling the browser to simultaneously download needed resources. Multiple domains, however, is an anti-pattern, as DNS lookups slow initial load times.

HTTP2 supports unlimited concurrent requests making domain sharding an obsolete requirement when HTTP/2 is enabled.

## Term: Domain

---

> A domain is an authority within the internet that controls its own resources. Its "domain name" is a way to address this authority as part of the hierarchy in a _Glossary("URL"_) - usually the most memorable part of it, for instance a brand name.

A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) contains all necessary parts to look up this authority by name unambiguously using the _Glossary("DNS"_) system of the internet.

For example, in "developer.mozilla.org":

1.  "org" is called a _interwiki("wikipedia", "Top-level_domain", "top-level domain"_). They are registered as an internet standard by the _interwiki("wikipedia", "Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority", "IANA"_) . Here, "org" means "organization" which is defined in a top-level _domain registry_.
2.  "mozilla" is the domain. If you like to own a domain you have to register it with one of the many _interwiki("wikipedia", "Domain_name_registrar", "registrars"_) who are allowed to do so with a top-level domain registry.
3.  "developer" is a "sub-domain", something you as the owner of a domain may define yourself. Many owners choose to have a subdomain "www" to point to their _Glossary("World_Wide_Web"_) resource, but that's not required (and has even fallen somewhat out of favor).

## Term: Dominator

> In graph theory, node A dominates node B if every path from the root node to B passes through A.

This concept is important for _Glossary("garbage collection"_) because it means that B is only reachable through A. So if the garbage collector found A to be unreachable and eligible for reclaiming, than B would also be unreachable and eligible for reclaiming. So objects that A dominates contribute to the retained size of A: that is, the total amount of memory that could be freed if A itself were freed.

- CodingScripting
- DOM
- Glossary

---

> The **DOM** (Document Object Model) is an _glossary("API"_) that represents and interacts with any _glossary("HTML"_) or _glossary("XML"_) document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the _glossary("browser"_) and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an _Glossary("element"_), text string, or comment).

The DOM is one of the most-used _Glossary("API"_)s on the _glossary("World Wide Web","Web"_) because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved and changed. Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event.

DOM was not originally specified—it came about when browsers began implementing _Glossary("JavaScript"_). This legacy DOM is sometimes called DOM 0. Today, the WHATWG maintains the DOM Living Standard.

## Term: DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)

- DTLS
- Intro

> **Datagram Transport Layer Security** (**DTLS**) is a protocol used to secure datagram-based communications. It's based on the stream-focused Transport Layer Security (_Glossary("TLS"_)), providing a similar level of security. As a datagram protocol, DTLS doesn't guarantee the order of message delivery, or even that messages will be delivered at all. However, DTLS gains the benefits of datagram protocols, too; in particular, the lower overhead and reduced latency.

These features are especially useful for one of the most common areas in which DTLS comes into play: _Glossary("WebRTC"_). All of the WebRTC related protocols are required to encrypt their communications using DTLS; this includes _Glossary("SCTP"_), _Glossary("RTP", "SRTP"_), and _Glossary("STUN"_).

## Term: Element

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- HTML

---

> An **element** is a part of a webpage. In _glossary("XML"_) and _glossary("HTML"_), an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening tag with some _glossary("attribute", "attributes"_), enclosed text content, and a closing tag.

![Example: in <p class="nice">Hello world!</p>, '<p class="nice">' is an opening tag, 'class="nice"' is an attribute and its value, 'Hello world!' is enclosed text content, and '</p>' is a closing tag.](anatomy-of-an-html-element.png)

## Term: Empty element

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- Intermediate

---

> An **empty element** is an _Glossary("element"_) from HTML, SVG, or MathML that **cannot** have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes).

The [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), [SVG](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/), and [MathML](https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/) specifications define very precisely what each element can contain. Many combinations have no semantic meaning, for example an _HTMLElement("audio"_) element nested inside an _HTMLElement("hr"_) element.

In HTML, using a closing tag on an empty element is usually invalid. For example, `<input type="text"></input>` is invalid HTML.

The empty elements in HTML are as follows:

- _HTMLElement("area"_)
- _HTMLElement("base"_)
- _HTMLElement("br"_)
- _HTMLElement("col"_)
- _HTMLElement("embed"_)
- _HTMLElement("hr"_)
- _HTMLElement("img"_)
- _HTMLElement("input"_)
- _HTMLElement("keygen"_)(HTML 5.2 Draft removed)
- _HTMLElement("link"_)
- _HTMLElement("meta"_)
- _HTMLElement("param"_)
- _HTMLElement("source"_)
- _HTMLElement("track"_)
- _HTMLElement("wbr"_)

## Term: Encapsulation

- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> Encapsulation is the packing of data and _glossary("function","functions"_) into one component (for example, a _glossary("class"_)) and then controlling access to that component to make a "blackbox" out of the _glossary("object"_). Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its interface (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation.

## Term: Encryption

- Cryptography
- Glossary
- Privacy
- Security

---

> In _glossary("cryptography"_), **encryption** is the conversion of _glossary("plaintext"_) into a coded text or _glossary("ciphertext"_). A ciphertext is intended to be unreadable by unauthorized readers.

Encryption is a cryptographic primitive: it transforms a plaintext message into a ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm called a _glossary("cipher"_). Encryption in modern ciphers is performed using a specific algorithm and a secret, called the _glossary("key"_). Since the algorithm is often public, the key must stay secret if the encryption stays secure.

![How encryption works.](encryption.png)

Without knowing the secret, the reverse operation, _glossary("decryption"_), is mathematically hard to perform. How hard depends on the security of the cryptographic algorithm chosen and evolves with the progress of _glossary("cryptanalysis"_).

## Term: Endianness

- Coding
- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> **Endian** and **endianness** (or "byte-order") describe how computers organize the bytes that make up numbers.

Each memory storage location has an index or address. Every byte can store an 8-bit number (i.e. between `0x00` and `0xff`), so you must reserve more than one byte to store a larger number. By far the most common _ordering_ of multiple bytes in one number is the **little-endian**, which is used on all Intel processors. Little-endian means storing bytes in order of least-to-most-significant (where the least significant byte takes the first or lowest address), comparable to a common European way of writing dates (e.g., 31 December 2050).

Naturally, **big-endian** is the opposite order, comparable to an ISO date (2050-12-31). Big-endian is also often called "network byte order", because Internet standards usually require data to be stored big-endian, starting at the standard UNIX socket level and going all the way up to standardized Web binary data structures. Also, older Mac computers using 68000-series and PowerPC microprocessors formerly used big-endian.

Examples with the number `0x12345678` (i.e. 305 419 896 in decimal):

- _little-endian_: `0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12`
- _big-endian_: `0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78`
- _mixed-endian_ (historic and very rare): `0x34 0x12 0x78 0x56`

## Term: Entity header

- Glossary
- WebMechanics

---

> > **Warning:** The current HTTP/1.1 specification no longer refers to entities, entity headers or entity-body. Some of the fields are now referred to as _glossary("Representation header"_) fields.

An entity header is an _glossary("HTTP_header", "HTTP header"_) that describes the payload of an HTTP message (i.e. metadata about the message body). Entity headers include: _HTTPHeader("Content-Length"_), _HTTPHeader("Content-Language"_), _HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding"_), _HTTPHeader("Content-Type"_), _HTTPHeader("Expires"_), etc. Entity headers may be present in both HTTP request and response messages.

In the following example, _HTTPHeader("Content-Length"_) is an entity header, while _HTTPHeader("Host"_) and _HTTPHeader("User-Agent"_) are requests headers:

```plain
POST /myform.html HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Content-Length: 128
```

## Term: Entity

- CodingScripting
- Composing
- Glossary
- HTML

---

> An _glossary("HTML"_) **entity** is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (`&`) and ends with a semicolon (`;`) . Entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are difficult to type with a standard keyboard.

> **Note:** Many characters have memorable entities. For example, the entity for the copyright symbol (`©`) is `&copy;`. For less memorable characters, such as `&#8212;` or `&#x2014;`, you can use a [reference chart](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html#named-character-references) or [decoder tool](https://mothereff.in/html-entities).

## Reserved characters

Some special characters are reserved for use in HTML, meaning that your browser will parse them as HTML code. For example, if you use the less-than (`<`) sign, the browser interprets any text that follows as a _Glossary('tag'_).

To display these characters as text, replace them with their corresponding character entities, as shown in the following table.

| Character | Entity   | Note                                                                        |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &         | `&amp;`  | Interpreted as the beginning of an entity or character reference.           |
| <         | `&lt;`   | Interpreted as the beginning of a _Glossary('tag'_)                         |
| >         | `&gt;`   | Interpreted as the ending of a _Glossary('tag'_)                            |
| "         | `&quot;` | Interpreted as the beginning and end of an _Glossary('attribute'_)'s value. |

## Term: Falsy

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- JavaScript

---

> A **falsy** (sometimes written **falsey**) value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a _Glossary("Boolean"_) context.

_Glossary("JavaScript"_) uses _Glossary("Type_Conversion", "type conversion"_) to coerce any value to a Boolean in contexts that require it, such as _Glossary("Conditional", "conditionals"_) and _Glossary("Loop", "loops"_).

The following table provides a complete list of JavaScript falsy values:

| Value                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `0n`                      | The _jsxref("BigInt"_) zero (so, also `0x0n`). Note that there is no _jsxref("BigInt"_) negative zero — the negation of `0n` is `0n`.                                                                                         |

## Examples

Examples of _falsy_ values in JavaScript (which are coerced to false in Boolean contexts, and thus _bypass_ the `if` block):

```js
if (false)
if (null)
if (undefined)
if (0)
if (-0)
if (0n)
if (NaN)
if ("")
```

### The logical AND operator, &&

If the first object is falsy, it returns that object

```js
false && 'dog';
// ↪ false

0 && 'dog';
// ↪ 0
```

> A favicon (favorite icon) is a tiny icon included along with a website, which is displayed in places like the browser's address bar, page tabs and bookmarks menu.

Note, however, that most modern browsers replaced the favicon from the address bar by an image indicating whether or not the website is using _Glossary("https","HTTPS"_).

Usually, a favicon is 16 x 16 pixels in size and stored in the _Glossary("GIF"_), _Glossary("PNG"_), or ICO file format.

They are used to improve user experience and enforce brand consistency. When a familiar icon is seen in the browser's address bar, for example, it helps users know they are in the right place.

---

> **_Glossary("CSP"_) fetch directives** are used in a _HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy"_) header and control locations from which certain resource types may be loaded. For instance, _CSP("script-src"_) allows developers to allow trusted sources of script to execute on a page, while _CSP("font-src"_) controls the sources of web fonts.

All fetch directives fall back to _CSP("default-src"_). That means, if a fetch directive is absent in the CSP header, the user agent will look for the `default-src` directive.

## Term: Fetch metadata request header

- Fetch Metadata Request Headers
- Glossary

---

> A **fetch metadata request header** is an _Glossary("Request header", "HTTP request header"_) that provides additional information about the context from which the request originated. This allows the server to make decisions about whether a request should be allowed based on where the request came from and how the resource will be used.

With this information a server can implement a _Glossary("resource isolation policy"_), allowing external sites to request only those resources that are intended for sharing, and that are used appropriately. This approach can help mitigate common cross-site web vulnerabilities such as _Glossary("CSRF"_), Cross-site Script Inclusion('XSSI'), timing attacks, and cross-origin information leaks.

These headers are prefixed with `Sec-`, and hence have _Glossary("Forbidden header name", "forbidden header names"_). As such, they cannot be modified from JavaScript.

The fetch metadata request headers are:

- _HTTPHeader("Sec-Fetch-Site"_)
- _HTTPHeader("Sec-Fetch-Mode"_)
- _HTTPHeader("Sec-Fetch-User"_)
- _HTTPHeader("Sec-Fetch-Dest"_)

## Term: First-class Function

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- JavaScript

---

> A programming language is said to have **First-class functions** when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

## Example | Assign a function to a variable

### JavaScript

```js
const foo = function () {
    console.log('foobar');
};
foo(); // Invoke it using the variable
// foobar
```

We assigned an **Anonymous Function** in a _glossary("Variable"_), then we used that variable to invoke the function by adding parentheses `()` at the end.

> **Note:** **Even if your function was named,** you can use the variable name to invoke it. Naming it will be helpful when debugging your code. _But it won't affect the way we invoke it._

## Example | Pass a function as an Argument

### JavaScript

---


```js


function sayHello() {
    return 'Hello, ';
}
function greeting(helloMessage, name) {
    console.log(helloMessage() + name);
}
// Pass `sayHello` as an argument to `greeting` function
greeting(sayHello, 'JavaScript!');
// Hello, JavaScript!
```

We are passing our `sayHello()` function as an argument to the `greeting()` function, this explains how we are treating the function as a **value**.

> **Note:** The function that we pass as an argument to another function, is called a **_glossary("Callback function"_)**. _`sayHello` is a Callback function._

## Example | Return a function

### JavaScript

---


```js


function sayHello() {
    return function () {
        console.log('Hello!');
    };
}
```

In this example; We need to return a function from another function - _We can return a function because we treated function in JavaScript as a **value**._

> **Note:** A function that returns a function is called a **Higher-Order Function**.

Back to our example; Now, we need to invoke `sayHello` function and its returned `Anonymous Function`. To do so, we have two ways:

### 1- Using a variable

```js
const sayHello = function () {
    return function () {
        console.log('Hello!');
    };
};
const myFunc = sayHello();
myFunc();
// Hello!
```

This way, it returns the `Hello!` message.

> **Note:** You have to use another variable. If you invoked `sayHello` directly, it would return the function itself **without invoking its returned function**.

### 2- Using double parentheses

---


```js


function sayHello() {
    return function () {
        console.log('Hello!');
    };
}
sayHello()();
// Hello!
```

We are using double parentheses `()()` to invoke the returned function as well.

> **First Contentful Paint** (FCP) is when the browser renders the first bit of content from the DOM, providing the first feedback to the user that the page is actually loading. The question "Is it happening?" is "yes" when the first contentful paint completes.

_The First Contentful Paint_ time stamp is when the browser first rendered any text, image (including background images), non-white canvas or SVG. This excludes any content of iframes, but includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.

---

> **First CPU Idle** measures when a page is minimally interactive, or when the window is quiet enough to handle user input. It is a non-standard Google web performance metric. Generally, it occurs when most, but not necessarily all visible UI elements are interactive, and the user interface responds, on average, to most user input within 50ms. It is also known as [First interactive](/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_interactive).

## Term: First input delay

- Glossary
- Reference
- Web Performance

---

> **First input delay** (FID) measures the time from when a user first interacts with your site (i.e. when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to respond to that interaction.

It is the length of time, in milliseconds, between the first user interaction on a web page and the browser's response to that interaction. Scrolling and zooming are not included in this metric.

The time between when content is painted to the page and when all the functionality becomes responsive to human interaction often varies based on the size and complexity of the JavaScript needing to be downloaded, parsed, and executed on the main thread, and on the device speed or lack thereof (think low end mobile devices). The longer the delay, the worse the user experience. Reducing site initialization time and eliminating[ long tasks](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Long_Tasks_API) can help eliminate first input delays.

> \_draft}}

**First Interactive,** also known as [first CPU idle](/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_CPU_idle), is a non-standard web performance metric that measures when the user's window is quiet enough to handle user input, or what is termed as minimally interactive.

Minimally interactive is defined as when some, but not necessarily all, UI elements on the page have loaded and are interactive, and, on average, respond to user input in a reasonable amount of time.

## More information

First interactive is a variation of [Time to Interactive](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_interactive), which is split into _First Interactive_ and _Consistently Interactive_. These metrics have been proposed by the Web Incubator Community Group and are already being used in various tools. This metric has been called _First CPU Idle_ since [Lighthouse 3.0](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)

> A _glossary("flexbox"_) layout is defined using the `flex` or `inline-flex` values of the `display` property on the parent item. This element then becomes a **flex container**, and each one of its children becomes a _glossary("flex item"_).

A value of `flex` causes the element to become a block level flex container, and `inline-flex` an inline level flex container. These values create a **flex formatting context** for the element, which is similar to a block formatting context in that floats will not intrude into the container, and the margins on the container will not collapse with those of the items.

> Flexbox is the commonly-used name for the [CSS Flexible Box Layout Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/), a layout model for displaying items in a single dimension — as a row or as a column.

In the specification, Flexbox is described as a layout model for user interface design. The key feature of Flexbox is the fact that items in a flex layout can grow and shrink. Space can be assigned to the items themselves, or distributed between or around the items.

Flexbox also enables alignment of items on the main or cross axis, thus providing a high level of control over the size and alignment of a group of items.

## Term: Flex

---

> `flex` is a new value added to the CSS _cssxref("display"_) property. Along with `inline-flex` it causes the element that it applies to in order to become a _glossary("flex container"_), and the element's children to each become a _glossary("flex item"_). The items then participate in flex layout, and all of the properties defined in the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module may be applied.

The `flex` property is a shorthand for the flexbox properties `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`.

In addition `<flex>` can refer to [a flexible length](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex_value) in CSS Grid Layout.

## Term: Forbidden header name

- Fetch
- Glossary
- HTTP
- Headers
- forbidden

---

> A **forbidden header name** is the name of any [HTTP header](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) that cannot be modified programmatically; specifically, an HTTP **request** header name (in contrast with a _Glossary("Forbidden response header name"_)).

Modifying such headers is forbidden because the user agent retains full control over them. Names starting with `Sec-` are reserved for creating new headers safe from _glossary("API","APIs"_) using [Fetch](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) that grant developers control over headers, such as _domxref("XMLHttpRequest"_).

Forbidden header names start with `Proxy-` or `Sec-`, or are one of the following names:

- `Accept-Charset`
- `Accept-Encoding`
- `Access-Control-Request-Headers`
- `Access-Control-Request-Method`
- `Connection`
- `Content-Length`
- `Cookie`
- `Cookie2`
- `Date`
- `DNT`
- `Expect`
- `Feature-Policy`
- `Host`
- `Keep-Alive`
- `Origin`
- `Proxy-`
- `Sec-`
- `Referer`
- `TE`
- `Trailer`
- `Transfer-Encoding`
- `Upgrade`
- `Via`

> **Note:** The `User-Agent` header is no longer forbidden, [as per spec](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#terminology-headers) — see forbidden header name list (this was implemented in Firefox 43) — it can now be set in a Fetch [Headers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object, or via XHR [setRequestHeader()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#setrequestheader%28%29). However, Chrome will silently drop the header from Fetch requests (see [Chromium bug 571722](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=571722)).

Movies generally have a frame rate of 24 fps. They are able to have fewer frames per second because the illusion of life is created with motion blurs. When moving on a computer screen there are no motion blurs (unless you are animating an image [sprite](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS) with motion blurs).

When breakable content would overflow a fragmentainer in the block dimension, it breaks into the next container in its fragmentation context instead.

Fragmented contexts are found in CSS Paged Media, where the fragmentainer would be the box which defines a page. In Multiple-column Layout the fragmentainer is the column box created when columns are defined on a multicol container. In CSS Regions each Region is a fragmentainer.

## Term: Function

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- IIFE
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
- Intro
- JavaScript

---

> A **function** is a code snippet that can be called by other code or by itself, or a _Glossary("variable"_) that refers to the function. When a function is called, _Glossary("Argument", "arguments"_) are passed to the function as input, and the function can optionally return a value. A function in _glossary("JavaScript"_) is also an _glossary("object"_).

A function name is an _Glossary("identifier"_) included as part of a function declaration or function expression. The function name's _Glossary("scope"_) depends on whether the function name is a declaration or expression.

### Different types of functions

An **anonymous function** is a function without a function name. Only function expressions can be anonymous, function declarations must have a name:

```js
// When used as a function expression
(function () {});
// or using the ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
() => {};
```

The following terms are not used in the ECMAScript language specification, they're jargon used to refer to different types of functions.

A **named function** is a function with a function name:

```js
// Function declaration
function foo() {}
// Named function expression
(function bar() {});
// or using the ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
const foo = () => {};
```

An **inner function** is a function inside another function (`square` in this case). An **outer function** is a function containing a function (`addSquares` in this case):

---


```js


function addSquares(a, b) {
    function square(x) {
        return x * x;
    }
    return square(a) + square(b);
}
//Using ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
const addSquares = (a, b) => {
    const square = (x) => x * x;
    return square(a) + square(b);
};
```

A **recursive function** is a function that calls itself. See _Glossary("Recursion", "recursion"_).

---


```js


function loop(x) {
    if (x >= 10) return;
    loop(x + 1);
}
//Using ECMAScript 2015 arrow notation
const loop = (x) => {
    if (x >= 10) return;
    loop(x + 1);
};
```

An **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions** (_glossary("IIFE"_)) is a function that is called directly after the function is loaded into the browser's compiler. The way to identify an IIFE is by locating the extra left and right parenthesis at the end of the function's definition.

```js
// Declared functions can't be called immediately this way
// Error (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression)
/*
function foo() {
    console.log('Hello Foo');
}();
*/

// Function expressions, named or anonymous, can be called immediately
(function foo() {
    console.log('Hello Foo');
})();

(function food() {
    console.log('Hello Food');
})();

(() => console.log('hello world'))();
```

> **Gecko** is the layout engine developed by the Mozilla Project and used in many apps/devices, including _glossary("Mozilla Firefox","Firefox"_) and _glossary("Firefox OS"_).

Web _glossary("browser","browsers"_) need software called a layout engine to interpret _glossary("HTML"_), _glossary("CSS"_), _glossary("JavaScript"_), and embedded content (like images) and draw everything to your screen. Besides this, Gecko makes sure associated _glossary("API","APIs"_) work well on every operating system Gecko supports, and that appropriate APIs are exposed only to relevant support targets. This means that Gecko includes, among other things, a networking stack, graphics stack, layout engine, a JavaScript virtual machine, and porting layers.

Since all Firefox OS apps are Web apps, Firefox OS uses Gecko as its app runtime as well.

## Term: Global object

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- NeedsContent

---

> A global object is an _glossary("object"_) that always exists in the _glossary("global scope"_).

In JavaScript, there's always a global object defined. In a web browser, when scripts create global variables defined with the [`var`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) keyword, they're created as members of the global object. (In _Glossary("Node.js"_) this is not the case.) The global object's _Glossary("interface"_) depends on the execution context in which the script is running. For example:

- In a web browser, any code which the script doesn't specifically start up as a background task has a _domxref("Window"_) as its global object. This is the vast majority of JavaScript code on the Web.
- Code running in a _domxref("Worker"_) has a _domxref("WorkerGlobalScope"_) object as its global object.
- Scripts running under _Glossary("Node.js"_) have an object called [`global`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global) as their global object.

> **Note**: Unlike _jsxref("Statements/var", "var"_), the statements _jsxref("Statements/let", "let"_) and _jsxref("Statements/const", "const"_) do not create properties of the global object.

## `window` object in the Browser

The `window` object is the Global Object in the Browser. Any Global Variables or Functions can be accessed as _properties_ of the `window` object.

### Access Global Variables

```js
var foo = 'foobar';
foo === window.foo; // Returns: true
```

After defining a Global Variable `foo`, we can access its value directly from the `window` object, by using the variable name `foo` as a property name of the Global Object `window.foo`.

#### Explanation:

The global variable `foo` was stored in the `window` object, like this:

```js
foo: 'foobar';
```

### Access Global Functions

---


```js


function greeting() {
    console.log('Hi!');
}

window.greeting(); // It is the same as the normal invoking: greeting();
```

The example above explains how Global Functions are stored as _properties_ in the `window` object. We created a Global Function called `greeting`, then invoked it using the `window` object.

#### Explanation:

The global function `greeting` was stored in the `window` object, like this:

## Term: Graceful degradation

- graceful degradation

---

> **Graceful degradation** is a design philosophy that centers around trying to build a modern web site/application that will work in the newest browsers, but falls back to an experience that while not as good still delivers essential content and functionality in older browsers.

_Glossary("Polyfill","Polyfills"_) can be used to build in missing features with JavaScript, but acceptable alternatives to features like styling and layout should be provided where possible, for example by using the CSS cascade, or HTML fallback behavior. Some good examples can be found in [Handling common HTML and CSS problems](/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/HTML_and_CSS).

It is a useful technique that allows Web developers to focus on developing the best possible websites, given that those websites are accessed by multiple unknown user-agents. _Glossary("Progressive enhancement"_) is related but different — often seen as going in the opposite direction to graceful degradation. In reality both approaches are valid and can often complement one another.

## Term: Grid Areas

- CSS
- CSS Grids
- Reference

---

> A **grid area** is one or more _glossary("grid cell", "grid cells"_) that make up a rectangular area on the grid. Grid areas are created when you place an item using [line-based placement](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Line-based_Placement_with_CSS_Grid) or when defining areas using [named grid areas](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Grid_Template_Areas).

![Image showing a highlighted grid area](1_grid_area.png)

Grid areas _must_ be rectangular in nature; it is not possible to create, for example, a T- or L-shaped grid area.

## Example

In the example below I have a grid container with two grid items. I have named these with the _cssxref("grid-area"_) property and then laid them out on the grid using _cssxref("grid-template-areas"_). This creates two grid areas, one covering four grid cells, the other two.

```css hidden
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
    border: 2px solid #f76707;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
    border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #ffd8a8;
    padding: 1em;
    color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
    grid-template-areas:
        'a a b'
        'a a b';
}
.item1 {
    grid-area: a;
}
.item2 {
    grid-area: b;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="item1">Item</div>
    <div class="item2">Item</div>
</div>

## Term: Grid Axis

- CSS
- CSS Grids

---

> CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout method enabling the laying out of content in _rows_ and _columns_. Therefore in any grid we have two axes. The _block or column axis_, and the _inline or row axis_.

It is along these axes that items can be aligned and justified using the properties defined in the [Box Alignment specification](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Box_Alignment_in_CSS_Grid_Layout).

In CSS the _block or column axis_ is the axis used when laying out blocks of text. If you have two paragraphs and are working in a right to left, top to bottom language they lay out one below the other, on the block axis.

![Diagram showing the block axis in CSS Grid Layout.](7_block_axis.png)

The _inline or row axis_ runs across the Block Axis and is the direction along which regular text flows. These are our rows in CSS Grid Layout.

![Diagram showing the inline axis in CSS Grid Layout.](7_inline_axis.png)

The physical direction of these axes can change according to the [writing mode](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_Logical_Values_and_Writing_Modes) of the document.

## Term: Grid Cell

- CSS Grids

---

> In a [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), a **grid cell** is the smallest unit you can have on your CSS grid. It is the space between four intersecting _glossary("grid lines"_) and conceptually much like a table cell.

![Diagram showing an individual cell on the grid.](1_grid_cell.png)

If you do not place items using one of the grid placement methods, direct children of the grid container will be placed one into each individual grid cell by the auto-placement algorithm. Additional row or column _glossary("grid tracks", "tracks"_) will be created to create enough cells to hold all items.

## Example

In the example we have created a three column track grid. The five items are placed into grid cells working along an initial row of three grid cells, then creating a new row for the remaining two.

```css hidden
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
    border: 2px solid #f76707;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
    border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #ffd8a8;
    padding: 1em;
    color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-auto-rows: 100px;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <div>One</div>
    <div>Two</div>
    <div>Three</div>
    <div>Four</div>
    <div>Five</div>
</div>

## Term: Grid Column

- CSS
- CodingScripting

---

> A **grid column** is a vertical track in a [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), and is the space between two vertical grid lines. It is defined by the _cssxref("grid-template-columns"_) property or in the shorthand _cssxref("grid"_) or _cssxref("grid-template"_) properties.

In addition, columns may be created in the _implicit grid_ when items are placed outside of columns created in the _explicit grid_. These columns will be auto-sized by default, or can have a size specified with the _cssxref("grid-auto-columns"_) property.

When working with alignment in [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), the axis down which columns run is known as the _block, or column, axis_.

## Term: Grid container

- CSS
- Glossary
- grid

---

> Using the value `grid` or `inline-grid` on an element turns it into a **grid container** using [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), and any direct children of this element become grid items.

When an element becomes a grid container it establishes a **grid formatting context**. The direct children can now lay themselves out on any explicit grid defined using _cssxref("grid-template-columns"_) and _cssxref("grid-template-rows"_), or on the _implicit grid_ created when an item is placed outside of the _explicit grid_.

## Term: Grid Lines

- CSS Grids

---

> **Grid lines** are created when you define _glossary("Grid tracks", "tracks"_) in the explicit grid using [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).

## Example

In the following example there is a grid with three column tracks and two row tracks. This gives us 4 column lines and 3 row lines.

```css hidden
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
    border: 2px solid #f76707;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #fff4e6;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
}

.wrapper > div {
    border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #ffd8a8;
    padding: 1em;
    color: #d9480f;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <div>One</div>
    <div>Two</div>
    <div>Three</div>
    <div>Four</div>
    <div>Five</div>
</div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
}
```

\_ EmbedLiveSample('Example', '500', '250') }}

Lines can be addressed using their line number. In a left-to-right language such as English, column line 1 will be on the left of the grid, row line 1 on the top. Lines numbers respect the [writing mode](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Writing_Modes) of the document and so in a right-to-left language for example, column line 1 will be on the right of the grid. The image below shows the line numbers of the grid, assuming the language is left-to-right.

![Diagram showing the grid with lines numbered.](1_diagram_numbered_grid_lines.png)

Lines are also created in the _implicit grid_ when implicit tracks are created to hold content positioned outside of the _explicit grid_, however these lines cannot be addressed by a number.

## Placing items onto the grid by line number

Having created a grid, you can place items onto the grid by line number. In the following example the item is positioned from column line 1 to column line 3, and from row line 1 to row line 3.

```css hidden
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
    border: 2px solid #f76707;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #fff4e6;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
}

.wrapper > div {
    border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #ffd8a8;
    padding: 1em;
    color: #d9480f;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="item">Item</div>
</div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
}
.item {
    grid-column-start: 1;
    grid-column-end: 3;
    grid-row-start: 1;
    grid-row-end: 3;
}
```

\_ EmbedLiveSample('Placing_items_onto_the_grid_by_line_number', '500', '250') }}

## Naming lines

The lines created in the _explicit grid_ can be named, by adding the name in square brackets before or after the track sizing information. When placing an item, you can then use these names instead of the line number, as demonstrated below.

```css hidden
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
    border: 2px solid #f76707;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #fff4e6;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px);
}

.wrapper > div {
    border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #ffd8a8;
    padding: 1em;
    color: #d9480f;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <div class="item">Item</div>
</div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: [col1-start] 1fr [col2-start] 1fr [col3-start] 1fr [cols-end];
    grid-template-rows: [row1-start] 100px [row2-start] 100px [rows-end];
}
.item {
    grid-column-start: col1-start;
    grid-column-end: col3-start;
    grid-row-start: row1-start;
    grid-row-end: rows-end;
}
```

## Term: Grid Row

- CSS Grids

---

> A **grid row** is a horizontal track in a [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), that is the space between two horizontal grid lines. It is defined by the _cssxref("grid-template-rows"_) property or in the shorthand _cssxref("grid"_) or _cssxref("grid-template"_) properties.

In addition, rows may be created in the _implicit grid_ when items are placed outside of rows created in the _explicit grid_. These rows will be auto sized by default, or can have a size specified with the _cssxref("grid-auto-rows"_) property.

When working with alignment in [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), the axis along which rows run is known as the _inline, or row, axis_.

## Term: Grid Tracks

- CSS Grids

---

> A **grid track** is the space between two adjacent _glossary("grid lines"_). They are defined in the _explicit grid_ by using the _cssxref("grid-template-columns"_) and _cssxref("grid-template-rows"_) properties or the shorthand _cssxref("grid"_) or _cssxref("grid-template"_) properties. Tracks are also created in the _implicit grid_ by positioning a grid item outside of the tracks created in the explicit grid.

The image below shows the first row track on a grid.

![Diagram showing a grid track.](1_grid_track.png)

## Track sizing in the explicit grid

When defining grid tracks using _cssxref("grid-template-columns"_) and _cssxref("grid-template-rows"_) you may use any length unit, and also the flex unit, `fr` which indicates a portion of the available space in the grid container.

## Example

The example below demonstrates a grid with three column tracks, one of 200 pixels, the second of 1fr, the third of 3fr. Once the 200 pixels has been subtracted from the space available in the grid container, the remaining space is divided by 4. One part is given to column 2, 3 parts to column 3.

```css hidden
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
    border: 2px solid #f76707;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
    border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #ffd8a8;
    padding: 1em;
    color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 3fr;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <div>One</div>
    <div>Two</div>
    <div>Three</div>
    <div>Four</div>
    <div>Five</div>
</div>
```

\_ EmbedLiveSample('Example', '500', '230') }}

## Track sizing in the implicit grid

Tracks created in the implicit grid are auto-sized by default, however you can define a size for these tracks using the _cssxref("grid-auto-rows"_) and _cssxref("grid-auto-columns"_) properties.

## Term: Grid

- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Glossary

---

> A _CSS grid_ is defined using the `grid` value of the _cssxref("display"_) property; you can define columns and rows on your grid using the _cssxref("grid-template-rows"_) and _cssxref("grid-template-columns"_) properties.

The grid that you define using these properties is described as an _explicit grid_.

If you place content outside of this explicit grid, or if you are relying on auto-placement and the grid algorithm needs to create additional row or column _glossary("grid tracks", "tracks"_) to hold _glossary("grid item", "grid items"_), then extra tracks will be created in the implicit grid. The _implicit grid_ is the grid created automatically due to content being added outside of the tracks defined.

In the example below I have created an _explicit grid_ of three columns and two rows. The _third_ row on the grid is an _implicit grid_ row track, formed due to their being more than the six items which fill the explicit tracks.

## Example

```css hidden
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
    border: 2px solid #f76707;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
    border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #ffd8a8;
    padding: 1em;
    color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <div>One</div>
    <div>Two</div>
    <div>Three</div>

> Guard is a feature of _domxref("Headers"_) objects (as defined in the _domxref("Fetch_API","Fetch spec"_), which affects whether methods such as _domxref("Headers.set","set()"_) and _domxref("Headers.append","append()"_) can change the header's contents. For example, `immutable` guard means that headers can't be changed. For more information, read [Fetch basic concepts: guard](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Basic_concepts#guard).

## Term: Gutters

- CSS Grids

---

> **Gutters** or _alleys_ are spacing between content tracks. These can be created in [CSS Grid Layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) using the _cssxref("column-gap"_), _cssxref("row-gap"_), or _cssxref("gap"_) properties.

## Example

In the example below we have a three-column and two-row track grid, with 20-pixel gaps between column tracks and `20px`-gaps between row tracks.

```css hidden
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.wrapper {
    border: 2px solid #f76707;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #fff4e6;
}

.wrapper > div {
    border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background-color: #fff8f8;
    padding: 1em;
    color: #d9480f;
}
```

```css
.wrapper {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1.2fr);
    grid-auto-rows: 45%;
    grid-column-gap: 20px;
    grid-row-gap: 20px;
}
```

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <div>One</div>
    <div>Two</div>
    <div>Three</div>
    <div>Four</div>
    <div>Five</div>
</div>
```

\_ EmbedLiveSample('Example', '300', '280') }}

In terms of grid sizing, gaps act as if they were a regular grid track however nothing can be placed into the gap. The gap acts as if the grid line at that location has gained extra size, so any grid item placed after that line begins at the end of the gap.

The grid-gap properties are not the only thing that can cause tracks to space out. Margins, padding or the use of the space distribution properties in [Box Alignment](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Box_Alignment_in_CSS_Grid_Layout) can all contribute to the visible gap - therefore the grid-gap properties should not be seen as equal to "the gutter size" unless you know that your design has not introduced any additional space with one of these methods.

## Term: High-level programming language

- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> A high-level programming language has a **significant abstraction** from the details of computer operation. It is designed to be easily understood by humans and for this reason they must be translated by another software. Unlike low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, or may automate (or even entirely hide) significant areas of computing systems, making the process of developing simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.

The idea of a language automatically translatable into machine code, but nearer to human logic, was introduced in computer science in the 1950s, especially thanks to the work of **John Backus** (IBM), to whom it owes the first high-level language to have been widely circulated: Fortran. For this innovation Backus received the Turing prize.

## Term: HMAC

> **Hash-based message authentication code**(_HMAC_) is a protocol used for _Glossary("cryptography", "cryptographically"_) authenticating messages.

It can use any kind of _Glossary("Cryptographic hash function", "cryptographic functions"_), and its strength depends on the underlying function (SHA1 or MD5 for instance), and the chosen secret key. With such a combination, the HMAC verification _Glossary("Algorithm", "algorithm"_) is then known with a compound name such as HMAC-SHA1.

HMAC is used to ensure both integrity and authentication.

## Term: Hoisting

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- JavaScript

---

> JavaScript **Hoisting** refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the _declaration_ of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

Hoisting allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

Variable and class _declarations_ are also hoisted, so they too can be referenced before they are declared.
Note that doing so can lead to unexpected errors, and is not generally recommended.

> **Note:** The term hoisting is not used in any normative specification prose prior to [ECMAScript® 2015 Language Specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html).
> Hoisting was thought up as a general way of thinking about how execution contexts (specifically the creation and execution phases) work in JavaScript.

## Function hoisting

One of the advantages of hoisting is that it lets you use a function before you declare it in your code.

```js
catName('Tiger');

function catName(name) {
    console.log("My cat's name is " + name);
}
/*
The result of the code above is: "My cat's name is Tiger"
*/
```

Without hoisting you would _have_ to write the same code like this:

---


```js


function catName(name) {
    console.log("My cat's name is " + name);
}

catName('Tiger');
/*
The result of the code above is the same: "My cat's name is Tiger"
*/
```

## Variable hoisting

Hoisting works with variables too, so you can use a variable in code before it is declared and/or initialized.

However JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations!
This means that initialization doesn't happen until the associated line of code is executed, even if the variable was originally initialized then declared, or declared and initialized in the same line.

Until that point in the execution is reached the variable has its _default_ initialization (`undefined` for a variable declared using `var`, otherwise uninitialized).

> **Note:** Conceptually variable hoisting is often presented as the interpreter "splitting variable declaration and initialization, and moving (just) the declarations to the top of the code".

Below are some examples showing what can happen if you use a variable before it is declared.

### `var` hoisting

Here we declare then initialize the value of a `var` after using it.
The default initialization of the `var` is `undefined`.

```js
console.log(num); // Returns 'undefined' from hoisted var declaration (not 6)
var num; // Declaration
num = 6; // Initialization
console.log(num); // Returns 6 after the line with initialization is executed.
```

The same thing happens if we declare and initialize the variable in the same line.

```js
console.log(num); // Returns 'undefined' from hoisted var declaration (not 6)
var num = 6; // Initialization and declaration.
console.log(num); // Returns 6 after the line with initialization is executed.
```

If we forget the declaration altogether (and only initialize the value) the variable isn't hoisted.
Trying to read the variable before it is initialized results in `ReferenceError` exception.

```js
console.log(num); // Throws ReferenceError exception - the interpreter doesn't know about `num`.
num = 6; // Initialization
```

Note however that initialization also causes declaration (if not already declared).
The code snippet below will work, because even though it isn't hoisted, the variable is initialized and effectively declared before it is used.

```js
a = 'Cran'; // Initialize a
b = 'berry'; // Initialize b

console.log(a + '' + b); // 'Cranberry'
```

### `let` and `const` hoisting

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but, unlike `var`, are not initialized with a default value.
An exception will be thrown if a variable declared with `let` or `const` is read before it is initialized.

```js
console.log(num); // Throws ReferenceError exception as the variable value is uninitialized
let num = 6; // Initialization
```

Note that it is the order in which code is _executed_ that matters, not the order in which it is written in the source file.
The code will succeed provided the line that initializes the variable is executed before any line that reads it.

For information and examples see [`let` > temporal dead zone](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz).

## `class` hoisting

Classes defined using a [class declaration](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#class_declarations) are hoisted, which means that JavaScript has a reference to the class.
However the class is not initialized by default, so any code that uses it before the line in which it is initialized is executed will throw a `ReferenceError`.

## Function and class expression hoisting

[Function expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) and [class expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#class_expressions) are not hoisted.

The expressions evaluate to a function or class (respectively), which are typically assigned to a variable.
In this case the variable declaration is hoisted and the expression is its initialization.
Therefore the expressions are not evaluated until the relevant line is executed.

> Houdini is a set of low level APIs that give developers the power to extend CSS, providing the ability to hook into the styling and layout process of a browser's rendering engine. Houdini gives developers access to the [CSS Object Model](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model) ([CSSOM](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSSOM)), enabling developers to write code the browser can parse as CSS.

The benefit of Houdini is that developers can create CSS features without waiting for web standards specifications to define them and without waiting for every browser to fully implement the features.

While many of the features Houdini enables can be created with JavaScript, interacting directly with the CSSOM before JavaScript is enabled provides for faster parse times. Browsers create the CSSOM — including layout, paint, and composite processes — before applying any style updates found in scripts: layout, paint, and composite processes are repeated for updated JavaScript styles to be implemented. Houdini code doesn't wait for that first rendering cycle to be complete. Rather, it is included in that first cycle, creating renderable, understandable styles.

You may sometimes hear about "new HTML5 elements", or find HTML5 described as a new version of HTML. HTML5 was the successor to previous HTML versions and introduced new elements and capabilities to the language on top of the previous version, HTML 4.01, as well as improving or removing some existing functionality. However, as a Living Standard HTML now has no version. The up-to-date specification can be found at [html.spec.whatwg.org/](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/).

Any modern site should use the [HTML doctype](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Code_guidelines/HTML#doctype) — this will ensure that you are using the latest version of HTML.

> **Note:** Until 2019, the _glossary("W3C"_) published a competing HTML5 standard with version numbers. Since [28 May 2019](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7753), the WHATWG Living Standard was announced by the W3C as the sole version of HTML.

## Term: HTML

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- HTML
- l10n:priority

---

> **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.

## Brief history

In 1990, as part of his vision of the _Glossary("World Wide Web","Web"_), Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of _Glossary("hypertext"_), which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on _Glossary("SGML"_). The _Glossary("IETF"_) began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the _Glossary("W3C"_) to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an _Glossary("ISO"_) standard in 2000.

At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of _Glossary("XHTML"_), prompting the founding of an independent group called _Glossary("WHATWG"_) in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on _Glossary("HTML5"_) continued: the two organizations released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014.

## Concept and syntax

![Detail of the structure of an HTML element](anatomy-of-an-html-element.png)

An HTML file is normally saved with an `.htm` or `.html` extension, served by a _Glossary("Server","web server"_), and can be rendered by any _Glossary("Browser","Web browser"_).

> **HTTP/2** is a major revision of the [HTTP network protocol](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP).

The primary goals for HTTP/2 are to reduce _glossary("latency"_) by enabling full request and response multiplexing, minimize protocol overhead via efficient compression of HTTP header fields, and add support for request prioritization and server push.

HTTP/2 does not modify the application semantics of HTTP in any way. All the core concepts found in HTTP 1.1, such as HTTP methods, status codes, URIs, and header fields, remain in place. Instead, HTTP/2 modifies how the data is formatted (framed) and transported between the client and server, both of which manage the entire process, and hides application complexity within the new framing layer. As a result, all existing applications can be delivered without modification.

## Term: HTTP header

- Glossary
- HTTP Header
- WebMechanics

---

> An **HTTP header** is a field of an HTTP request or response that passes additional context and metadata about the request or response. For example, a request message can use headers to indicate it's preferred media formats, while a response can use header to indicate the media format of the returned body. Headers are case-insensitive, begin at the start of a line and are immediately followed by a `':'` and a header-dependent value. The value finishes at the next CRLF or at the end of the message.

The HTTP and Fetch specifications refer to a number of header categories, including:

- _Glossary("Request header"_): Headers containing more information about the resource to be fetched or about the client itself.
- _Glossary("Response header"_): Headers with additional information about the response, like its location or about the server itself (name, version, …).
- _Glossary("Representation header"_): metadata about the resource in the message body (e.g. encoding, media type, etc.).
- _Glossary("Fetch metadata request header"_): Headers with metadata about the resource in the message body (e.g. encoding, media type, etc.).

A basic request with one header:

```plain
GET /example.http HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

Redirects have mandatory headers (_HTTPHeader("Location"_)):

```plain
302 Found
Location: /NewPage.html
```

A typical set of headers:

```plain
304 Not Modified
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Age: 2318192
Cache-Control: public, max-age=315360000
Connection: keep-alive

> **Note:** Older versions of the specification referred to:

## Term: Safe (HTTP Methods)

- Glossary
- WebMechanics

---

> An HTTP method is **safe** if it doesn't alter the state of the server. In other words, a method is safe if it leads to a read-only operation. Several common HTTP methods are safe: _HTTPMethod("GET"_), _HTTPMethod("HEAD"_), or _HTTPMethod("OPTIONS"_). All safe methods are also _glossary("idempotent"_), but not all idempotent methods are safe. For example, _HTTPMethod("PUT"_) and _HTTPMethod("DELETE"_) are both idempotent but unsafe.

Even if safe methods have a read-only semantic, servers can alter their state: e.g. they can log or keep statistics. What is important here is that by calling a safe method, the client doesn't request any server change itself, and therefore won't create an unnecessary load or burden for the server. Browsers can call safe methods without fearing to cause any harm to the server; this allows them to perform activities like pre-fetching without risk. Web crawlers also rely on calling safe methods.

Safe methods don't need to serve static files only; a server can generate an answer to a safe method on-the-fly, as long as the generating script guarantees safety: it should not trigger external effects, like triggering an order in an e-commerce Web site.

It is the responsibility of the application on the server to implement the safe semantic correctly, the webserver itself, being Apache, Nginx or IIS, can't enforce it by itself. In particular, an application should not allow _HTTPMethod("GET"_) requests to alter its state.

A call to a safe method, not changing the state of the server:

    GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1

A call to a non-safe method, that may change the state of the server:

    POST /pageX.html HTTP/1.1

A call to an idempotent but non-safe method:

    DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1

> **ICE** (_Interactive Connectivity Establishment_) is a framework used by _glossary("WebRTC"_) (among other technologies) for connecting two peers, regardless of network topology (usually for audio and video chat). This protocol lets two peers find and establish a connection with one another even though they may both be using Network Address Translator (_glossary("NAT"_)) to share a global IP address with other devices on their respective local networks.

The framework algorithm looks for the lowest-latency path for connecting the two peers, trying these options in order:

1.  Direct UDP connection (In this case—and only this case—a _glossary("STUN"_) server is used to find the network-facing address of a peer)
2.  Direct TCP connection, via the HTTP port
3.  Direct TCP connection, via the HTTPS port
4.  Indirect connection via a relay/_glossary("TURN"_) server (if a direct connection fails, e.g., if one peer is behind a firewall that blocks NAT traversal)

## Term: Idempotent

- Glossary
- WebMechanics

---

> An HTTP method is **idempotent** if an identical request can be made once or several times in a row with the same effect while leaving the server in the same state. In other words, an idempotent method should not have any side-effects (except for keeping statistics). Implemented correctly, the _HTTPMethod("GET"_), _HTTPMethod("HEAD"_), _HTTPMethod("PUT"_), and _HTTPMethod("DELETE"_) methods are **idempotent**, but not the _HTTPMethod("POST"_) method. All _glossary("Safe/HTTP", "safe"_) methods are also idempotent.

To be idempotent, only the actual back-end state of the server is considered, the status code returned by each request may differ: the first call of a _HTTPMethod("DELETE"_) will likely return a _HTTPStatus("200"_), while successive ones will likely return a _HTTPStatus("404"_). Another implication of _HTTPMethod("DELETE"_) being idempotent is that developers should not implement RESTful APIs with a _delete last entry_ functionality using the `DELETE` method.

Note that the idempotence of a method is not guaranteed by the server and some applications may incorrectly break the idempotence constraint.

`GET /pageX HTTP/1.1` is idempotent. Called several times in a row, the client gets the same results:

    GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
    GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
    GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
    GET /pageX HTTP/1.1

`POST /add_row HTTP/1.1` is not idempotent; if it is called several times, it adds several rows:

    POST /add_row HTTP/1.1
    POST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -> Adds a 2nd row
    POST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -> Adds a 3rd row

`DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1` is idempotent, even if the returned status code may change between requests:

    DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -> Returns 200 if idX exists
    DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -> Returns 404 as it just got deleted
    DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -> Returns 404

> An **identifier** is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a _glossary("variable"_), _glossary("function"_), or _glossary("property"_).

In _glossary("JavaScript"_), identifiers are case-sensitive and can contain _glossary("Unicode"_) letters, `$`, `_`, and digits (0-9), but may not start with a digit.

An identifier differs from a string in that a _glossary("string"_) is data, while an identifier is part of the code. In JavaScript, there is no way to convert identifiers to strings, but sometimes it is possible to parse strings into identifiers.

## Term: IDL

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- IDL
- Interface description language

---

> An **IDL** (_Interface Description Language_) is a generic language used to specified objects' interfaces apart from any specific programming language.

## Content versus IDL attributes

In HTML, most attributes have two faces: the **content attribute** and the **IDL attribute**.

The content attribute is the attribute as you set it from the content (the HTML code) and you can set it or get it via _domxref("element.setAttribute()"_) or _domxref("element.getAttribute()"_). The content attribute is always a string even when the expected value should be an integer. For example, to set an _HTMLElement("input"_) element's `maxlength` to 42 using the content attribute, you have to call `setAttribute("maxlength", "42")` on that element.

The IDL attribute is also known as a JavaScript property. These are the attributes you can read or set using JavaScript properties like `element.foo`. The IDL attribute is always going to use (but might transform) the underlying content attribute to return a value when you get it and is going to save something in the content attribute when you set it. In other words, the IDL attributes, in essence, reflect the content attributes.

Most of the time, IDL attributes will return their values as they are really used. For example, the default `type` for _HTMLElement("input"_) elements is "text", so if you set `input.type="foobar"`, the `<input>` element will be of type text (in the appearance and the behavior) but the "type" content attribute's value will be "foobar". However, the `type` IDL attribute will return the string "text".

IDL attributes are not always strings; for example, `input.maxlength` is a number (a signed long). When using IDL attributes, you read or set values of the desired type, so `input.maxlength` is always going to return a number and when you set `input.maxlength`, it wants a number. If you pass another type, it is automatically converted to a number as specified by the standard JavaScript rules for type conversion.

IDL attributes can [reflect other types](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/urls.html#reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes) such as unsigned long, URLs, booleans, etc. Unfortunately, there are no clear rules and the way IDL attributes behave in conjunction with their corresponding content attributes depends on the attribute. Most of the time, it will follow [the rules laid out in the specification](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/urls.html#reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes), but sometimes it doesn't. HTML specifications try to make this as developer-friendly as possible, but for various reasons (mostly historical), some attributes behave oddly (`select.size`, for example) and you should read the specifications to understand how exactly they behave.

## Term: IIFE

- CodingScripting
- DesignPattern
- Functions
- Glossary
- JavaScript

---

> An **IIFE** (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a _glossary("JavaScript"_) _glossary("function"_) that runs as soon as it is defined.
> The name IIFE is promoted by Ben Alman in [his blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033208/http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/#iife).

```js
(function () {
    statements;
})();
```

It is a design pattern which is also known as a _glossary("Self-Executing Anonymous Function"_) and contains two major parts:

1.  The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the _jsxref("Operators/Grouping", "Grouping Operator"_) `()`. This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
2.  The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression `()` through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.

## Use cases

### Avoid polluting the global namespace

Because our application could include many functions and global variables from different source files, it's
important to limit the number of global variables. If we have some initiation code that we don't need to use
again, we could use the IIFE pattern. As we will not reuse the code again, using IIFE in this case is better than
using a function declaration or a function expression.

```js
(function () {
    // some initiation code
    let firstVariable;
    let secondVariable;
})();

// firstVariable and secondVariable will be discarded after the function is executed.
```

### The module pattern

We would also use IIFE to create private and public variables and methods. For a more sophisticated use of the module
pattern and other use of IIFE, you could see the book Learning JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani.

```js
const makeWithdraw = (balance) =>
    (function (copyBalance) {
        let balance = copyBalance; // This variable is private
        let doBadThings = function () {
            console.log('I will do bad things with your money');
        };
        doBadThings();
        return {
            withdraw: function (amount) {
                if (balance >= amount) {
                    balance -= amount;
                    return balance;
                } else {
                    return 'Insufficient money';
                }
            }
        };
    })(balance);

const firstAccount = makeWithdraw(100); // "I will do bad things with your money"
console.log(firstAccount.balance); // undefined
console.log(firstAccount.withdraw(20)); // 80
console.log(firstAccount.withdraw(30)); // 50
console.log(firstAccount.doBadThings); // undefined; this method is private
const secondAccount = makeWithdraw(20); // "I will do bad things with your money"
console.log(secondAccount.withdraw(30)); // "Insufficient money"
console.log(secondAccount.withdraw(20)); // 0
```

### For loop with var before ES6

We could see the following use of IIFE in some old code, before the introduction of the statements **let** and **const**
in **ES6** and the block scope. With the statement **var**, we have only function scopes and the global scope.
Suppose we want to create 2 buttons with the texts Button 0 and Button 1 and we click
them, we would like them to alert 0 and 1. The following code doesn't work:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.innerText = 'Button ' + i;
    button.onclick = function () {
        alert(i);
    };
    document.body.appendChild(button);
}
console.log(i); // 2
```

When clicked, both Button 0 and Button 1 alert 2 because `i` is global,
with the last value 2. To fix this problem before ES6, we could use the IIFE pattern:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.innerText = 'Button ' + i;
    button.onclick = (function (copyOfI) {
        return function () {
            alert(copyOfI);
        };
    })(i);
    document.body.appendChild(button);
}
console.log(i); // 2
```

When clicked, Buttons 0 and 1 alert 0 and 1.
The variable `i` is globally defined.
Using the statement **let**, we could simply do:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    const button = document.createElement('button');
    button.innerText = 'Button ' + i;
    button.onclick = function () {
        alert(i);
    };
    document.body.appendChild(button);
}
console.log(i); // Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined.
```

When clicked, these buttons alert 0 and 1.

## Term: Intrinsic size

- CSS
- Glossary
- Intrinsic size

---

> In CSS, the _intrinsic size_ of an element is the size it would be based on its content, if no external factors were applied to it. For example, inline elements are sized intrinsically: `width`, `height`, and vertical margin and padding have no impact, though horizontal margin and padding do.

How intrinsic sizes are calculated is defined in the [CSS Intrinsic and Extrinsic Sizing Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#intrinsic-sizes).

Intrinsic sizing takes into account the `min-content` and `max-content` size of an element. For text the `min-content` size would be if the text wrapped as small as it can in the inline direction without causing an overflow, doing as much soft-wrapping as possible. For a box containing a string of text, the `min-content` size would be defined by the longest word. The keyword value of `min-content` for the _cssxref("width"_) property will size an element according to the `min-content` size.

The `max-content` size is the opposite — in the case of text, this would have the text display as wide as possible, doing no soft-wrapping, even if an overflow was caused. The keyword value `max-content` exposes this behavior.

For images the intrinsic size has the same meaning — it is the size that an image would be displayed if no CSS was applied to change the rendering. By default images are assumed to have a "1x" pixel density (1 device pixel = 1 CSS pixel) and so the intrinsic size is simply the pixel height and width. The intrinsic image size and resolution can be explicitly specified in the _Glossary("EXIF"_) data. The intrinsic pixel density may also be set for images using the _htmlattrxref("srcset", "img"_) attribute (note that if both mechanisms are used, the `srcset` value is applied "over" the EXIF value).

The JVM is available across many platforms, which allows Java programs to run almost everywhere without the need to be compiled or packaged again. This makes it a preferred language in many large enterprises with heterogenous landscapes, but may be perceived "heavy".

> ## Summary

JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the _Glossary("Server","server"_)-side, using a runtime such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

JavaScript **should not** be confused with the _interwiki("wikipedia", "Java_(programming*language)", "Java programming language"*). Although _"Java"_ and _"JavaScript"_ are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and use cases.

JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the _Glossary("DOM"_), manipulate data with _Glossary("AJAX"_) and _Glossary("IndexedDB"_), draw graphics with _Glossary("canvas"_), interact with the device running the browser through various _Glossary("API","APIs"_), and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of _Glossary("API","APIs"_) available in browsers.

## Origins and History

Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and _glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer", "Internet Explorer 3.0"_) introduced JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.

In November 1996, Netscape began working with ECMA International to make JavaScript an industry standard. Since then, the standardized JavaScript is called ECMAScript and specified under ECMA-262, whose latest (eleventh, ES2020) edition is available as of June 2020.

Recently, JavaScript's popularity has expanded even further through the successful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) platform—the most popular cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser. Node.js - built using [Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)>) - allows developers to use JavaScript as a scripting language to automate things on a computer and build fully functional _Glossary("HTTP"_) and _Glossary("WebSockets"_) servers.

---

> **JPEG** (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images.

JPEG compression is composed of three compression techniques applied in successive layers, including chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transformation and quantization, and run-length Delta & Huffman encoding. Chroma subsampling involves implementing less resolution for chroma information than for luma information, taking advantage of the human visual system's lower acuity for color differences than for luminance. A discrete cosine transform expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies.

---

> **jQuery** is a _Glossary("JavaScript"_) _Glossary("Library"_) that focuses on simplifying _Glossary("DOM"_) manipulation, _Glossary("AJAX"_) calls, and _Glossary("Event"_) handling.

jQuery uses a format, `$(selector).action()` to assign an element(s) to an event. To explain it in detail, `$(selector)` will call jQuery to select `selector` element(s), and assign it to an event _Glossary("API"_) called `.action()`.

```js
$(document).ready(function () {
    alert('Hello World!');
    $('#blackBox').hide();
});
```

The above code carries out the same function as the following code:

```js
window.onload = function () {
    alert('Hello World!');
    document.getElementById('blackBox').style.display = 'none';
};
```

Or:

```js
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    alert('Hello World!');
    document.getElementById('blackBox').style.display = 'none';
});
```

> _JavaScript Object Notation_ (**JSON**) is a data-interchange format. Although not a strict subset, JSON closely resembles a subset of _Glossary("JavaScript"_) syntax. Though many programming languages support JSON, it is especially useful for JavaScript-based apps, including websites and browser extensions.

JSON can represent numbers, booleans, strings, `null`, arrays (ordered sequences of values), and objects (string-value mappings) made up of these values (or of other arrays and objects). JSON does not natively represent more complex data types like functions, regular expressions, dates, and so on. (Date objects by default serialize to a string containing the date in ISO format, so the information isn't completely lost.) If you need JSON to represent additional data types, transform values as they are serialized or before they are deserialized.

Encrypted messages should remain secure even if everything about the _Glossary("cryptosystem"_), except for the key, is public knowledge.

In _Glossary("symmetric-key cryptography"_), the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. In _Glossary("public-key cryptography"_), there exists a pair of related keys known as the _public key_ and _private key_. The public key is freely available, whereas the private key is kept secret. The public key is able to encrypt messages that only the corresponding private key is able to decrypt, and vice versa.

When you use a search engine, you use keywords to specify what you are looking for, and the search engine returns relevant webpages. For more accurate results, try more specific keywords, such as "Blue Mustang GTO" instead of "Mustang". Webpages also use keywords in a meta tag (in the _htmlelement("head"_) section) to describe page content, so search engines can better identify and organize webpages.

This becomes important, for example, on mobile devices, where a pinching gesture can usually be used to zoom in and out on a site's contents. The rendered document doesn't change in any way, so the layout viewport remains the same as the user adjusts the zoom level. Instead, the visual viewport is updated to indicate the area of the page that they can see.

- [String literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#string_literals)

## Examples

### String literals

A string literal is zero or more characters enclosed in double (`"`) or single quotation marks (`'`). A string must be delimited by quotation marks of the same type (that is, either both single quotation marks, or both double quotation marks).

The following are examples of string literals:

```js
'foo';
'bar';
'1234';
'one line \n new line';
"John's cat";
```

### Object literals

An object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces (`{}`).

The following is an example of an object literal. The first element of the `car` object defines a property, `myCar`, and assigns to it a new string, "`Toyota`"; the second element, the `getCar` property, is immediately assigned the result of invoking the function `carTypes('Honda')`; the third element, the `special` property, uses an existing variable (`sales`).

```js
var sales = 'BMW';

function carTypes(name) {
    if (name == 'Honda') {
        return name;
    } else {
        return "Sorry, we don't sell " + name + '.';
    }
}

var car = { myCar: 'Toyota', getCar: carTypes('Honda'), special: sales };

console.log(car.myCar); // Toyota
console.log(car.getCar); // Honda
console.log(car.special); // BMW
```

## Term: Loop

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- control flow
- programming

---

> A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is met in _Glossary("computer programming"_). An example would be the process of getting an item of data and changing it, and then making sure some _Glossary("conditional", "condition"_) is checked such as, if a counter has reached a prescribed number.

## Examples

### For loop

#### Syntax:

    for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3){
     execute code block
    }

- Statement 1 is executed once before the code block is run.
- Statement 2 defines the condition needed to execute the code block.
- Statement 3 is executed every time the code block is run.

#### Example:

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
//This loop will print numbers 0-9, will stop when condition is met (i = 10)
```

For the above example, the syntax is as follows:

- Statement 1 sets the variable for the loop (var i = 0).
- Statement 2 sets the loop condition (i < 10).
- Statement 3 increases the value of i (i++) each time the code block is run.

### While loop

#### Syntax:

    while (condition){
     execute code block
    }

- The code block will continue to loop as long as the condition is true.

#### Example:

```js
var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
//This loop  will print number 0-4, will stop when condition becomes false (i >=5)
```

For the above example, the syntax is as follows:

- The code block will continue to run as long as the variable (i) is less than 5.

---

> **Lossy compression**, or irreversible compression, is a data-compression method that uses inexact approximations and partial-data discarding to represent content. In simpler terms: lossy compression causes data from the initial file to be lost, possibly causing degradation in quality. The process of such compression is irreversible; once lossy compression of the content has been performed, the content cannot be restored to its original state. Therefore, content that has undergone lossy compression should generally not be further edited.

Lossy compression is widely used in image formats.

- `row`
- `row-reverse`
- `column`
- `column-reverse`

Should you choose `row` or `row-reverse` then your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.

![In this image the flex-direction is row which forms the main axis](basics1.png)

Choose `column` or `column-reverse` and your main axis will run top to bottom of the page in the block direction.

![](basics2.png)

On the main axis you can control the sizing of flex items by adding any available space to the items themselves, by way of `flex` properties on the items. Or, you can control the space between and around items by using the `justify-content` property.

## Term: Main thread

> The **main thread** is where a browser processes user events and paints. By default, the browser uses a single thread to run all the JavaScript in your page, as well as to perform layout, reflows, and garbage collection. This means that long-running JavaScript functions can block the thread, leading to an unresponsive page and a bad user experience.

Unless intentionally using a [web worker](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), such as a [service worker](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers), JavaScript runs on the main thread, so it's easy for a script to cause delays in event processing or painting. The less work required of the main thread, the more that thread can respond to user events, paint, and generally be responsive to the user.

Microsoft first bundled IE with Windows in 1995 as part of the package called "Microsoft Plus!". By around 2002, Internet Explorer had become the most used browser in the world, but has since lost ground to Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.

IE has gone through many releases and currently stands at version 11.0.12, with desktop, mobile, and Xbox Console versions available. Formerly available on Mac and UNIX, Microsoft discontinued those versions in 2003 and 2001 respectively.

> Middleware is a (loosely defined) term for any software or service that enables the parts of a system to communicate and manage data. It is the software that handles communication between components and input/output, so developers can focus on the specific purpose of their application.

In server-side web application frameworks, the term is often more specifically used to refer to pre-built software components that can be added to the framework's request/response processing pipeline, to handle tasks such as database access.

> **Minification** is the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how a resource is processed by the browser.

Minification can include the removal of code comments, white space, and unused code, as well as the shortening of variable and function names. Minification is used to improve web performance by reducing file size. It is generally an automated step that occurs at build time.

As minification makes code less legible to humans, developer tools have 'prettification' features that can add white space back into the code to make it a bit more legible.

## Term: MitM

- Glossary
- Security

---

> A **manipulator-in-the-middle attack** (MitM) intercepts a communication between two systems. For example, a Wi-Fi router can be compromised.

Comparing this to physical mail: If you're writing letters to each other, the mail carrier can intercept each letter you mail. They open it, read it, eventually modify it, and then repackage the letter and only then send it to whom you intended to sent the letter for. The original recipient would then mail you a letter back, and the mail carrier would again open the letter, read it, eventually modify it, repackage it, and give it to you. You wouldn't know there's a manipulator in the middle in your communication channel - the mail carrier is invisible to you and to your recipient.

In physical mail and in online communication, MITM attacks are tough to defend. A few tips:

- Don't just ignore certificate warnings. You could be connecting to a phishing server or an imposter server.
- Sensitive sites without HTTPS encryption on public Wi-Fi networks aren't trustworthy.
- Check for HTTPS in your address bar and ensure encryption is in-place before logging in.

> A _mixin_ is a _Glossary("class"_) (interface, in WebAPI spec terms) in which some or all of its _Glossary("method", "methods"_) and/or _Glossary("property", "properties"_) are unimplemented, requiring that another _Glossary("class"_) or _Glossary("interface"_) provide the missing implementations.

The new class or interface then includes both the properties and methods from the mixin as well as those it defines itself. All of the methods and properties are used exactly the same regardless of whether they're implemented in the mixin or the interface or class that implements the mixin.

The advantage of mixins is that they can be used to simplify the design of APIs in which multiple interfaces need to include the same methods and properties.

For example, the `WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope` mixin is used to provide methods and properties that need to be available on both the _domxref("Window"_) and _domxref("WorkerGlobalScope"_) interfaces. The mixin is implemented by both of those interfaces.

> _Mutable_ is a type of variable that can be changed. In _glossary("JavaScript"_), only _Glossary("Object","objects"_) and _Glossary("Array","arrays"_) are mutable, not _Glossary("primitive", "primitive values"_).

(You _can_ make a variable name point to a new value, but the previous value is still held in memory. Hence the need for garbage collection.)

A **mutable object** is an object whose state can be modified after it is created.

**Immutables** are the objects whose state cannot be changed once the object is created.

**Strings and Numbers** are **Immutable**. Lets understand this with an example:

    var immutableString = "Hello";

    // In the above code, a new object with string value is created.

    immutableString = immutableString + "World";

    // We are now appending "World" to the existing value.

On appending the "immutableString" with a string value, following events occur:

1.  Existing value of "immutableString" is retrieved
2.  "World" is appended to the existing value of "immutableString"
3.  The resultant value is then allocated to a new block of memory
4.  "immutableString" object now points to the newly created memory space
5.  Previously created memory space is now available for garbage collection.

## Term: MVC

- Glossary
- Infrastructure
- Intro
- MVC
- Model View Controller

---

> **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance. Some other design patterns are based on MVC, such as MVVM (Model-View-Viewmodel), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVW (Model-View-Whatever).

The three parts of the MVC software-design pattern can be described as follows:

1.  Model: Manages data and business logic.
2.  View: Handles layout and display.
3.  Controller: Routes commands to the model and view parts.

## Model View Controller example

Imagine a simple shopping list app. All we want is a list of the name, quantity and price of each item we need to buy this week. Below we'll describe how we could implement some of this functionality using MVC.

![Diagram to show the different parts of the mvc architecture.](model-view-controller-light-blue.png)

### The Model

The model defines what data the app should contain. If the state of this data changes, then the model will usually notify the view (so the display can change as needed) and sometimes the controller (if different logic is needed to control the updated view).

Going back to our shopping list app, the model would specify what data the list items should contain — item, price, etc. — and what list items are already present.

### The View

The view defines how the app's data should be displayed.

In our shopping list app, the view would define how the list is presented to the user, and receive the data to display from the model.

### The Controller

The controller contains logic that updates the model and/or view in response to input from the users of the app.

So for example, our shopping list could have input forms and buttons that allow us to add or delete items. These actions require the model to be updated, so the input is sent to the controller, which then manipulates the model as appropriate, which then sends updated data to the view.

You might however also want to just update the view to display the data in a different format, e.g., change the item order to alphabetical, or lowest to highest price. In this case the controller could handle this directly without needing to update the model.

## MVC on the web

As a web developer, this pattern will probably be quite familiar even if you've never consciously used it before. Your data model is probably contained in some kind of database (be it a traditional server-side database like MySQL, or a client-side solution such as [IndexedDB \[en-US\]](/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API).) Your app's controlling code is probably written in HTML/JavaScript, and your user interface is probably written using HTML/CSS/whatever else you like. This sounds very much like MVC, but MVC makes these components follow a more rigid pattern.

In the early days of the Web, MVC architecture was mostly implemented on the server-side, with the client requesting updates via forms or links, and receiving updated views back to display in the browser. However, these days, more of the logic is pushed to the client with the advent of client-side data stores, and XMLHttpRequest allowing partial page updates as required.

Web frameworks such as [AngularJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS) and [Ember.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js 'Ember.js') all implement an MVC architecture, albeit in slightly different ways.

## Term: Namespace

> Namespace is a context for identifiers, a logical grouping of names used in a program. Within the same context and same scope, an identifier must uniquely identify an entity.

## Term: NaN

- CodingScripting
- Computing
- Glossary
- NaN

---

> NaN (Not a Number) is a numeric _Glossary("Type", "data type"_) that means an undefined value or value that cannot be represented, especially results of floating-point calculations.

For example, NaNs can represent infinity, result of division by zero, missing value, or the square root of a negative (which is imaginary, whereas a floating-point number is real).

Practically speaking, if I divide two variables in a _glossary("JavaScript"_) program, the result may be NaN, which is predefined in JavaScript as "undefined". Hence this division may break the program. Now, if this computation was a small part of a much larger algorithm, it would be really painful to figure out where the error actually occurs. Fortunately, since the result will be NaN and I know my divisor may turn out to be 0, I can set up testing conditions that prevent any such computations in the first place or notify me of where they happen.

> **Network throttling** is an intentional slowing down of internet speed. In web performance, network throttling, or network condition emulation, it is used to emulate low bandwidth conditions experienced by likely a large segment of a site's target user base.

It's important not to overlook network conditions users experience on mobile. The internet speeds for developers creating web applications in a corporate office building on a powerful computer are generally very fast. As a developer, tech writer, or designer, this is likely your experience. The network speeds of a mobile user accessing that web application, possibly while traveling or in a remote area with poor data plan coverage, will likely be very slow, if they are able to get online at all. Network throttling enables a developer to emulate an experience of a user. Most browser developer tools, such as the browser inspector, provide a function to emulate different network conditions. By emulating your user's experience via network throttling, you can more readily identify and fix load time issues.

Browser developer tools generally have network throttling options, to allow you to test your app under slow network conditions. Firefox's developer tools for example have a drop-down menu available in both the [Network Monitor](/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor) and [Responsive Design Mode](/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode) containing network speed options (e.g. wifi, good 3G, 2G...)

Some operations are restricted to same-origin content, and this restriction can be lifted using _Glossary("CORS"_).

## Examples

These are same origin because they have the same scheme (`http`) and hostname (`example.com`), and the different file path does not matter:

- `http://example.com/app1/index.html`
- `http://example.com/app2/index.html`

These are same origin because a server delivers HTTP content through port 80 by default:

- `http://Example.com:80`
- `http://example.com`

These are not same origin because they use different schemes:

- `http://example.com/app1`
- `https://example.com/app2`

These are not same origin because they use different hostnames:

- `http://example.com`
- `http://www.example.com`
- `http://myapp.example.com`

These are not same origin because they use different ports:

- `http://example.com`

## Term: Packet

- Glossary
- Network packet
- Packet
- Reference
- TCP
- Web Performance
- payload

---

> A packet, or network packet, is a formatted chunk of data sent over a network. The main components of a network packet are the user data and control information. The user data is known as the _payload_. The control information is the information for delivering the payload. It consists of network addresses for the source and destination, sequencing information, and error detection codes and is generally found in packet headers and footer.

## What a packet contains

### Hop limit

A hop occurs when a packet is passed from one network to the next network. It is a field that is decreases by one each time a packet goes through, once it reaches 0 it has failed and the packet is discarded.

Over time the number packets can cause traversing within closed circuits, the number of packets circulating would build up and then ultimately lead to the networking in failing.

### Error detection and correction

Error detection and correction are codes that are used to detect and apply corrections to the errors that occur when data is transmitted to the receiver. There are two types of error corrections backward and forward error correction. Backward error correction is when the receiver requests the sender to retransmit the entire data unit. Forward error correction is when the receiver uses the error-correcting code which automatically corrects the errors

At the transmitter, the calculation is performed before the packet is sent. When received at the destination, the checksum is recalculated, and compared with the one in the packet.

### Priority

This field indicates which packet should have higher priority over the others. The high priority queue is emptied more quickly than lower priority queues when the network is congested.

### Addresses

When routing network packets it requires two network addresses the source address of the sending host, and the destination address of the receiving host.

### User Data - Payload

Payload is the data that is carried on behalf of an application. It is usually of variable length, up to a maximum that is set by the network protocol and sometimes the equipment on the route.

## Term: Page load time

---

> **Page load time** is the time it takes for a page to load, measured from [navigation start](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/navigationStart) to the [start of the load event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/loadEventStart).

```js
let time = performance.timing;

let pageloadtime = time.loadEventStart - time.navigationStart;
```

While page load time 'sounds' like the perfect web performance metric, it isn't. Load times can vary greatly between users depending on device capabilities, network conditions, and, to a lesser extent, distance from the server. The development environment, where page load time is measured, is likely an optimal experience, not reflective of your users' reality. In addition, web performance isn't just about when the load event happens. It's also about [perceived performance](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Perceived_performance), responsiveness, [jank](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Jank) and jitter.

## Term: Page prediction

- Glossary

- Web Performance
- page prediction

---

> **Page Prediction** is a browser feature or script which, when enabled, tells the browser to download resources the user is likely to visit before the user requests the content. Page prediction improves performance by enabling almost instant loading of predicted content. However, page prediction may also download content a user does not seek.

Some web applications include a prediction feature completing search text and address bar URLs based on browsing history and related searches. For example, as the user types in the address bar, the browser might send the current text in the address bar to the search engine before the user submits the request.

Although browser page prediction and prediction services enable faster page loads, they consume additional bandwidth. Also, pre-loaded websites and embedded content can set and read their cookies as if they were visited even if they weren't.

## Term: Parameter

- CodingScripting

---

> A parameter is a named variable passed into a _Glossary("function"_). Parameter variables are used to import _Glossary("argument","arguments"_) into functions.

For example:

---


```js


function example(parameter) {
    console.log(parameter); // Output = foo
}

const argument = 'foo';

example(argument);
```

Note the difference between _parameters_ and _arguments_:

- Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition.
- Function _Glossary("argument","arguments"_) are the real values passed to the function.
- Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied.

Two kinds of parameters:

- input parameters
- - : the most common kind; they pass values into functions. Depending on programming language, input parameters can be passed several ways (e.g., call-by-value, call-by-address, call-by-reference).
- output/return parameters
    - : primarily return multiple values from a function, but not recommended since they cause confusion

> Parsing means analyzing and converting a program into an internal format that a runtime environment can actually run, for example the _glossary("JavaScript"_) engine inside browsers.

When the browser encounters CSS styles, it parses the text into the CSS Object Model (or _glossary('CSSOM'_)), a data structure it then uses for styling layouts and painting. The browser then creates a render tree from both these structures to be able to paint the content to the screen. JavaScript is also downloaded, parsed, and then execute.

JavaScript parsing is done during _glossary("compile time"_) or whenever the _glossary("parser"_) is invoked, such as during a call to a method.

## Term: Payload body

- HTTP
- HTTP Header

---

> The HTTP message _payload body_ is the _information_ ("payload") part of the data that is sent in the HTTP Message Body (if any), prior to _HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding","transfer encoding"_) being applied. If transfer encoding is not used, the _payload body_ and _message body_ are the same thing!

For example, in this response the message body contains only the payload body: "Mozilla Developer Network":

```plain
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

Mozilla Developer Network
```

By contrast, the below response uses _transfer encoding_ to encode the payload body into chunks. The payload body (information) sent is still "Mozilla Developer Network", but the message body includes additional data to separate the chunks:

```plain
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

7\r\n
Mozilla\r\n
9\r\n
Developer\r\n
7\r\n
Network\r\n
0\r\n
\r\n
```

This includes information like the length of the message payload, which part of the resource is carried in this payload (for a multi-part message), any encoding applied for transport, message integrity checks, etc.

Payload headers may be present in both HTTP request and response messages (i.e. in any message that is carrying payload data).

The payload headers include: _HTTPHeader("Content-Length"_), _HTTPHeader("Content-Range"_), _HTTPHeader("Trailer"_), and _HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding"_).

## Term: Percent-encoding

- Glossary
- WebMechanics

---

> **Percent-encoding** is a mechanism to encode 8-bit characters that have specific meaning in the context of _Glossary("URL", "URLs"_). It is sometimes called URL encoding. The encoding consists of substitution: A '%' followed by the hexadecimal representation of the ASCII value of the replace character.

Special characters needing encoding are: `':'`, `'/'`, `'?'`, `'#'`, `'['`, `']'`, `'@'`, `'!'`, `'$'`, `'&'`, `"'"`, `'('`, `')'`, `'*'`, `'+'`, `','`, `';'`, `'='`, as well as `'%'` itself. Other characters don't need to be encoded, though they could.

| Character | Encoding     |
| --------- | ------------ |
| `':'`     | `%3A`        |
| `'/'`     | `%2F`        |
| `'?'`     | `%3F`        |
| `'#'`     | `%23`        |
| `'['`     | `%5B`        |
| `']'`     | `%5D`        |
| `'@'`     | `%40`        |
| `'!'`     | `%21`        |
| `'$'`     | `%24`        |
| `'&'`     | `%26`        |
| `"'"`     | `%27`        |
| `'('`     | `%28`        |
| `')'`     | `%29`        |
| `'*'`     | `%2A`        |
| `'+'`     | `%2B`        |
| `','`     | `%2C`        |
| `';'`     | `%3B`        |
| `'='`     | `%3D`        |
| `'%'`     | `%25`        |
| `' '`     | `%20` or `+` |

Depending on the context, the character `' '` is translated to a `'+'` (like in the percent-encoding version used in an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` message), or in `'%20'` like on URLs.

## Term: Plugin

> A browser plugin is a software component that users can install to handle content that the browser can't support natively. Browser plugins are usually written using the [NPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPAPI) (Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface) architecture.

The most well-known and widely used plugin was the Adobe Flash player, which enabled browsers to run _Glossary("Adobe Flash"_) content.

As browsers have become more powerful, plugins have become less useful. Plugins also have a history of causing security and performance problems for web users.

Between 2016 and 2021 browser vendors worked on a deprecation roadmap for plugins and in particular for Adobe Flash, and today plugins are no longer supported by any major browsers.

Plugins should not be confused with browser extensions, which unlike plugins are distributed as source code rather than binaries, and which are still supported by browsers, notably using the _Glossary("WebExtensions"_) system.

## Term: Polyfill

- Browser Support
- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- JavaScript
- polyfill

---

> A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

For example, a polyfill could be used to mimic the functionality of a _cssxref("text-shadow"_) in IE7 using proprietary IE filters, or mimic rem units or media queries by using JavaScript to dynamically adjust the styling as appropriate, or whatever else you require.

The reason why polyfills are not used exclusively is for better functionality and better performance. Native implementations of APIs can do more and are faster than polyfills. For example, the [Object.create polyfill](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create#polyfill) only contains the functionalities that are possible in a non-native implementation of Object.create.

Other times, polyfills are used to address issues where browsers implement the same features in different ways. The polyfill uses non-standard features in a certain browser to give JavaScript a standards-compliant way to access the feature. Although this reason for polyfilling is very rare today, it was especially prevalent back in the days of IE6 and Netscape where each browser implemented JavaScript very differently. The [1st version of JQuery](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.js) was an early example of a polyfill. It was essentially a compilation of browser-specific workarounds to provide JavaScript developers with a single common API that worked in all browsers. At the time, JavaScript developers were having major problems trying to get their website to work across all devices because there was such a discrepancy between browsers that the website might have to be programmed radically differently and have a much different user interface based upon the user's browser. Thus, the JavaScript developer had access to only a very tiny handful of JavaScript APIs that worked more-or-less consistently across all browsers. Using a polyfill to handle browser-specific implementations is less common today because modern browsers mostly implement a broad set of APIs according to standard semantics.

## Term: Prefetch

- Glossary
- Prefetch
- Reference
- Web Performance

---

> Prefetching is when content is downloaded in the background, this is based on the assumption that the content will likely be requested, enabling the content to load instantly if and when the user requests it. The content is downloaded and cached for anticipated future use without the user making an explicit request for it.

### DNS Prefetching

Domain lookups can be slow, especially with network latency on mobile phones. They are most relevant when there are a plethora of links to external websites that may be clicked on, like search engine results, DNS prefetching resolves domain names in advance thereby speeding up load times by reducing the time associated with domain lookup at request time.

    <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://example.com/">

### Link prefetching

Link prefetching is a performance optimization technique that works by assuming which links the user is likely to click, then downloading the content of those links. If the user decides to click on one of the links, then the page will be rendered instantly as the content has already been downloaded.

The prefetch hints are sent in HTTP headers:

    Link: ; rel=dns-prefetch,
          ; as=script; rel=preload,
          ; rel=prerender,
          ; as=style; rel=preload

### Prefetch attribute value

Browsers will prefetch content when the prefetch [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) tag directs it to, giving the developer control over what resources should be prefetched.

     <link rel="prefetch" href="https://www.example.com/solutions" />

A preflight request is automatically issued by a browser and in normal cases, front-end developers don't need to craft such requests themselves. It appears when request is qualified as ["to be preflighted"](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#preflighted_requests) and omitted for [simple requests](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests).

For example, a client might be asking a server if it would allow a _HTTPMethod("DELETE"_) request, before sending a `DELETE` request, by using a preflight request:

```plain
OPTIONS /resource/foo
Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE
Access-Control-Request-Headers: origin, x-requested-with
Origin: https://foo.bar.org
```

If the server allows it, then it will respond to the preflight request with an _HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods"_) response header, which lists `DELETE`:

```plain
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Connection: keep-alive
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://foo.bar.org
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```

The preflight response can be optionally cached for the requests created in the same _Glossary("URL"_) using _HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age"_) header like in the above example.

## Term: Primitive

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- JavaScript

---

> In _Glossary("JavaScript"_), a **primitive** (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an _Glossary("object"_) and has no _glossary("method","methods"_). There are 7 primitive data types: _Glossary("string"_), _Glossary("number"_), _Glossary("bigint"_), _Glossary("boolean"_), _Glossary("undefined"_), _Glossary("symbol"_), and _Glossary("null"_).

Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.

All primitives are **immutable**, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be reassigned a new value, but the existing value can not be changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.

## Example

This example will help you understand that primitive values are **immutable.**

### JavaScript

```js
// Using a string method doesn't mutate the string
var bar = 'baz';
console.log(bar); // baz
bar.toUpperCase();
console.log(bar); // baz

// Using an array method mutates the array
var foo = [];
console.log(foo); // []
foo.push('plugh');
console.log(foo); // ["plugh"]

// Assignment gives the primitive a new (not a mutated) value
bar = bar.toUpperCase(); // BAZ
```

A primitive can be replaced, but it can't be directly altered.

## Primitive wrapper objects in JavaScript

Except for `null` and `undefined`, all primitive values have object equivalents that wrap around the primitive values:

- _jsxref("String"_) for the string primitive.
- _jsxref("Number"_) for the number primitive.
- _jsxref("BigInt"_) for the bigint primitive.
- _jsxref("Boolean"_) for the boolean primitive.
- _jsxref("Symbol"_) for the symbol primitive.

The wrapper's [`valueOf()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/valueOf) method returns the primitive value.

## Term: Progressive Enhancement

- Accessibility
- Design
- Glossary

---

> **Progressive enhancement** is a design philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.

The word _progressive_ in _progressive enhancement_ means creating a design that achieves a simpler-but-still-usable experience for users of older browsers and devices with limited capabilities, while at the same time being a design that **progresses the user experience up** to a more-compelling, fully-featured experience for users of newer browsers and devices with richer capabilities.

[Feature detection](/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection) is generally used to determine whether browsers can handle more modern functionality, while [polyfills](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) are often used to add missing features with JavaScript.

Special notice should be taken of accessibility. Acceptable alternatives should be provided where possible.

Progressive enhancement is a useful technique that allows web developers to focus on developing the best possible websites while making those websites work on multiple unknown user agents. _Glossary("Graceful degradation"_) is related but is not the same thing and is often seen as going in the opposite direction to progressive enhancement. In reality both approaches are valid and can often complement one another.

## Term: Public-key cryptography

- Cryptography
- Glossary
- Public-key cryptography
- Security

---

> Public-key cryptography — or _asymmetric cryptography_ — is a cryptographic system in which keys come in pairs. The transformation performed by one of the keys can only be undone with the other key. One key (the _private key_) is kept secret while the other is made public.

When used for digital signatures, the private key is used to sign and the public key to verify. This means that anyone can verify a signature, but only the owner of the corresponding private key could have generated it.

When used for encryption, the public key is used to encrypt and the private key is used to decrypt. This gives public-key encryption systems an advantage over symmetric encryption systems in that the encryption key can be made public. Anyone could encrypt a message to the owner of the private key, but only the owner of the private key could decrypt it. However, they are typically much slower than symmetric algorithms and the size of message they can encrypt is proportional to the size of the key, so they do not scale well for long messages.

As a result, it's common for an encryption system to use a symmetric algorithm to encrypt the message, then a public-key system to encrypt the symmetric key. This arrangement can confer the benefits of both systems.

Commonly used public-key cryptosystems are RSA (for both signing and encryption), DSA (for signing) and Diffie-Hellman (for key agreement).

## Term: Quality values

- Glossary
- WebMechanics

---

> **Quality values**, or _q-values_ and _q-factors_, are used to describe the order of priority of values in a comma-separated list. It is a special syntax allowed in some [HTTP headers](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) and in HTML.

The importance of a value is marked by the suffix `';q='` immediately followed by a value between `0` and `1` included, with up to three decimal digits, the highest value denoting the highest priority. When not present, the default value is `1`.

## Examples

The following syntax

```plain
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
```

indicates the order of priority:

| Value                                   | Priority |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `text/html` and `application/xhtml+xml` | `1.0`    |
| `application/xml`                       | `0.9`    |
| `*/*`                                   | `0.8`    |

If there is no priority defined for the first two values, the order in the list is irrelevant. Nevertheless, with the same quality, more specific values have priority over less specific ones:

```plain
text/html;q=0.8,text/*;q=0.8,*/*;q=0.8
```

| Value       | Priority                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `text/html` | `0.8` (but totally specified) |
| `text/*`    | `0.8` (partially specified)   |
| `*/*`       | `0.8` (not specified)         |

Some syntax, like the one of _HTTPHeader("Accept"_), allow additional specifiers like `text/html;level=1`. These increase the specificity of the value. Their use is extremely rare.

## Browser-specific information

### Firefox

Starting with Firefox 18, the quality factor values are clamped to 2 decimal places. They used to be clamped to only 1 decimal place in earlier versions (_bug(672448_)).

As TCP is built into the kernel of many operating systems being able to experiment with changes, test them and implement modifications is an extremely slow process. The creation of QUIC allows developers to conduct experiments and try new things faster.

QUIC was designed to support the semantics of HTTP/2. It provides multiplexing, flow control, security and congestion control.

Key features of QUIC include:

- Reduction in connection establishment time.
- Improved congestion control.
- Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking.
- Forward error correction.
- Connection migration.

There is limited browser and server support for QUIC today.

The performance mantra of RAIL is "Focus on the user; the end goal isn't to make your site perform fast on any specific device, it's to make users happy." There are 4 stages of interaction: page load, idle, response to input, and scrolling and animation. In acronym order, the main tenets are:

- **Response**
- - : Respond to users immediately, acknowledging any user input in **100ms** or less.
- **Animation**
- - : When animating, render each frame in under **16ms**, aiming for consistency and avoiding jank.
- **Idle**
    - : When using the main JavaScript thread, work in chunks for less than **50ms** to free up the thread for user interactions.
- **Load**

## Examples

### Recursive function calls itself until condition met

The following Python code defines a function that takes a number, prints it, and then calls itself again with the number's value -1. It keeps going until the number is equal to 0, in which case it stops.

```js
def recurse(x):
   if x > 0:
       print(x)
       recurse(x - 1)

recurse(10)

The underlying resource is the same in each case, but its representation is different.

Clients specify the formats that they prefer to be sent during [content negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation) (using `Accept-*` headers), and the representation headers tell the client the format of the _selected representation_ they actually received.

Representation headers may be present in both HTTP request and response messages.
If sent as a response to a `HEAD` request, they describe the body content that _would_ be selected if the resource was actually requested.

Representation headers include: _HTTPHeader("Content-Type"_), _HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding"_), _HTTPHeader("Content-Language"_), and _HTTPHeader("Content-Location"_).

## Term: Request header

- Glossary
- WebMechanics

---

> A **request header** is an _glossary("HTTP header"_) that can be used in an HTTP request to provide information about the request context, so that the server can tailor the response. For example, the _HTTPHeader("Accept", "Accept-\*"_) headers indicate the allowed and preferred formats of the response. Other headers can be used to supply authentication credentials (e.g. _HTTPHeader("Authorization"_)), to control caching, or to get information about the user agent or referrer, etc.

Not all headers that can appear in a request are referred to as _request headers_ by the specification. For example, the _HTTPHeader("Content-Type"_) header is referred to as a _glossary("representation header"_).

In addition, [CORS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) defines a subset of request headers as _glossary('simple header', 'simple headers'_), request headers that are always considered authorized and are not explicitly listed in responses to _glossary("preflight request", "preflight"_) requests.

The HTTP message below shows a few request headers after a _HTTPMethod("GET"_) request:

```bash

## Term: Response header

- Glossary
- WebMechanics

---

> A **response header** is an _glossary("HTTP header"_) that can be used in an HTTP response and that doesn't relate to the content of the message. Response headers, like _HTTPHeader("Age"_), _HTTPHeader("Location"_) or _HTTPHeader("Server"_) are used to give a more detailed context of the response.

Not all headers appearing in a response are categorized as _response headers_ by the specification. For example, the _HTTPHeader("Content-Type"_) header is a _glossary("representation header"_) indicating the original type of data in the body of the response message (prior to the encoding in the _HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding"_) representation header being applied). However, "conversationally" all headers are usually referred to as response headers in a response message.

The following shows a few response and representation headers after a _HTTPMethod("GET"_) request.

> **REST** (Representational State Transfer) refers to a group of software architecture design constraints that bring about efficient, reliable and scalable distributed systems.

The basic idea of REST is that a resource, e.g. a document, is transferred via well-recognized, language-agnostic, and reliably standardized client/server interactions. Services are deemed RESTful when they adhere to these constraints.

HTTP APIs in general are sometimes colloquially referred to as RESTful APIs, RESTful services, or REST services, although they don't necessarily adhere to all REST constraints. Beginners can assume a REST API means an HTTP service that can be called using standard web libraries and tools.

## Term: RGB

- Beginner
- CSS
- Design
- Guide

---

> Red Green Blue (RGB) is a color model that represents colors as mixtures of three underlying components (or channels), namely, red, green, and blue. Each color is described by a sequence of three numbers (typically between 0.0 and 1.0, or between 0 and 255) that represent the different intensities (or contributions) of red, green, and blue, in determining the final color.

There are many ways to describe the RGB components of a color. In _Glossary("CSS"_) they can be represented as a single 24-bit integer in hexadecimal notation (for example, ` #``add `8e6 is light blue), or in functional notation as three separate 8-bit integers (for example, rgb(46, 139, 87) is sea green). In _Glossary("OpenGL"_), _Glossary("WebGL"_), and _Glossary("GLSL"_) the red-green-blue components are fractions (floating-point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0), although in the actual color buffer they are typically stored as 8-bit integers. Graphically, a color can be represented as a point in a three-dimensional grid or cube, where each dimension (or axis) corresponds to a different channel.

## Term: Random Number Generator

- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> A **PRNG** (pseudorandom number generator) is an algorithm that outputs numbers in a complex, seemingly unpredictable pattern. Truly random numbers (say, from a radioactive source) are utterly unpredictable, whereas all algorithms are predictable, and a PRNG returns the same numbers when passed the same starting parameters or _seed_.

PRNGs can be used for a variety of applications, such as games.

A cryptographically secure PRNG is a PRNG with certain extra properties making it suitable for use in cryptography. These include:

- that it's computationally unfeasible for an attacker (without knowledge of the seed) to predict its output
- that if an attacker can work out its current state, this should not enable the attacker to work out previously emitted numbers.

Most PRNGs are not cryptographically secure.

> There are three definitions for **routers** on the web:

1.  For the network layer, the router is a networking device that decides data _Glossary('Packet'_)s directions. They are distributed by retailers allowing user interaction to the internet.
2.  For a _Glossary('SPA', 'Single-page application' _) in the application layer, a router is a library that decides what web page is presented by a given _Glossary('URL'_). This middleware module is used for all URL functions, as these are given a path to a file that is rendered to open the next page.
3.  In the implementation of an _Glossary('API'_) in a service layer, a router is a software component that parses a request and directs or routes the request to various handlers within a program. The router code usually accepts a response from the handler and facilitates its return to the requester.

## Term: Rsync

---

> [Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) is an open-source file synchronizing tool that provides incremental file transfer It can be used over insecure and secure transports (like SSH). It is available on most Unix-based systems (such as macOS and Linux) and Windows. There are also GUI-based tools that use rsync, for example, [Acrosync](https://acrosync.com/mac.html).

A basic command looks like this:

```bash
rsync [-options] SOURCE user@x.x.x.x:DESTINATION
```

- `-options` is a dash followed by one or more letters, for example `-v` for verbose error messages, and `-b` to make backups. See the full list of options at the [rsync man page.](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) (Search for "Options summary.")
- `SOURCE` is the path to the local file or directory that you want to copy or synchronize
- `user@` is the credentials of the user on the remote server you want to copy files over to.
- `x.x.x.x` is the IP address of the remote server.
- `DESTINATION` is the path to the location you want to copy your directory or files to on the remote server.

You can also make a connection over SSH using the `-e` option as shown:

```bash
rsync [-options] -e "ssh [SSH DETAILS GO HERE]" SOURCE user@x.x.x.x:DESTINATION
```

There are numerous examples on the Internet, including those at the [official website](https://rsync.samba.org/examples.html), and at the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync#Examples) for rsync.

> The **RTP Control Protocol** (**RTCP**) is a partner to the _Glossary("RTP"_) protocol. RTCP is used to provide control and statistical information about an RTP media streaming session.

This lets control and statistics packets be separated logically and functionally from the media streaming while using the underlying packet delivery layer to transmit the RTCP signals as well as the RTP and media contents.

RTCP periodically transmits control packets to all of an RTP session's participants, using the same mechanism that is being used to transmit the data packets. That underlying protocol handles the multiplexing of the data and control packets and may use separate network ports for each type of packet.

---

> The current context of execution. The context in which _glossary("value","values"_) and **expressions** are "visible" or can be referenced. If a **_glossary("variable"_)** or other expression is not "in the current scope," then it is unavailable for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.

A **_glossary("function"_)** serves as a **closure** in _glossary("JavaScript"_), and thus creates a scope, so that (for example) a variable defined exclusively within the function cannot be accessed from outside the function or within other functions. For instance, the following is invalid:

---


```js


function exampleFunction() {
    var x = 'declared inside function'; // x can only be used in exampleFunction
    console.log('Inside function');
    console.log(x);
}

console.log(x); // Causes error
```

However, the following code is valid due to the variable being declared outside the function, making it global:

```js
var x = 'declared outside function';

exampleFunction();

function exampleFunction() {
    console.log('Inside function');
    console.log(x);
}

console.log('Outside function');
console.log(x);

> Screen readers are software applications that attempt to convey what is seen on a screen display in a non-visual way, usually as text to speech, but also into braille or sound icons. Screen readers are essential to people who are blind, as well as useful to people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability. There are some browser extension screen readers, but most screen readers operate system-wide for all user applications, not just the browser.

In terms of web accessibility, most user agents provide an accessibility object model and screen readers interact with dedicated accessibility APIs, using various operating system features and employing hooking techniques.

## VoiceOver

macOS comes with VoiceOver, a built-in screen reader. To access VoiceOver, go to System Preferences > Accessibility > VoiceOver. You can also toggle VoiceOver on and off with fn+command + F5. VoiceOver both reads aloud and displays content. The content read aloud is displayed in a dark grey box.

Desktop/laptop screen reader users navigate websites with a keyboard or other non-pointing device. The best way to emulate use is to do the same.

Just like keyboard navigation without VoiceOver, you can navigate through interactive elements using the tab key and the arrow keys:

- Next interactive element: Tab
- Previous interactive element: Shift + Tab
- Next radio button in a same named-group: right or down arrow
- Previous radio button in a same named-group: left or up arrow

Navigating through the content of a page is done with the tab key and a series of other keys along with Control + Option keys

- Next heading: Control + Option + H
- Next list: Control + Option + X
- Next graphic: Control + Option + G
- Next table: Control + Option + T
- Down an HTML hierarchical order Control + Option + right arrow
- Previous heading: Shift + Control + Option + H
- Previous list: Shift + Control + Option + X
- Previous graphic: Shift + Control + Option + G

> A search engine is a software system that collects information from the _Glossary("World Wide Web"_) and presents it to users who are looking for specific information.

A search engine conducts the following processes:

- **Web crawling:** Searching web sites by navigating _Glossary("Hyperlink", "Hyperlinks"_) on web pages, both within a site, and from one site to another. A web site owner can exclude areas of the site from being accessed by a search engine's _web crawler_ (or _spider_), by defining "robot exclusion" information in a file named `robots.txt`.
- **Indexing:** Associating keywords and other information with specific web pages that have been crawled. This enables users to find relevant pages as quickly as possible.
- **Searching:** Looking for relevant web pages based on queries consisting of key words and other commands to the search engine. The search engine finds the URLs of pages that match the query, and ranks them based on their relevance. It then presents results to the user in order of the ranking.

The most popular search engine is Google. Other top search engines include Yahoo!, Bing, Baidu, and AOL.

> A Second Level Domain (_Glossary("SLD"_)) is the part of the domain name that is located right before a Top Level Domain (_Glossary("TLD"_)).

For example, in `mozilla.org` the SLD is `mozilla` and the TLD is `org`.

A domain name is not limited to a TLD and an SLD. Additional subdomains can be created in order to provide additional information about various functions of a server or to delimit areas under the same domain. For example, `www` is a commonly used subdomain to indicate the domain points to a web server.

As another example, in `developer.mozilla.org`, the `developer` subdomain is used to specify that the subdomain contains the developer section of the Mozilla website.

From the _glossary("hash"_) of a given message, the **signing process** first generates a digital signature linked to the signing entity, using the entity's private _glossary("key"_).

On receiving the message, the **verification process**

- _authenticates the sender -_ uses the sender's public key to _glossary("decryption","decrypt"_) the signature and recover the hash, which can only be created with the sender's private key, and
- _checks message integrity -_ compares the hash with a newly calculated one from the received document (the two hashes will differ if the document has been tampered with)

The system fails if the private key is compromised or the recipient is deceitfully given the wrong public key.

## Term: Semantics

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- HTML
- semantics

---

> In programming, **Semantics** refers to the _meaning_ of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

## Semantics in JavaScript

In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an _htmlelement("li"_) element with that string as its `textContent`. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called `build('Peach')`, or `createLiWithContent('Peach')`?

## Semantics in CSS

In CSS, consider styling a list with `li` elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with `div > ul > li`, or `.fruits__item`?

## Semantics in HTML

In HTML, for example, the _htmlelement("h1"_) element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

```html
<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
```

By default, most browser's [user agent stylesheet](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade#user-agent_stylesheets) will style an _htmlelement("h1"_) with a large font size to make it _look_ like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).

On the other hand, you could make any element _look_ like a top level heading. Consider the following:

```html
<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;">Is this a top level heading?</span>
```

This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.

HTML should be coded to represent the _data_ that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see _glossary("SEO"_))
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless `div`s with or without semantic or namespaced classes
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.

## Semantic elements

These are _some_ of the roughly 100 semantic [elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) available:

- _htmlelement("article"_)
- _htmlelement("aside"_)
- _htmlelement("details"_)
- _htmlelement("figcaption"_)
- _htmlelement("figure"_)
- _htmlelement("footer"_)
- _htmlelement("header"_)
- _htmlelement("main"_)
- _htmlelement("mark"_)
- _htmlelement("nav"_)
- _htmlelement("section"_)
- _htmlelement("summary"_)
- _htmlelement("time"_)

## Term: SEO

---

> **SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.

Search engines _Glossary("Crawler", "crawl"_) the web, following links from page to page, and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (for ecommerce and ads).

Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents.

SEO methods fall into three broad classes:

- technical
- - : Tag the content using semantic _Glossary("HTML"_). When exploring the website, crawlers should only find the content you want indexed.
- copywriting
    - : Write content using your visitors' vocabulary. Use text as well as images so that crawlers can understand the subject.
- popularity
    - : You get most traffic when other established sites link to your site.

---

> A server is a software or hardware offering a service to a user, usually referred to as client. A hardware server is a shared computer on a network, usually powerful and housed in a data center. A software server (often running on a hardware server) is a program that provides services to client programs or a _glossary("UI","user interface"_) to human clients.

Services are provided generally over local area networks or wide area networks such as the internet. A client program and server program traditionally connect by passing messages encoded using a _glossary("protocol"_) over an _glossary("API"_).

For example:

- An Internet-connected Web server is sending a _glossary("HTML"_) file to your browser software so that you can read this page
- Local area network server for file, name, mail, print, and fax
- Minicomputers, mainframes, and super computers at data centers

## Term: Session Hijacking

- Glossary
- Security
- session hijacking

---

> **Session hijacking** occurs when an attacker takes over a valid session between two computers. The attacker steals a valid session ID in order to break into the system and snoop data.

Most authentication occurs only at the start of a _glossary("TCP"_) session. In TCP session hijacking, an attacker gains access by taking over a TCP session between two machines in mid session.

![](session_hijacking_3.jpg)

### Session hijacking occurs because

- no account lockout for invalid session IDs
- weak session-ID generation algorithm
- insecure handling
- indefinite session expiration time
- short session IDs
- transmission in plain text

### Session hijacking process

1.  **Sniff**, that is perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, place yourself between victim and server.
2.  **Monitor** packets flowing between server and user.
3.  **Break** the victim machine's connection.
4.  **Take control** of the session.
5.  **Inject** new packets to the server using the Victim's Session ID.

### Protection against session hijacking

- create a secure communication channel with SSH (secure shell)
- pass authentication cookies over HTTPS connection
- implement logout functionality so the user can end the session
- generate the session ID after successful login
- pass encrypted data between the users and the web server
- use a string or long random number as a session key

A shadow tree is a hidden set of standard DOM nodes which is attached to a standard DOM node that serves as a host. The hidden nodes are not directly visible using regular DOM functionality, but require the use of a special [Shadow DOM API](/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to access.

Nodes within the shadow tree are not affected by anything applied outside the shadow tree, and vice versa. This provides a way to encapsulate implementation details, which is especially useful for custom elements and other advanced design paradigms.

> The _site_ of a piece of web content is determined by the _registrable domain_ of the host within the origin. This is computed by consulting a _Public Suffix List_ to find the portion of the host which is counted as the _public suffix_ (e.g. `com`, `org` or `co.uk`).

The concept of a _site_ is used in [SameSite cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#directives), as well as a web application's [Cross-Origin Resource Policy](</en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cross-Origin_Resource_Policy_(CORP)>).

## Term: Speculative parsing

- Advanced
- HTML
- HTML5
- NeedsUpdate
- Web Development
- Web Performance

---

> Traditionally in browsers the HTML parser ran on the main thread and was blocked after a `</script>` tag until the script has been retrieved from the network and executed. Some HTML parser, such as Firefox since Firefox 4, support speculative parsing off of the main thread. It parses ahead while scripts are being downloaded and executed. The HTML parser starts speculative loads for scripts, style sheets and images it finds ahead in the stream and runs the HTML tree construction algorithm speculatively. The upside is that when a speculation succeeds, there's no need to reparse the part of the incoming file that was already scanned for scripts, style sheets and images. The downside is that there's more work lost when the speculation fails.

This document helps you avoid the kind of things that make speculation fail and slow down the loading of your page.

To make speculative loads of linked scripts, style sheets and images successful, avoid _domxref('document.write'_). If you use a `<base>` element to override the base URI of your page, put the element in the non-scripted part of the document. Don't add it via `document.write()` or _domxref('document.createElement'_).

## Avoiding losing tree builder output

Speculative tree building fails when `document.write()` changes the tree builder state such that the speculative state after the `</script>` tag no longer holds when all the content inserted by `document.write()` has been parsed. However, only unusual uses of `document.write()` cause trouble. Here are the things to avoid:

- Don't write unbalanced trees. `<script>document.write("<div>");</script>` is bad. `<script>document.write("<div></div>");</script>` is OK.
- Don't write an unfinished token. `<script>document.write("<div></div");</script>` is bad.
- Don't finish your writing with a carriage return. `<script>document.write("Hello World!\r");</script>` is bad. `<script>document.write("Hello World!\n");</script>` is OK.
- Don't format part of a table. `<table><script>document.write("<tr><td>Hello World!</td></tr>");</script></table>` is bad.

![](updates_loginscreen.png)

After entering username and password, behind the GUI the SQL queries work as follows:

```sql
"SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' " + txt.User.Text+" ' AND Password=' "+ txt.Password.Text+" ' ";
```

Now suppose User enters the User## Term: admin and Password: passwd123, so after clicking on the Log in button, SQL query will run as follows:

```sql
"SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' admin ' AND Password=' passwd123 ' ";
```

If the credentials are correct, then the user is allowed to log in, so it's a very simple (and therefore insecure) mechanism. Hackers use this insecurity to gain unauthorized access.

Hackers use a simple string called a Magical String, for example:

**User## Term: _admin_**

**Password: _anything 'or'1'='1_**

After clicking on the login button, the SQL query will work as follows:

```sql
"SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' admin ' AND Password=' anything 'or'1'='1 ' ";
```

Just take a closer look at the above query's password section.

    Password=' anything 'or'1'='1 '

The password is not 'anything', hence password=anything results in FALSE, but '1'='1' is a TRUE statement and hence returns a TRUE value. Finally, due to the OR operator, the value ( FALSE OR TRUE ) is TRUE, so authentication bypasses successfully. Just due to a simple string (Magical String) the entire database is compromised.

## How To Prevent

Before executing the queries for the user credentials, make some changes like the following:

```sql
$id = $_GET['id']

(1) $id = Stripslashes($id)

(2) $id = mysql_real_escape_String($id)
```

So due to (1) each single quote (') in the input string is replaced with double quotes ("), and due to (2) before every (') it adds (/). The revised magical string fails to bypass the authentication, and your database stays secure.

---

> A state machine is a mathematical abstraction used to design algorithms. A state machine reads a set of inputs and changes to a different state based on those inputs.

A state is a description of the status of a system waiting to execute a transition. A transition is a set of actions to execute when a condition is fulfilled or an event received. In a state diagram, circles represent each possible state and arrows represent transitions between states.

Looking at the final state, you can discern something about the series of inputs leading to that state.

There are two types of basic state machines:

- deterministic finite state machine
- - : This kind allows only one possible transition for any allowed input. This is like the "if" _Glossary("statement"_) in that `if x == true then doThis else doThat` is not possible. The computer must perform _one_ of the two options.
- non-deterministic finite state machine
    - : Given some state, an input can lead to more than one different state.

_Figure 1: Deterministic Finite State Machine_

![](statemachine1.png)

In _Figure 1_, the state begins in State 1; the state changes to State 2 given input 'X', or to State 3 given input 'Y'.

_Figure 2: Non-Deterministic Finite State Machine_

[![](statemachine2.png)](http://postimg.org/image/mpq3nz82h/)

In _Figure 2_, given input 'X', the state can persist or change to State 2.

Note that any _Glossary("regular expression"_) can be represented by a state machine.

---

> A static method (or _static function_) is a _Glossary("method"_) defined as a member of an _Glossary("object"_) but is accessible directly from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.

In a [Web API](/en-US/docs/Web/API), a static method is one which is defined by an interface but can be called without instantiating an object of that type first.

Methods called on object instances are called _instance methods_.

## Examples

In the [Notifications API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API), the _domxref("Notification.requestPermission()"_) method is called on the actual _domxref("Notification"_) constructor itself — it is a static method:

```js
let promise = Notification.requestPermission();
```

The _domxref("Notification.close()"_) method on the other hand, is an instance method — it is called on an specific notification object instance to close the system notification it represents:

```js
let myNotification = new Notification('This is my notification');

myNotification.close();
```

---

> In _Glossary("CSS"_), there are three categories of sources for style changes. These categories are called **style origins**. They are the **user agent origin**, **user origin**, and the **author origin**.

- User-agent origin
- - : The user agent origin is the style origin comprised of the default styles used by the user's web browser. If no other styles are applied to content, the user agent origin's styles are used while rendering elements.
- User origin
    - : The user origin is the style origin containing any CSS that the user of the web browser has added. These may be from adding styles using a developer tool or from a browser extension that automatically applies custom styles to content, such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) or [Stylish](https://userstyles.org/).
- Author origin
    - : The author origin is the style origin which contains all of the styles which are part of the document, whether embedded within the _Glossary("HTML"_) or loaded from an external stylesheet file.

The style origins are used to determine where to stop rolling back (or backtracking through) the cascade of styles that have been applied to an element when removing styles, such as when using the _cssxref("unset"_) or _cssxref("revert"_) keywords.

External stylesheets are generally preferred because they allow you to control the styling of multiple pages from a single place, rather than having to repeat the CSS across each page.

## Term: Symbol

- Data Type
- ECMAScript 2015
- Glossary
- JavaScript
- Sharing
- Symbol

---

> In _Glossary("JavaScript"_), Symbol is a _Glossary("Primitive", "primitive value"_).

A value having the data type **Symbol** can be referred to as a "Symbol value". In a JavaScript runtime environment, a symbol value is created by invoking the function _jsxref("Symbol"_), which dynamically produces an anonymous, unique value. A symbol may be used as an object property.

Symbol can have an optional description, but for debugging purposes only.

A **Symbol** value represents a unique identifier. For example:

```js
// Here are two symbols with the same description:
let Sym1 = Symbol('Sym');
let Sym2 = Symbol('Sym');

console.log(Sym1 === Sym2); // returns "false"
// Symbols are guaranteed to be unique.
// Even if we create many symbols with the same description,
// they are different values.
```

> **Note:** If you are familiar with Ruby (or another language) that also has a feature called _"symbols"_, please don't be misled. JavaScript symbols are different.

_Symbol_ type is a new feature in ECMAScript 2015. There is no ECMAScript 5 equivalent for Symbol.

In some programming languages, the symbol data type is referred to as an "atom."

### Symbols don't "Auto-Convert" to strings

Most values in JavaScript support implicit conversion to a string. For instance, we can `alert` almost any value, and it will work. Symbols are special. They don't auto-convert.

For example:

```js
let Sym = Symbol('Sym');
alert(Sym); // TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string
```

That's a "language guard" against messing up, because strings and symbols are fundamentally different, and should not occasionally convert one into another.

If you really want to show a symbol, we need to call `.toString()` on it.

```js
let Sym = Symbol('Sym');
alert(Sym.toString()); // Symbol(Sym), now it works
```

Or you can use the `symbol.description` property to get its description:

```js
let _Sym = Symbol('Sym');

alert(_Sym.description); // Sym
```

### Well-known symbols

The _jsxref("Symbol"_) class has constants for so-called _well-known symbols_. These symbols let you configure how JS treats an object, by using them as property keys.

Examples of well-known symbols are: _jsxref("Symbol.iterator"_) for array-like objects, or _jsxref("Symbol.search"_) for string objects.

They are listed in the specification in the [Well-known symbols](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-well-known-symbols) table:

- `Symbol.hasInstance`
- `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`
- `Symbol.iterator`
- `Symbol.toPrimitive`
- …and so on.

### Global symbol registry

There is a global symbol registry holding all available symbols. The methods that access the registry are _jsxref("Symbol.for()"_) and _jsxref("Symbol.keyFor()"_); these mediate between the global symbol table (or "registry") and the run-time environment. The global symbol registry is mostly built by JavaScript's compiler infrastructure, and the global symbol registry's content is not available to JavaScript's run-time infrastructure, except through these reflective methods.

The method `Symbol.for(tokenString)` returns a symbol value from the registry, and `Symbol.keyFor(symbolValue)` returns a token string from the registry; each is the other's inverse, so the following is `true`:

```js
Symbol.keyFor(Symbol.for('tokenString')) === 'tokenString'; // true
```

## Term: Symmetric-key cryptography

- Cryptography
- Glossary
- Security
- Symmetric-key cryptography

---

> Symmetric-key cryptography is a term used for cryptographic algorithms that use the same key for encryption and for decryption. The key is usually called a "symmetric key" or a "secret key".

This is usually contrasted with _Glossary("public-key cryptography"_), in which keys are generated in pairs and the transformation made by one key can only be reversed using the other key.

Symmetric-key algorithms should be secure when used properly and are highly efficient, so they can be used to encrypt large amounts of data without having a negative effect on performance.

Most symmetric-key algorithms currently in use are block ciphers: this means that they encrypt data one block at a time. The size of each block is fixed and determined by the algorithm: for example _Glossary("AES"_) uses 16-byte blocks. Block ciphers are always used with a \__Glossary("Block cipher mode of operation", "mode"_)\_, which specifies how to securely encrypt messages that are longer than the block size. For example, AES is a cipher, while CTR, CBC, and GCM are all modes. Using an inappropriate mode, or using a mode incorrectly, can completely undermine the security provided by the underlying cipher.

## Term: Syntax

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- Syntax

---

> Syntax specifies the required combination and sequence of _Glossary("character","characters"_) making up correctly structured code. Syntax generally includes grammar and the rules that apply to writing it, such as indentation requirements in Python.

Syntax varies from language to language (e.g., syntax is different in _Glossary("HTML"_) and _Glossary("JavaScript"_)). Although languages can share few similarities in terms of their syntaxes for example "operand operator operand" rule in javaScript and python. This does not mean the two languages share similarities with syntax.

Syntax applies both to programming languages (commands to the computer) and markup languages (document structure information) alike.

Syntax only governs ordering and structure; the instructions must also be _meaningful_, which is the province of _Glossary("semantics"_).

Code must have correct syntax in order to _Glossary("compile"_) correctly, otherwise a _Glossary("syntax error"_) occurs. Even small errors, like a missing parenthesis, can stop source code from compiling successfully.

Frameworks are said to have a "clean" syntax if they produce simple, readable, concise results. If a codebase uses "a lot of syntax", it requires more characters to achieve the same functionality.

---

> **Synthetic monitoring** involves monitoring the performance of a page in a 'laboratory' environment, typically with automation tooling in an environment that is as consistent as possible.

With a consistent baseline, synthetic monitoring is good for measuring the effects of code changes on performance. However, it doesn't necessarily reflect what users are experiencing.

Synthetic Monitoring involves deploying scripts to simulate the path an end-user might take through a web application, reporting back the performance of the simulator experiences. Examples of popular synthetic monitoring tools include [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org) and [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/). The traffic measured is not of your actual users, but rather synthetically generated traffic collecting data on page performance.

Unlike [RUM](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Real_User_Monitoring), synthetic monitoring provides a narrow view of performance that doesn't account for user differences, making it useful in getting basic data about an application's performance and spot-checking performance in development environments. Combined with other tools, such as network throttling, can provide excellent insight into potential problem areas.

---

> _glossary('Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)','TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)'_) uses a **three-way handshake** (aka TCP-handshake, three message handshake, and/or SYN-SYN-ACK) to set up a TCP/IP connection over an IP based network.

The three messages transmitted by TCP to negotiate and start a TCP session are nicknamed SYN, _SYN-ACK_, and ACK for **SYN**chronize, **SYN**chronize-**ACK**nowledgement, and **ACK**nowledge respectively. The three message mechanism is designed so that two computers that want to pass information back and forth to each other can negotiate the parameters of the connection before transmitting data such as HTTP browser requests.

The host, generally the browser, sends a TCP SYNchronize packet to the server. The server receives the SYN and sends back a SYNchronize-ACKnowledgement. The host receives the server's SYN-ACK and sends an ACKnowledge. The server receives ACK and the TCP socket connection is established.

This handshake step happens after a _glossary('DNS', 'DNS lookup'_) and before the _glossary('TLS'_) handshake, when creating a secure connection. The connection can be terminated independently by each side of the connection via a four-way handshake.

## Term: TCP slow start

- Glossary
- Infrastructure
- Networking
- TCP
- Transmission Control Protocol
- Web Performance
- data

---

> _glossary('TCP'_) slow start helps buildup transmission speeds to the network's capabilities. It does this without initially knowing what those capabilities are and without creating congestion. _glossary('TCP'_) slow start is an algorithm used to detect the available bandwidth for packet transmission, and balances the speed of a network connection. It prevents the appearance of network congestion whose capabilities are initially unknown, and slowly increases the volume of information diffused until the network's maximum capacity is found.

To implement TCP slow start, the congestion window (_cwnd_) sets an upper limit on the amount of data a source can transmit over the network before receiving an acknowledgment (ACK). The slow start threshold (_ssthresh_) determines the (de)activation of slow start. When a new connection is made, cwnd is initialized to one TCP data or acknowledgment packet, and waits for an acknowledgement, or ACK. When that ACK is received, the congestion window is incremented until the _cwnd_ is greater than _ssthresh_. Slow start also terminates when congestion is experienced.

## Congestion control

Congestion itself is a state that happens within a network layer when the message traffic is too busy it slows the network response time. The server sends data in TCP packets, the user's client then confirms delivery by returning acknowledgements, or ACKs. The connection has a limited capacity depending on hardware and network conditions. If the server sends too many packets too quickly, they will be dropped. Meaning, there will be no acknowledgement. The server registers this as missing ACKs. Congestion control algorithms use this flow of sent packets and ACKs to determine a send rate.

TCP guarantees the delivery of data and packets in the same order as they were sent. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who were DARPA scientists at the time, designed TCP in the 1970s.

TCP's role is to ensure the packets are reliably delivered, error free. TCP has concurrence control, which means the initial requests start small, increasing in size to the levels of bandwidth the computers, servers, and network can support.

It is not to be confused with pixel which is the unit of screen space. This is one of the main differences between Texel's and pixels, pixels are image data. Texel components are made up of subjective data, therefore they can be an image as well as a depth map.

The process of mapping the appropriate Texel's to their corresponding points on a polygon is called **texture mapping**, which is a stage of the process of rendering a 3D image for display. Texture mapping is typically done prior to lighting the scene; however, in WebGL, lighting is performed as part of the texture mapping process.

Textures are characterised by collections of Texel's, as how images are characterised by collections of pixels. When texture mapping occurs the renderer maps Texel's to the appropriate pixels.

## Term: Thread

- Glossary
- Thread

---

> Thread in computer science is the execution of running multiple tasks or programs at the same time. Each unit capable of executing code is called a **thread**.

However, modern _Glossary("JavaScript"_) offers ways to create additional threads, each executing independently while possibly communicating between one another. This is done using technologies such as **[web workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API)**, which can be used to spin off a sub-program which runs concurrently with the main thread in a thread of its own. This allows slow, complex, or long-running tasks to be executed independently of the main thread, preserving the overall performance of the site or app—as well as that of the browser overall. This also allows individuals to take advantage of modern multi-core processors.

A special type of worker, called a **[service worker](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)**, can be created which can be left behind by a site—with the user's permission—to run even when the user isn't currently using that site. This is used to create sites capable of notifying the user when things happen while they're not actively engaged with a site. Such as notifying a user they have received new email even though they're not currently logged into their mail service.

Overall it can be observed these threads within our operating system are extremely helpful. They help minimize the context switching time, enables more efficient communication and allows further use of the multiprocessor architecture.

> **Time to Interactive** (TTI) is a non-standardized web performance 'progress' metric defined as the point in time when the last [Long Task](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Long_Tasks_API) finished and was followed by 5 seconds of network and main thread inactivity.

TTI, proposed by the Web Incubator Community Group in 2018, is intended to provide a metric that describes when a page or application contains useful content and the main thread is idle and free to respond to user interactions, including having event handlers registered.

#### Caveat:

TTI is derived by leveraging information from the _domxref("Long Tasks API"_). Although available in some performance monitoring tools, TTI is not a part of any official web specification at the time of writing.

## Term: TLD

- Glossary
- Web
- WebMechanics

---

> A TLD (_top-level domain_) is the most generic _Glossary("domain"_) in the Internet's hierarchical _Glossary("DNS"_) (domain name system). A TLD is the final component of a _Glossary("domain name"_), for example, "org" in `developer.mozilla.org`.

_Glossary("ICANN"_) (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) designates organizations to manage each TLD. Depending on how strict an administrating organization might be, TLD often serves as a clue to the purpose, ownership, or nationality of a website.

Consider an example Internet address: `https://developer.mozilla.org`
Here org is the TLD; mozilla.org is the second-level domain name; and developer is a subdomain name. All together, these constitute a fully-qualified domain name; the addition of https\:// makes this a complete URL.

_Glossary("IANA"_) today distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:

- country-code top-level domains (ccTLD)
- - : Two-character domains established for countries or territories. Example: _.us_ for United States.
- internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD)
- - : ccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic or Chinese).
- generic top-level domains (gTLD)
- - : Top-level domains with three or more characters.
- unsponsored top-level domains
    - : Domains that operate directly under policies established by ICANN processes for the global Internet community, for example "com" and "edu".
- sponsored top-level domains (sTLD)
    - : These domains are proposed and sponsored by private organizations that decide whether an applicant is eligible to use the TLD, based on community theme concepts.
- infrastructure top-level domain
    - : This group consists of one domain, the _Glossary("ARPA", "Address and Routing Parameter Area"_) (ARPA).

## Term: Transport Layer Security (TLS)

---

> **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**, formerly known as _Glossary("SSL", "Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)"_), is a _Glossary("protocol"_) used by applications to communicate securely across a network, preventing tampering with and eavesdropping on email, web browsing, messaging, and other protocols. Both SSL and TLS are client / server protocols that ensure communication privacy by using cryptographic protocols to provide security over a network. When a server and client communicate using TLS, it ensures that no third party can eavesdrop or tamper with any message.

All modern browsers support the TLS protocol, requiring the server to provide a valid _Glossary("Digital certificate", "digital certificate"_) confirming its identity in order to establish a secure connection. It is possible for both the client and server to mutually authenticate each other, if both parties provide their own individual digital certificates.

> **Note:** TLS 1.0 and 1.1 support will be removed from all major browsers in early 2020; you'll need to make sure your web server supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3 going forward. From version 74 onwards, Firefox will return a [Secure Connection Failed](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/secure-connection-failed-firefox-did-not-connect) error when connecting to servers using the older TLS versions (_bug(1606734_)).

## Term: TOFU

- HTTP

> **Trust On First Use** **(TOFU**) is a security model in which a client needs to create a trust relationship with an unknown server. To do that, clients will look for identifiers (for example public keys) stored locally. If an identifier is found, the client can establish the connection. If no identifier is found, the client can prompt the user to determine if the client should trust the identifier.

TOFU is used in the SSH protocol, in [HTTP Public Key Pinning](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning) (_Glossary("HPKP"_)) where the browsers will accept the first public key returned by the server, and in _HTTPHeader("Strict-Transport-Security"_) (_Glossary("HSTS"_)) where a browser will obey the redirection rule.

## Term: Transferable objects

- Transferable
- Workers

---

> **Transferable objects** are objects that own resources that can be _transferred_ from one context to another, ensuring that the resources are only available in one context at a time.
> Following a transfer, the original object is no longer usable; it no longer points to the transferred resource, and any attempt to read or write the object will throw an exception.

_Transferrable objects_ are commonly use to share resources that can only be safely exposed to a single JavaScript thread at a time.
For example, an _jsxref("ArrayBuffer"_) is a transferrable object that owns a block of memory.
When such a buffer is transferred between threads, the associated memory resource is detached from the original buffer and attached to the buffer object created in the new thread.
The buffer object in the original thread is no longer usable because it no longer owns a memory resource.

Transferring may also be used when creating deep copies of objects with _domxref("structuredClone()"_).
Following the cloning operation, the transferred resources are moved rather than copied to the cloned object.

The mechanism used to transfer an object's resources depends on the object.
For example, when an _jsxref("ArrayBuffer"_) is transferred between threads, the memory resource that it points to is _literally_ moved between contexts in a fast and efficient zero-copy operation.
Other objects may be transferred by copying the associated resource and then deleting it from the old context.

Not all objects are transferable.
A list of transferable objects is [provided below](#supported_objects).

## Transferring objects between threads

The code below demonstrates how transferring works when sending a message from a main thread to a _domxref("Web Workers API", "web worker thread","","true"_).
The _jsxref("Uint8Array"_) is copied (duplicated) in the worker while its buffer is transferred.
After transfer any attempt to read or write `uInt8Array` from the main thread will throw, but you can still check the `byteLength` to confirm it is now zero.

```js
// Create an 8MB "file" and fill it.
var uInt8Array = new Uint8Array(1024 * 1024 * 8); // 8MB
for (var i = 0; i < uInt8Array.length; ++i) {
    uInt8Array[i] = i;
}
console.log(uInt8Array.byteLength); // 8388608

// Transfer the underlying buffer to a worker
worker.postMessage(uInt8Array, [uInt8Array.buffer]);
console.log(uInt8Array.byteLength); // 0
```

> **Note:** [Typed arrays](en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) like _jsxref("Int32Array"_) and _jsxref("Uint8Array"_), are serializable, but not transferable.
> However their underlying buffer is an _jsxref("ArrayBuffer"_), which is a transferable object.
> We could have sent `uInt8Array.buffer` in the data parameter, but not `uInt8Array` in the transfer array.

### Transferring during a cloning operation

The code below shows a _domxref("structuredClone()"_) operation where the underlying buffer is copied from the original object to the clone.

```js
const original = new Uint8Array(1024);
const clone = structuredClone(original);
console.log(original.byteLength); // 1024
console.log(clone.byteLength); // 1024

original[0] = 1;
console.log(clone[0]); // 0

// Transferring the Uint8Array would throw an exception as it is not a transferrable object
// const transferred = structuredClone(original, {transfer: [original]});

// We can transfer Uint8Array.buffer.
const transferred = structuredClone(original, { transfer: [original.buffer] });
console.log(transferred.byteLength); // 1024
console.log(transferred[0]); // 1

// After transferring Uint8Array.buffer cannot be used.
console.log(original.byteLength); // 0
```

## Supported objects

The items that can be _transferred_ are:

- _jsxref("ArrayBuffer"_)
- _domxref("MessagePort"_)
- _domxref("ReadableStream"_)
- _domxref("WritableStream"_)
- _domxref("TransformStream"_)
- _domxref("AudioData"_)
- _domxref("ImageBitmap"_)
- _domxref("VideoFrame"_)
- _domxref("OffscreenCanvas"_)

## Term: Transient activation

- Transient activation
- Glossary
- JavaScript

---

> **Transient activation** (or "transient user activation") is a window state that indicates a user has recently pressed a button, moved a mouse, used a menu, or performed some other user interaction.

This state is sometimes used as a mechanism for ensuring that a web API can only function if triggered by user interaction.
For example, scripts cannot arbitrarily launch a popup that requires _transient activation_ ⁠—it must be triggered from a UI element's event handler.

Examples of APIs that require _transient activation_ are:

- _domxref("MediaDevices.selectAudioOutput()"_)

> **Note:** Transient activation expires after a timeout (if not renewed by further interaction), and may also be "consumed" by some APIs.

> **Tree shaking** is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.

It relies on the [import](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [export](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) statements in ES2015 to detect if code modules are exported and imported for use between JavaScript files.

In modern JavaScript applications, we use module bundlers (e.g., [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)) to automatically remove dead code when bundling multiple JavaScript files into single files. This is important for preparing code that is production ready, for example with clean structures and minimal file size.

## Term: Truthy

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- JavaScript

---

> In _Glossary("JavaScript"_), a **truthy** value is a value that is considered `true` when encountered in a _Glossary("Boolean"_) context. All values are truthy unless they are defined as _Glossary("Falsy", "falsy"_) (i.e., except for `false`, `0`, `-0`, `0n`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`).

_Glossary("JavaScript"_) uses _Glossary("Type_Coercion", "type coercion"_) in Boolean contexts.

Examples of _truthy_ values in JavaScript (which will be coerced to `true` in boolean contexts, and thus execute the `if` block):

```js
if (true)
if ({})
if ([])
if (42)
if ("0")
if ("false")
if (new Date())
if (-42)
if (12n)
if (3.14)
if (-3.14)
if (Infinity)
if (-Infinity)
```

### The logical AND operator, &&

If the first object is truthy, the [logical AND operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) returns the second operand:

```js
true && "dog"
// returns "dog"

[] && "dog"
// returns "dog"

## Caching

In the context of caching, TTL (as an unsigned 32-bit integer) being a part of the _Glossary("Response header", "HTTP response header"_) or the _Glossary("DNS"_) query, indicates the amount of time in seconds during which the resource can be cached by the requester.

## Term: Type coercion

- Coercion
- JavaScript
- Type coercion

---

> Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers). \__Glossary("Type conversion"_)_ is similar to \_type coercion_ because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference — _type coercion_ is implicit whereas _type conversion_ can be either implicit _or_ explicit.

## Examples

```js
const value1 = '5';
const value2 = 9;
let sum = value1 + value2;

console.log(sum);
```

In the above example, JavaScript has _coerced_ the `9` from a number into a string and then concatenated the two values together, resulting in a string of `59`. JavaScript had a choice between a string or a number and decided to use a string.

The compiler could have coerced the `5` into a number and returned a sum of `14`, but it did not. To return this result, you'd have to explicitly convert the `5` to a number using the _jsxref("Global_Objects/Number", "Number()"_) method:

```js
sum = Number(value1) + value2;
```

> Type conversion (or typecasting) means transfer of data from one data type to another. _Implicit conversion_ happens when the compiler automatically assigns data types, but the source code can also _explicitly_ require a conversion to take place. For example, given the instruction `5+2.0`, the floating point `2.0` is implicitly typecasted into an integer, but given the instruction `Number("0x11")`, the string "0x11" is explicitly typecasted as the number 17.

## Term: Type

- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> **Type** is a characteristic of a _glossary("value"_) affecting what kind of data it can store, and the structure that the data will adhere to. For example, a _Glossary("boolean"_) [Data Type](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures) can hold only a `true` or `false` value at any given time, whereas a _Glossary("string"_) has the ability to hold a string or a sequence of characters, a _Glossary("number"_) can hold numerical values of any kind, and so on.

A value's data type also affects the operations that are valid on that value. For example, a value of type number can be multiplied by another number, but not by a string - even if that string contains _only_ a number, such as the string "2".

Types also provides us with useful knowledge about the comparison between different values. Comparison between structured types is not always an easy assumption, as even if the previous data structure is the same, there could be inherited structures inside of the [Prototype Chain](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

If you are unsure of the type of a value, you can use the [`typeof`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) operator.

---

> **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) is a long standing _glossary("protocol"_) used together with _glossary("IPv6","IP"_) for sending data when transmission speed and efficiency matter more than security and reliability.

UDP uses a simple [connectionless communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication 'Connectionless communication') model with a minimum of protocol mechanism. UDP provides [checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) for data integrity, and [port numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_numbers 'Port numbers') for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no [handshaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking) dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any [unreliability](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(computer_networking)> 'Reliability (computer networking)') of the underlying network; There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. If error-correction facilities are needed at the network interface level, an application may use the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol 'Transmission Control Protocol') (TCP) or [Stream Control Transmission Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol 'Stream Control Transmission Protocol') (SCTP) which are designed for this purpose.

UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the [protocol stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack 'Protocol stack'). Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to [retransmission](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks)> 'Retransmission (data networks)'), which may not be an option in a [real-time system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_system 'Real-time system').

## Term: Unicode

> Unicode is a standard _Glossary("Character set","character set"_) that numbers and defines _Glossary("Character","characters"_) from the world's different languages, writing systems, and symbols.

By assigning each character a number, programmers can create _Glossary("Character encoding","character encodings"_), to let computers store, process, and transmit any combination of languages in the same file or program.

Before Unicode, it was difficult and error-prone to mix languages in the same data. For example, one character set would store Japanese characters, and another would store the Arabic alphabet. If it was not clearly marked which parts of the data were in which character set, other programs and computers would display the text incorrectly, or damage it during processing. If you've ever seen text where characters like curly quotes (`""`) were replaced with gibberish like `Ã‚Â£`, then you've seen this problem, known as _Interwiki("wikipedia", "Mojibake"_).

The most common Unicode character encoding on the Web is _Glossary("UTF-8"_). Other encodings exist, like UTF-16 or the obsolete UCS-2, but UTF-8 is recommended.

> **Uniform Resource Locator** (**URL**) is a text string that specifies where a resource (such as a web page, image, or video) can be found on the Internet.

In the context of _Glossary("HTTP"_), URLs are called "Web address" or "link". Your _glossary("browser"_) displays URLs in its address bar, for example: `https://developer.mozilla.org` Some browsers display only the part of a URL after the "//", that is, the _Glossary("Domain name"_).

URLs can also be used for file transfer (_Glossary("FTP"_)) , emails (_Glossary("SMTP"_)), and other applications.

> A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a _Glossary("Browser","browser"_) in a _Glossary("World Wide Web", "Web"_) context.

Besides a browser, a user agent could be a bot scraping webpages, a download manager, or another app accessing the Web. Along with each request they make to the server, browsers include a self-identifying _HTTPHeader("User-Agent"_) _Glossary("HTTP"_) header called a user agent (UA) string. This string often identifies the browser, its version number, and its host operating system.

Spam bots, download managers, and some browsers often send a fake UA string to announce themselves as a different client. This is known as _user agent spoofing_.

The user agent string can be accessed with _Glossary("JavaScript"_) on the client side using the _domxref("Navigator/userAgent", "NavigatorID.userAgent"_) property.

A typical user agent string looks like this: `"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0"`.

> UTF-8 (UCS Transformation Format 8) is the World Wide Web's most common _Glossary("Character encoding", "character encoding"_). Each character is represented by one to four bytes. UTF-8 is backward-compatible with _Glossary("ASCII"_) and can represent any standard Unicode character.

The first 128 UTF-8 characters precisely match the first 128 ASCII characters (numbered 0-127), meaning that existing ASCII text is already valid UTF-8. All other characters use two to four bytes. Each byte has some bits reserved for encoding purposes. Since non-ASCII characters require more than one byte for storage, they run the risk of being corrupted if the bytes are separated and not recombined.

## Term: UUID

- Glossary
- Infrastructure

---

> A **Universally Unique Identifier** (**UUID**) is a label used to uniquely identify a resource among all other resources of that type.

Computer systems generate UUIDs locally using very large random numbers.
In theory the IDs may not be globally unique, but the probability of duplicates is vanishingly small.
If systems really need absolutely unique IDs then these might be allocated by a central authority.

UUIDs are 128-bit values that are canonically represented as a 36-character string in the format `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000` (5 hex strings separated by hyphens).
There are a number of versions that differ slightly in the way they are calculated; for example, the inclusion of temporal information.

The formal definition can be found in: [RFC4122: A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122).

The system can be any kind of product or application that an end user is meant to interact with. UX studies undertaken on a web page for example can demonstrate whether it is easy for users to understand the page, navigate to different areas, and complete common tasks, and where such processes could have less friction.

## Term: Vendor Prefix

- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> Browser vendors sometimes add prefixes to experimental or nonstandard CSS properties and JavaScript APIs, so developers can experiment with new ideas while—in theory—preventing their experiments from being relied upon and then breaking web developers' code during the standardization process. Developers should wait to include the unprefixed property until browser behavior is standardized.

> **Note:** Browser vendors are working to stop using vendor prefixes for experimental features. Web developers have been using them on production Web sites, despite their experimental nature. This has made it more difficult for browser vendors to ensure compatibility and to work on new features; it's also been harmful to smaller browsers who wind up forced to add other browsers' prefixes in order to load popular web sites.
>
> Lately, the trend is to add experimental features behind user-controlled flags or preferences, and to create smaller specifications which can reach a stable state much more quickly.

## CSS prefixes

The major browsers use the following prefixes:

- `-webkit-` (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera, almost all iOS browsers including Firefox for iOS; basically, any WebKit based browser)
- `-moz-` (Firefox)
- `-o-` (old pre-WebKit versions of Opera)
- `-ms-` (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge)

Sample usage:

    -webkit-transition: all 4s ease;
    -moz-transition: all 4s ease;
    -ms-transition: all 4s ease;
    -o-transition: all 4s ease;
    transition: all 4s ease;

## API prefixes

Historically, vendors have also used prefixes for experimental APIs. If an entire interface is experimental, then the interface's name is prefixed (but not the properties or methods within). If an experimental property or method is added to a standardized interface, then the individual method or property is prefixed.

### Interface prefixes

Prefixes for interface names are upper-cased:

- `WebKit` (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera, almost all iOS browsers (including Firefox for iOS); basically, any WebKit based browser)
- `Moz` (Firefox)
- `O` (Older, pre-WebKit, versions of Opera)
- `MS` (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge)

### Property and method prefixes

The prefixes for properties and methods are lower-case:

- `webkit` (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera, almost all iOS browsers (including Firefox for iOS); basically, any WebKit based browser)
- `moz` (Firefox)
- `o` (Old, pre-WebKit, versions of Opera)
- `ms` (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge)

Sample usage:

```js
var requestAnimationFrame =
    window.requestAnimationFrame ||
    window.mozRequestAnimationFrame ||
    window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||
    window.oRequestAnimationFrame ||
    window.msRequestAnimationFrame;

Everything transferred through VoIP is digital. It is also known as IP telephony, or broadband telephony. The main reason for using VoIP technology is because of cost.

VoIP allows you to make a call directly from a computer, a special VoIP phone, or a traditional phone connected to a special adapter. A high speed internet connection is required for VoIP. Usually, telephone calls over the Internet do not incur further charges beyond what the user is paying for Internet access, much in the same way that the user doesn't pay for sending individual emails over the Internet.

WCAG 2.0 which superseded WCAG 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on 11 December 2008. It consists of 12 guidelines organized under 4 principles (perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust) and each guideline has testable success criteria.

WCAG uses three levels of conformance:

- Priority 1: Web developers **must** satisfy these requirements, otherwise it will be impossible for one or more groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as A.
- Priority 2: Web developers **should** satisfy these requirements, otherwise some groups will find it difficult to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AA or Double-A.
- Priority 3: Web developers **may** satisfy these requirements, in order to make it easier for some groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AAA or Triple-A.

Objectively, it is measurable time, in milliseconds, it takes for the web page or web application to be downloaded, painted in the user's web browser, and become responsive and interactive. It is the frames per second and times the main thread is not available for user interactions. Subjectively, it is the user's perception of whether the time it takes between the time the user requests the content and the time until the user feels the content requested is available and usable _feels_ slow or fast.

The system we know today as "the Web" consists of several components:

- The **_Glossary("HTTP"_)** protocol governs data transfer between a server and a client.
- To access a Web component, a client supplies a unique universal identifier, called a **_Glossary("URL"_)** (uniform resource locator) or _Glossary("URI"_) (uniform resource identifier) (formally called Universal Document Identifier (UDI)).
- **_Glossary("HTML"_)** (hypertext markup language) is the most common format for publishing web documents.

Linking, or connecting resources through _Glossary("Hyperlink","hyperlinks"_), is a defining concept of the Web, aiding its identity as a collection of connected documents.

Soon after inventing the Web, Tim Berners-Lee founded the _Glossary("W3C"_) (World Wide Web Consortium) to standardize and develop the Web further. This consortium consists of core Web interest groups, such as web browser developers, government entities, researchers, and universities. Its mission includes education and outreach.

## Term: Wrapper

- CodingScripting
- Glossary
- Wrapper

---

> In programming languages such as JavaScript, a wrapper is a function that is intended to call one or more other functions, sometimes purely for convenience, and sometimes adapting them to do a slightly different task in the process.

For example, SDK Libraries for AWS are examples of wrappers.

### Code sample

(Note that this has not been thoroughly tested for all circumstances and may not necessarily reflect the standard behavior completely.)

Note also that if you wish to allow xml:base, you will need the [xml:base function](/en-US/docs/Archive/Add-ons/Code_snippets/XML/base_function), and the line beginning `var href = ...` should become:

```js
var href = getXmlBaseLink(/* XLink sans xml:base */ xinclude.getAttribute('href'), /* Element to query from */ xinclude);
```

## Term: XLink

- CodingScripting
- Glossary

---

> XLink is a W3C standard which is used to describe links between XML and XML or other documents. Some its behaviors are left to the implementation to determine how to handle.

Simple XLinks are "supported" in Firefox (at least in SVG and MathML), though they do not work as links if one loads a plain XML document with XLinks and attempts to click on the relevant points in the XML tree.

For those who may have found XLink 1.0 cumbersome for regular links, XLink 1.1 drops the need to specify `xlink:type="simple"` for simple links.

XLink is used in [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML), and other important standards.
