## Text Version

### Plan Heading Structure Early

Ensure all content and design fits into a [logical heading structure](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/).

### Ensure Logical Reading Order

The [reading order for screen reader users](https://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/) should align with the visual order.

### Provide Good Contrast

Be especially careful with shades of orange, yellow, and light gray. Check your contrast levels with our [color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Use True Text Instead of Images of Text

[True text](https://webaim.org/techniques/images/text_graphic) enlarges better, loads faster, and is easier to translate and customize.

### Use Adequate Font Size

Small text is difficult for all users to see. Ensure text is optimally readable.

### Remember Line Length

Don’t make lines too long or too short.

### Make Sure Links are Recognizable

Distinguish [links](https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/) from body text using more than just color (e.g., underline).

### Design Keyboard Focus Indicators

When navigating with the keyboard, the focused item must be visually distinctive.

### Design a "Skip to Main Content" Link

A keyboard accessible [link for users to skip navigation](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/) should be at the top of the page.

### Ensure Link Text Makes Sense on Its Own

Avoid "Click Here" or other ambiguous [link text](https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/) such as "More" or "Continue".

### Design Usable Widgets and Controls

Dialogs, tooltips, menus, carousels, etc. must be easy to use and accessible.

### Use Animation, Video, and Audio Carefully

Provide play/pause buttons. Avoid distracting movement.

### Don’t Convey Content Using Only Color

Users may override or may not be able to see differences between colors.

### Design Accessible Form Controls

Ensure [form controls](https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/) have descriptive labels, instructions, and error messages.
