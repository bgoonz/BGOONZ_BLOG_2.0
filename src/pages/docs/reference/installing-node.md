## Android[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#android)

Android support is still experimental in Node.js, so precompiled binaries are not yet provided by Node.js developers.

However, there are some third-party solutions. For example, [Termux](https://termux.com/) community provides terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android, as well as own package manager and [extensive collection](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages) of many precompiled applications. This command in Termux app will install the last available Node.js version:

```
pkg install nodejs

```

Currently, Termux Node.js binaries are linked against `system-icu` (depending on `libicu` package).

## Arch Linux[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#arch-linux)

Node.js and npm packages are available in the Community Repository.

```
pacman -S nodejs npm

```

## CentOS, Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#centos-fedora-and-red-hat-enterprise-linux)

Node.js is available as a module called `nodejs` in CentOS/RHEL 8 and Fedora.

```
dnf module install nodejs:<stream>

```

where `<stream>` corresponds to the major version of Node.js. To see a list of available streams:

```
dnf module list nodejs

```

For example, to install Node.js 12:

```
dnf module install nodejs:12

```

For CentOS/RHEL 7 Node.js is available via [Software Collections](https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/?search=NodeJS).

## macOS[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos)

Download the [macOS Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/#home-downloadhead) directly from the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) web site.

_If you want to download the package with bash:_

```
curl "https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-${VERSION:-$(wget -qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/ | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\.pkg</a>.*|\1|p')}.pkg" > "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" && sudo installer -store -pkg "$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg" -target "/"

```

### Alternatives[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#alternatives-2)

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```
brew install node

```

Using [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/):

```
port install nodejs<major version>

# Example
port install nodejs7

```

Using [pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.joyent.com/install-on-osx/):

Install the binary package:

```
pkgin -y install nodejs

```

Or build manually from pkgsrc:

```
cd pkgsrc/lang/nodejs && bmake install

```

## n[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#n)

`n` is a simple to use Node.js version manager for Mac and Linux. Specify the target version to install using a rich syntax, or select from a menu of previously downloaded versions. The versions are installed system-wide or user-wide, and for more targeted use you can run a version directly from the cached downloads.

See the [homepage](https://github.com/tj/n) for install methods (boostrap, npm, Homebrew, third-party), and all the usage details.

If you already have `npm` then installing `n` and then the newest LTS `node` version is as simple as:

```
npm install -g n
n lts

```

## NetBSD[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#netbsd)

Node.js is available in the pkgsrc tree:

```
cd /usr/pkgsrc/lang/nodejs && make install

```

Or install a binary package (if available for your platform) using pkgin:

```
pkgin -y install nodejs

```

## Nodenv[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nodenv)

`nodenv` is a lightweight node version manager, similar to `nvm`. It's simple and predictable. A rich plugin ecosystem lets you tailor it to suit your needs. Use `nodenv` to pick a Node version for your application and guarantee that your development environment matches production.

Nodenv installation instructions are maintained [on its Github page](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv#installation). Please visit that page to ensure you're following the latest version of the installation steps.

## nvm[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm)

Node Version Manager is a bash script used to manage multiple released Node.js versions. It allows you to perform operations like install, uninstall, switch version, etc. To install nvm, use this [install script](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script).

On Unix / OS X systems Node.js built from source can be installed using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) by installing into the location that nvm expects:

```
env VERSION=`python tools/getnodeversion.py` make install DESTDIR=`nvm_version_path v$VERSION` PREFIX=""

```

After this you can use `nvm` to switch between released versions and versions built from source. For example, if the version of Node.js is v8.0.0-pre:

```
nvm use 8

```

Once the official release is out you will want to uninstall the version built from source:

```
nvm uninstall 8

```

## nvs[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvs)

#### Windows[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows)

The `nvs` version manager is cross-platform and can be used on Windows, macOS, and Unix-like systems

To install `nvs` on Windows go to the [release page](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/releases) here and download the MSI installer file of the latest release.

You can also use `chocolatey` to install it:

```
choco install nvs

```

#### macOS,UnixLike[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos-unixlike)

You can find the documentation regarding the installation steps of `nvs` in macOS/Unix-like systems [here](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md#mac-linux)

#### Usage[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#usage)

After this you can use `nvs` to switch between different versions of node.

To add the latest version of node:

```
nvs add latest

```

Or to add the latest LTS version of node:

```
nvs add lts

```

Then run the `nvs use` command to add a version of node to your `PATH` for the current shell:

```
$ nvs use lts
PATH -= %LOCALAPPDATA%\nvs\default
PATH += %LOCALAPPDATA%\nvs\node\14.17.0\x64

```

To add it to `PATH` permanently, use `nvs link`:

```
nvs link lts

```

## OpenBSD[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#openbsd)

Node.js is available through the ports system.

```
/usr/ports/lang/node

```

Using [pkg_add](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/pkg_add.1) on OpenBSD:

```
pkg_add node

```

## openSUSE and SLE[](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#opensuse-and-sle)

Node.js is available in the main repositories under the following packages:

-   openSUSE Leap 15.2: `nodejs10`, `nodejs12`, `nodejs14`
