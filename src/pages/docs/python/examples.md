### Here are the problems without solutions for you to practice with:

---

### Problem 1

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn `100` years old.

The `datetime` module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

While date and time arithmetic is supported, the focus of the implementation is on efficient attribute extraction for output formatting and manipulation.

</a>

### Problem 2

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is `even` or `odd`, print out an appropriate message to the user.

#### Bonus:

1.  <span id="eebc">If the number is a multiple of `4`, print out a different message.</span>
2.  <span id="306e">Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.</span>

### Problem 3

Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are `less` than `5`.

Extras:

1.  <span id="fe03">Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than `5` from this list in it and print out this new list.</span>
2.  <span id="186b">Write this in one line of Python.</span>
3.  <span id="9cd1">Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.</span>

### Problem 4

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don't know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.

For example, `13` is a divisor of `26` because `26 / 13` has no remainder.)

### Problem 5

Take two lists, and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are `common between the lists (without duplicates)`. Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

</a>

Bonus:

1.  <span id="e18a">Randomly generate two lists to test this.</span>
2.  <span id="148a">Write this in one line of Python.</span>

### Problem 6

Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a `palindrome` or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

> Here's 5 ways to reverse a string (courtesy of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-string-python-5-different-ways/" class="markup--anchor markup--pullquote-anchor">geeksforgeeks</a>)

### Problem 7

Let's say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]`.

Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the `even` elements of this list in it.

### Problem 8

Make a two-player `Rock-Paper-Scissors` game.

**Hint:**  
Ask for player plays (using input), compare them. Print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game.

</figure>### Problem 9

Generate a random number between `1 and 100 (including 1 and 100)`. Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed `too low`, `too high`, or `exactly right`.

> **Hint:**  
> Remember to use the user input from the very first exercise.

**Extras:**  
Keep the game going until the user types `"exit"`.  
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.

### Problem 10

Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.

**Hint:**  
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …`

### Problem 11

In linear algebra, _a Toeplitz matrix is one in which the elements on any given diagonal from top left to bottom right are identical._  
Here is an example:

    1 2 3 4 8
    5 1 2 3 4
    4 5 1 2 3
    7 4 5 1 2

Write a program to determine whether a given input is a `Toeplitz` matrix.

### Problem 12

Given a positive integer `N`, find the smallest number of steps it will take to reach `1`.

There are two kinds of permitted steps:  
 — -&gt; You may decrement N to N — 1.  
 — -&gt; If `a * b = N`, you may decrement `N to the larger of a and b`.

For example, given 100, you can reach 1 in 5 steps with the following route:  
`100 -> 10 -> 9 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.`

### Problem 13

Consider the following scenario: there are `N` mice and `N` holes placed at integer points along a line. Given this, find a method that maps mice to holes such that the largest number of steps any mouse takes is minimized.

Each move consists of moving one mouse `one` unit to the `left` or `right`, and only `one` mouse can fit inside each hole.

For example, suppose the mice are positioned at `[1, 4, 9, 15]`, and the holes are located at `[10, -5, 0, 16]`. In this case, the best pairing would require us to send the mouse at `1` to the hole at `-5`, so our function should return `6`.

# Python

-   Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose, dynamically typed programming language
-
-   It is also Object oriented, modular oriented and a
-
-   In Python, everything is considered as an Object.
-
-   A python file has an extension of .py

-   Python follows Indentation to separate code blocks instead of flower brackets({}).

-   We can run a python file by the following command in cmd(Windows) or shell(mac/linux).

    `python <filename.py>`

#### By default, the python doesn't require any imports to run a python file.

## Create and execute a program

1. Open up a terminal/cmd
1. Create the program: nano/cat > nameProgram.py
1. Write the program and save it
1. python nameProgram.py

### Basic Data Structures

### List

-   List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
-
-   Lists are created using square brackets:

```py
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

-   List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
-
-   List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.
-
-   The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

-   To determine how many items a list has, use the `len()` function.

-   A list can contain different data types:

```py
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
```

-   It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list

```py
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # note the double round-brackets
```

### Tuple

-   Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
-   A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
-   Tuples are written with round brackets.

```py
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

-   Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
-   Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.
-   When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
-
-   Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remo
-   Since tuple are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value:
-   Tuples allow duplicate values:

```py
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
```

-   To determine how many items a tuple has, use the `len()`function:

```py
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))
```

-   To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.

```py
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))
```

-   It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.

```py

thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thistuple)
```

### Set

-   Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
-   A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

```py
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

-   Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
-   Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
-
-   Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to b
-
-   Sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
-   Duplicate values will be ignored.
-   To determine how many items a set has, use the `len()` method.

```py
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print(len(thisset))
```

-   Set items can be of any data type:

```py
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
set3 = {True, False, False}
set4 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}
```

-   It is also possible to use the `set()` constructor to make a set.

```py
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
```

### Dictionary

-   Dictionary is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.
-   Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
-   Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

```py
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
```

-   Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

```py
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])
```

-   Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
-   Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.
-   Duplicate values will overwrite existing values.
-   To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the `len()` function.

```py
print(len(thisdict))
```

-   The values in dictionary items can be of any data type

```py
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}
```

### Conditional branching

```py
    if condition:
        pass
    elif condition2:
        pass
    else:
        pass
```

### Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

1. while loops
2. for loops

#### While loop

-   With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
-   Example: Print i as long as i is less than 6

```py
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

-   The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
-   With the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
-   With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.
-
-   With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.

#### For loop

-   A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
-
-   This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

-   With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

```py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
```

-   The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
-   To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function.
-   The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
-   The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3).
-   The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished.
    A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

-   The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

```py
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
```

-   for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.

```py
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
```

### Function definition

```py
def function_name():
    return
```

### Function call

```py
function_name()
```

-   We need not to specify the return type of the function.
-   Functions by default return `None`
-   We can return any datatype.

```py

def say_hi(name):
    """<---- Multi-Line Comments and Docstrings
    This is where you put your content for help() to inform the user
    about what your function does and how to use it

    print(f"Hello {name}!")

print(say_hi("Bryan"))  # Should get the print inside the function, then None
# Boolean Values
# Work the same as in JS, except they are title case: True and False
a = True
b = False
# Logical Operators
# ! = not, || = or, && = and
print(True and True)
print(True and not True)
print(True or True)
# Truthiness - Everything is True except...
# False - None, False, '', [], (), set(), range(0)
# Number Values
# Integers are numbers without a floating decimal point
print(type(3))  # type returns the type of whatever argument you pass in
# Floating Point values are numbers with a floating decimal point

# Type Casting
# You can convert between ints and floats (along with other types...)
print(float(3))  # If you convert a float to an int, it will truncate the decimal
print(int(4.5))

#  math
#  |  __init__.py
