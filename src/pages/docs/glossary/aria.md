# **ARIA** (_Accessible Rich Internet"Applications_) is a W3C"specification for adding semantics and other metadata to HTML"to cater to users of assistive technology

For example, you could add the attribute `role="alert"` to a {{HTMLElement("p"tag"to notify a sight-challenged user that the information is important and time-sensitive (which you might otherwise convey through text color).
