# An **accent** is a typically bright color that contrasts with the more utilitarian background and foreground colors within a color scheme. These are present in the visual style of many platforms (though not all).

On the web, an accent is sometimes used in {{HTMLElement("input"elements for the active portion of the control, for instance the background of a checked [checkbox](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox).
