**Getting Started with React - EOD Lecture Notes**

![](w14-study-guide_files/image001.jpg)



**Explain how React uses a tree data structure called the "virtual DOM" to model the DOM**



The Virtual DOM is an in-memory tree representation of the browser's Document



Object Model. React's philosophy is to interact with the Virtual DOM instead



of the regular DOM for developer ease and performance.



By abstracting the key concepts from the DOM, React is able to expose additional



tooling and functionality increasing developer ease.



By trading off the additional memory requirements of the Virtual DOM, React is



able to optimize for efficient subtree comparisons, resulting in fewer, simpler



updates to the less efficient DOM. The result of these tradeoffs is improved



performance.



Supporting performant Virtual DOM comparisons informs a key aspect of the React



philosophy:

![](w14-study-guide_files/image006.jpg)



In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment,



rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.



**Use React.createElement to create virtual DOM nodes**



Every Virtual DOM Node is eventually constructed using the React.createElement





function.



createElement accepts three arguments, which represent the three key components of every Virtual DOM Node, it's type , it's props , and it's children (i.e. it's contents).

![](w14-study-guide_files/image007.jpg)





React.createElement(



type, *// Either an html element "h1", \_or\_ a React Component \`Component\`*

[]()

props, *// These are \_static\_ properties && any html attributes*

![](w14-study-guide_files/image008.jpg)



children *// An array of Virtual DOM Nodes, or a string of content*



);





**Use ReactDOM.render to have React render your virtual DOM nodes into the actual Web page**



ReactDOM.render is a simple function which accepts 2 arguments: what to render and where to render it:

![](w14-study-guide_files/image009.jpg)





ReactDOM.render(



component, *// The react component to render*



target *// the browser DOM node to render it to*



);





**Use JSX to create virtual DOM nodes**



**Describe how JSX transforms into React.createElement calls**



JSX is a special format to let you construct virtual DOM nodes using familiar



HTML-like syntax. You can put the JSX directly into your .js files, however





you must run the JSX through a pre-compiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)



in order for the browser to understand it.

![](w14-study-guide_files/image010.jpg)





**const** Clock = (props) => {



**return** (



<div>



<h1>Clock</h1>



<div className='clock'>



<p>



<span>



Time:



</span>



<span>



{props.hours}:{props.minutes}:{props.seconds}



</span>



</p>



</div>



</div>



);



}





Here we initialize a Clock component using JSX instead of React.createElement .





Using [Babel ](https://babeljs.io/)this code is compiled to a series of recursively nested createElement calls:

**const** Clock = (props) => {



**return** (



<div>



<h1>Clock</h1>



<div className='clock'>



<p>



<span>



Time:



</span>



<span>



{props.hours}:{props.minutes}:{props.seconds}



</span>



</p>



</div>



</div>



);



}





Here we initialize a Clock component using JSX instead of React.createElement .





Using [Babel ](https://babeljs.io/)this code is compiled to a series of recursively nested createElement calls:

![A picture containing graphical user interface

**const** Clock = (props) => {



**return** React.createElement(



"div",



null,



[



React.createElement("h1", null, "Clock"),



React.createElement("div", {className: "clock"}, [



React.createElement("p", null, [



React.createElement("span", null, "Time:"),



React.createElement("span", props, "{props.hours}:{props.minutes}:{props.seconds}")



])



])



]



);



}





JSX is a convenience syntax, but not magic.



**Use Array#map to create an array of virtual DOM nodes while specifying a unique key for each created virtual DOM node**



Since [Array.prototype.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)



is often used to change an array of values into another array of values of



equal length, it's a perfect way to convert an array of *data* or *state* into



a list of React Components.



There's one *gotcha* when doing this, though. In order for React to keep track



of which components in the list it's rendered and which ones it needs to



re-render when the data changes, you **MUST** provide a **unique** key





attribute to the rendered Components.

**React Class Components Objectives**

![](w14-study-guide_files/image001.jpg)



**Create a simple React application by removing items and content from a project generated by the Create React App default template**



To generate a React project

![](w14-study-guide_files/image014.jpg)





npx create-react-app my-app-name





**Files you can delete**



Remove the following files from the public folder:



favicon.ico

![](w14-study-guide_files/image002.jpg)



robots.txt

![](w14-study-guide_files/image015.jpg)



logo192.png

![](w14-study-guide_files/image015.jpg)



logo512.png

![](w14-study-guide_files/image002.jpg)



manifest.json

![](w14-study-guide_files/image002.jpg)



You can replace all the content of index.html with the boilerplate HTML generated by the html:5 command. Don't forget to add a div inside body with an id of "root".



Remove the following files from the src folder:



App.css

![](w14-study-guide_files/image015.jpg)



App.test.js

![](w14-study-guide_files/image002.jpg)

**Create a simple React application using a custom Create React App template**



To use aA's custom template:

**Create a React component using ES2015 class syntax**

![A picture containing shape

**import** React **from** 'react'



**class Hello extends React**.**Component** {



**constructor**() {



**super**();



**this**.state = {



name: **this**.pickRandomName()



}



}



pickRandomName() {



**const** randomNum =Math.floor(Math.random() \*3);



**const** names = ['LeBron','Messi','Serena']



**return** names\[randomNum];



}



changeName = () => {



**this**.setState({

});



}



render() {

<>



<h1>Hello {this.state.name}!</h1>



<button onClick={this.changeName}>Change name</button>



</>



)



}



}



**export default** Hello;





**Describe when it's appropriate to use a class component**



Since the release of React Hooks (which we will learn about next week) any



advantages for class based components have evaporated, so this Learning

Objective does not make a lot of sense anymore and you can safely ignore it.



**Initialize and update state within a class component**



Initialize the state inside the component's constructor:

![](w14-study-guide_files/image017.jpg)





**this**.state = {



name: '',



email: '',



password: ''



}





The update can happen inside any instance method except for render():

![](w14-study-guide_files/image017.jpg)





handleEmail = (e) => {



**this**.setState({



email: e.target.value



});



}





**Provide default values for a class component's props**

{book.title} by {book.author}



</li>



);



})}



</ul>



)



}



}



Books.defaultProps = {



books: [



{title: "Don Quixote", author: "Miguel De Cervantes"},



{title: "Pedro Paramo", author: "Juan Rulfo"}



]



};



**export default** Books;





**Add event listeners to elements**

render() {



**return** (



<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>



<input type="text" value={this.state.value}/>



<button>Submit!</button>



</form>



)



}





**Prevent event default behavior**

![A picture containing shape

Description automatically generated](w14-study-guide_files/image020.jpg)





handleSubmit = e => {



e.preventDefault();



**const** inputVal = **this**.state.value;



//                     *this.props.submitForm is an example of a method passed*

//                     *as part of the props. It is not a built-in method.*

//                     *The software engineer writing this code would need to write it.*

//                     *Tipically the method will take the response and attach*

//                     *it to the body of an AJAX request*



**this**.props.submitForm(inputVal);



}





**Safely use the this keyword within event handlers**



We can use the experimental syntax that consist of using a fat arrow function:

![](w14-study-guide_files/image017.jpg)





changeEmail = e => {



**this**.setState({



email: e.target.value



});



}

**Describe what the React SyntheticEvent object is and the role it plays in handling events**



The SyntheticEvent object mimics the characteristics of the event passed to the callback in an event handler but adding more data to it.



These are two common uses:

e.preventDefault();



e.stopPropagation();
