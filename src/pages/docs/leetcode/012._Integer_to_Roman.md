## [12. Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/description/)

### Problem:

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 3
Output: "III"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "IV"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 9
Output: "IX"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: C = 100, L = 50, XXX = 30 and III = 3.
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

### Solution:

Treat 4, 40, 400 and 9, 90, 900 specially.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {string}
 */
let intToRoman = function (num) {
  const e = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1];
  const s = [
    "M",
    "CM",
    "D",
    "CD",
    "C",
    "XC",
    "L",
    "XL",
    "X",
    "IX",
    "V",
    "IV",
    "I",
  ];

  let result = "";
  for (let i = 0; num; i++) {
    const d = e[i];
    const v = s[i];
    while (num >= d) {
      num -= d;
      result += v;
    }
  }
  return result;
};
```
