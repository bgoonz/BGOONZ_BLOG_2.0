## Installation ⚒️

Automate time-consuming or repetitive tasks in your development workflow using Gulp 🥤

Installing Node & Gulp and running it is super easy in Sneat, please follow these steps and you should be ready to rock 🤘

1. First of all, make sure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS). If Node.js is already installed in your system, make sure the installed version is `LTS` and jump to step 2
2. Install the Gulp CLI: Open Terminal/Command Prompt and run the following command and wait until it finishes. If you have already installed Gulp CLI, you can skip this step and jump to step 3.

```

```

3. Navigate to the Sneat root directory and run following command to install our local dependencies listed in `package.json`. You can use `npm` OR `yarn` as per your preference.
