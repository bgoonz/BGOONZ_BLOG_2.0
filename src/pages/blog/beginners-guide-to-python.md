### The Repository & Live Site Behind This Article:

### About Python(Taken From Tutorial Page Of Docs):

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</a>

-   <span id="894d">the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</span>
-   <span id="48ef">statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</span>
-   <span id="f361">no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</span>

### Installing Python:

### Windows

To determine if your Windows computer already has Python 3:

1.  <span id="4838">Open a command prompt by entering command prompt in the Windows 10 search box and selecting the Command Prompt App in the Best match section of the results.</span>
2.  <span id="f6bc">Enter the following command and then select the Enter key:</span>
3.  <span id="24ec">ConsoleCopy</span>

`python --version`

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*59V2ZNbyJfsdGR2N20PM7w.png" class="graf-image" />
</figure>1.  <span id="e87f">Running `python --version` may not return a value, or may return an error message stating *'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.* This indicates Python is not installed on your Windows system.</span>
2.  <span id="7c04">If you see the word `Python` with a set of numbers separated by `.` characters, some version of Python is installed.</span>

#### i.e.

> `Python 3.8.0`

**As long as the first number is** `3`, you have Python 3 installed.

### Python

-   <span id="c462">Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose, dynamically typed programming language</span>
-   <span id="74e1">It is also Object oriented, modular oriented and a scripting language.</span>
-   <span id="6e0e">In Python, everything is considered as an Object.</span>
-   <span id="490d">A python file has an extension of .py</span>
-   <span id="2bd5">Python follows Indentation to separate code blocks instead of flower brackets({}).</span>
-   <span id="6434">We can run a python file by the following command in cmd(Windows) or shell(mac/linux).</span>
-   <span id="b76b">`python <filename.py>`</span>

#### By default, the python doesn't require any imports to run a python file.

### Create and execute a program

1.  <span id="d7b7">Open up a terminal/cmd</span>
2.  <span id="a7a7">Create the program: nano/cat &gt; <a href="http://nameprogram.py/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">nameProgram.py</a>
    </span>
3.  <span id="aace">Write the program and save it</span>
4.  <span id="b439">python <a href="http://nameprogram.py/" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor">nameProgram.py</a>

</figure>### Basic Data Structures

### List

-   <span id="a311">List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.</span>
-   <span id="cd75">Lists are created using square brackets:</span>

<!-- -->

    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

-   <span id="8afd">List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.</span>
-   <span id="668d">List items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.</span>
-   <span id="b8c7">The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.</span>
-   <span id="b5f4">To determine how many items a list has, use the `len()` function.</span>
-   <span id="7dff">A list can contain different data types:</span>

<!-- -->

    list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

-   <span id="9e81">It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list</span>

<!-- -->

    thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # note the double round-brackets

### Tuple

-   <span id="50ea">Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.</span>
-   <span id="14ac">A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.</span>
-   <span id="8cde">Tuples are written with round brackets.</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

-   <span id="3e58">Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.</span>
-   <span id="2f5a">Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index `[0]`, the second item has index `[1]` etc.</span>
-   <span id="6f87">When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.</span>
-   <span id="709a">Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.</span>
-   <span id="134b">Since tuple are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value:</span>
-   <span id="2720">Tuples allow duplicate values:</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")

-   <span id="ddae">To determine how many items a tuple has, use the `len()`function:</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    print(len(thistuple))

-   <span id="2723">To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = ("apple",)
    print(type(thistuple))

    #NOT a tuple
    thistuple = ("apple")
    print(type(thistuple))

-   <span id="4556">It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.</span>

<!-- -->

    thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
    print(thistuple)

### Set

-   <span id="1991">Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.</span>
-   <span id="d108">A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.</span>

<!-- -->

    thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

-   <span id="4098">Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.</span>
-   <span id="b4d0">Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.</span>
-   <span id="d081">Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.</span>
-   <span id="4f53">Sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.</span>
-   <span id="812b">Duplicate values will be ignored.</span>
-   <span id="3ac9">To determine how many items a set has, use the `len()` method.</span>

<!-- -->

    thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

    print(len(thisset))

-   <span id="b34e">Set items can be of any data type:</span>

<!-- -->

    set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
    set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
    set3 = {True, False, False}
    set4 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}

-   <span id="2a23">It is also possible to use the `set()` constructor to make a set.</span>

<!-- -->

    thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets

### Dictionary

-   <span id="3c14">Dictionary is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.</span>
-   <span id="cf8a">Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.</span>
-   <span id="bbb2">Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:</span>

<!-- -->

    thisdict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Mustang",
      "year": 1964
    }

-   <span id="7f11">Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.</span>

<!-- -->

    thisdict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Mustang",
      "year": 1964
    }
    print(thisdict["brand"])

-   <span id="8700">Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.</span>
-   <span id="ea7e">Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key.</span>
-   <span id="1ad4">Duplicate values will overwrite existing values.</span>
-   <span id="7582">To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the `len()` function.</span>

<!-- -->

    print(len(thisdict))

-   <span id="305d">The values in dictionary items can be of any data type</span>

<!-- -->

    thisdict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "electric": False,
      "year": 1964,
      "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
    }

### Conditional branching

    if condition:
            pass
        elif condition2:
            pass
        else:
            pass

### Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

1.  <span id="cd2b">while loops</span>
2.  <span id="f858">for loops</span>

#### While loop

-   <span id="e9e1">With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</span>
-   <span id="ef71">Example: Print i as long as i is less than 6</span>

<!-- -->

    i = 1
    while i < 6:
      print(i)
      i += 1

-   <span id="5f4a">The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.</span>
-   <span id="2dce">With the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true</span>
-   <span id="371e">With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next.</span>
-   <span id="3dcf">With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true.</span>

#### For loop

-   <span id="0fa5">A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</span>
-   <span id="871e">This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</span>
-   <span id="ca9c">With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</span>

<!-- -->

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    for x in fruits:
      print(x)

-   <span id="19c1">The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.</span>
-   <span id="fb47">To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function.</span>
-   <span id="f32d">The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.</span>
-   <span id="b8d4">The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3).</span>
-   <span id="cca5">The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished.
    A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.</span>
-   <span id="acbb">The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":</span>

<!-- -->

    adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

    for x in adj:
      for y in fruits:
        print(x, y)

-   <span id="1bdd">for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.</span>

<!-- -->

    for x in [0, 1, 2]:
      pass

### Function definition

    def function_name():
        return

### Function call

    function_name()

-   <span id="a1ca">We need not to specify the return type of the function.</span>
-   <span id="89e4">Functions by default return `None`</span>
-   <span id="7041">We can return any datatype.</span>

---

### Python Syntax

Python syntax was made for readability, and easy editing. For example, the python language uses a `:` and indented code, while javascript and others generally use `{}` and indented code.

### First Program

Lets create a <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">python 3</a> repl, and call it _Hello World_. Now you have a blank file called _main.py_. Now let us write our first line of code:

    print('Hello world!')

> _Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first "Hello, World!" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards._

Now, press the run button, which obviously runs the code. If you are not using replit, this will not work. You should research how to run a file with your text editor.

### Command Line

If you look to your left at the console where hello world was just printed, you can see a `>`, `>>>`, or `$` depending on what you are using. After the prompt, try typing a line of code.

    Python 3.6.1 (default, Jun 21 2017, 18:48:35)
    [GCC 4.9.2] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    > print('Testing command line')
    Testing command line
    > print('Are you sure this works?')
    Are you sure this works?
    >

The command line allows you to execute single lines of code at a time. It is often used when trying out a new function or method in the language.

### New: Comments!

Another cool thing that you can generally do with all languages, are comments. In python, a comment starts with a `#`. The computer ignores all text starting after the `#`.

`# Write some comments!`

If you have a huge comment, do **not** comment all the 350 lines, just put `'''` before it, and `'''` at the end. Technically, this is not a comment but a string, but the computer still ignores it, so we will use it.

### New: Variables!

Unlike many other languages, there is no `var`, `let`, or `const` to declare a variable in python. You simply go `name = 'value'`.

Remember, there is a difference between integers and strings. _Remember: String =_ `""`_._ To convert between these two, you can put an int in a `str()` function, and a string in a `int()` function. There is also a less used one, called a float. Mainly, these are integers with decimals. Change them using the `float()` command.

<a href="https://repl.it/@bgoonz/second-scr?lite=true&amp;amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbryanguner.medium.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">https://repl.it/@bgoonz/second-scr?lite=true&amp;amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2F

    x = 5
    x = str(x)
    b = '5'
    b = int(b)
    print('x = ', x, '; b = ', str(b), ';') # => x = 5; b = 5;

Instead of using the `,` in the print function, you can put a `+` to combine the variables and string.

### Operators

There are many operators in python:

-   <span id="d553">`+`</span>
-   <span id="a1b3">`-`</span>
-   <span id="f09c">`/`</span>
-   <span id="cd1e">`*`
    These operators are the same in most languages, and allow for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplicaiton.
    Now, we can look at a few more complicated ones:</span>

<figure>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oVIDxWdgJXoIt7CI.jpg" class="graf-image" />
</figure>*simpleops.py*

    x = 4
    a = x + 1
    a = x - 1
    a = x * 2
    a = x / 2

You should already know everything shown above, as it is similar to other languages. If you continue down, you will see more complicated ones.

_complexop.py_

    a += 1
    a -= 1
    a *= 2
    a /= 2

The ones above are to edit the current value of the variable.
Sorry to JS users, as there is no `i++;` or anything.

### Fun Fact: The python language was named after Monty Python.

If you really want to know about the others, view <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Py Operators</a>

### More Things With Strings

Like the title?
Anyways, a `'` and a `"` both indicate a string, but **do not combine them!**

_quotes.py_

    x = 'hello' # Good
    x = "hello" # Good
    x = "hello' # ERRORRR!!!

_slicing.py_

### String Slicing

You can look at only certain parts of the string by slicing it, using `[num:num]`.
The first number stands for how far in you go from the front, and the second stands for how far in you go from the back.

    x = 'Hello everybody!'
    x[1] # 'e'
    x[-1] # '!'
    x[5] # ' '
    x[1:] # 'ello everybody!'
    x[:-1] # 'Hello everybod'
    x[2:-3] # 'llo everyb'

### Methods and Functions

Here is a list of functions/methods we will go over:

-   <span id="aaaa">`.strip()`</span>
-   <span id="b3ee">`len()`</span>
-   <span id="c5cc">`.lower()`</span>
-   <span id="3466">`.upper()`</span>
-   <span id="a06d">`.replace()`</span>
-   <span id="57b6">`.split()`</span>

</a>

### New: Input()

Input is a function that gathers input entered from the user in the command line. It takes one optional parameter, which is the users prompt.

_inp.py_

    print('Type something: ')
    x = input()
    print('Here is what you said: ', x)

If you wanted to make it smaller, and look neater to the user, you could doâ€¦

_inp2.py_

    print('Here is what you said: ', input('Type something: '))

Running:
_inp.py_

    Type something:
    Hello World
    Here is what you said: Hello World

_inp2.py_

    Type something: Hello World
    Here is what you said: Hello World

### New: Importing Modules

Python has created a lot of functions that are located in other .py files. You need to import these **modules** to gain access to the,, You may wonder why python did this. The purpose of separate modules is to make python faster. Instead of storing millions and millions of functions, , it only needs a few basic ones. To import a module, you must write `input <modulename>`. Do not add the .py extension to the file name. In this example , we will be using a python created module named random.

_module.py_

    import random

Now, I have access to all functions in the random.py file. To access a specific function in the module, you would do `<module>.<function>`. For example:

_module2.py_

    import random
    print(random.randint(3,5)) # Prints a random number between 3 and 5

> _Pro Tip:
> Do_ `from random import randint` _to not have to do_ `random.randint()`_, just_ `randint()`_
> To import all functions from a module, you could do_ `from random import *`

### New: Loops!

Loops allow you to repeat code over and over again. This is useful if you want to print Hi with a delay of one second 100 times.

#### `for` Loop

The for loop goes through a list of variables, making a seperate variable equal one of the list every time.
Let's say we wanted to create the example above.

_loop.py_

    from time import sleep
    for i in range(100):
         print('Hello')
         sleep(.3)

This will print Hello with a .3 second delay 100 times. This is just one way to use it, but it is usually used like this:

_loop2.py_

    import time
    for number in range(100):
         print(number)
         time.sleep(.1)

#### `while` Loop

The while loop runs the code while something stays true. You would put `while <expression>`. Every time the loop runs, it evaluates if the expression is True. It it is, it runs the code, if not it continues outside of the loop. For example:

_while.py_

    while True: # Runs forever
         print('Hello World!')

Or you could do:

_while2.py_

    import random
    position = '<placeholder>'
    while position != 1: # will run at least once
        position = random.randint(1, 10)
        print(position)

### New: `if` Statement

The if statement allows you to check if something is True. If so, it runs the code, if not, it continues on. It is kind of like a while loop, but it executes **only once**. An if statement is written:

_if.py_

    import random
    num = random.randint(1, 10)
    if num == 3:
         print('num is 3. Hooray!!!')
    if num > 5:
         print('Num is greater than 5')
    if num == 12:
         print('Num is 12, which means that there is a problem with the python language, see if you can figure it out. Extra credit if you can figure it out!')

Now, you may think that it would be better if you could make it print only one message. Not as many that are True. You can do that with an `elif` statement:

_elif.py_

    import random
    num = random.randint(1, 10)
    if num == 3:
        print('Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.')
    elif num > 2:
        print('Num is not three, but is greater than 1')

Now, you may wonder how to run code if none work. Well, there is a simple statement called `else:`

_else.py_

    import random
    num = random.randint(1, 10)
    if num == 3:
        print('Num is three, this is the only msg you will see.')
    elif num > 2:
        print('Num is not three, but is greater than 1')
    else:
        print('No category')

### New: Functions (`def`)

So far, you have only seen how to use functions other people have made. Let use the example that you want to print the a random number between 1 and 9, and print different text every time.
It is quite tiring to type:

Characters: 389

_nofunc.py_

    import random
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('Wow that was interesting.')
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('Look at the number above ^')
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('All of these have been interesting numbers.')
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print("these random.randint's are getting annoying to type")
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('Hi')
    print(random.randint(1, 9))
    print('j')

Now with functions, you can seriously lower the amount of characters:

Characters: 254

_functions.py_

    import random
    def r(t):
         print(random.randint(1, 9))
         print(t)
    r('Wow that was interesting.')
    r('Look at the number above ^')
    r('All of these have been interesting numbers.')
    r("these random.randint's are getting annoying to type")
    r('Hi')
    r('j')

### Project Based Learning:

The following is a modified version of a tutorial posted By: <a href="https://replit.com/@InvisibleOne" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">InvisibleOne</a>

I would cite the original tutorial it's self but at the time of this writing I can no longer find it on his repl.it profile and so the only reference I have are my own notes from following the tutorial when I first found it.

### 1. Adventure Story

The first thing you need with an adventure story is a great storyline, something that is exciting and fun. The idea is, that at each pivotal point in the story, you give the player the opportunity to make a choice.
First things first, let's import the stuff that we need, like this:

    import os   #very useful for clearing the screen
    import random

Now, we need some variables to hold some of the player data.

    name = input("Name Please:  ") #We'll use this to get the name from the user
    nickname = input("Nickname: ")

Ok, now we have the player's name and nickname, let's welcome them to the game

    print("Hello and welcome " + name)

Now for the story. The most important part of all stories is the introduction, so let's print our introduction

    print("Long ago, there was a magical meal known as Summuh and Spich Atip") #We can drop a line by making a new print statement, or we can use the escape code \n
    print("It was said that this meal had the power to save lives, restore peace, and stop evil\nBecuase it was so powerful, it was hidden away on a mountain that could not be climbed\nBut it's power brought unwanted attention, and a great war broke out.\nFinally, the leaders of the good side chose a single hero to go and find the Summah and Spich Atip, that hero was " + name + "\n so " + nickname + ' headed out to find this great power, and stop the warâ€¦')

Now, we'll give the player their first choice

    print("After hiking through the wastelands for a long time, you come to a massive ravine, there is only a single way across\nA rickety old bridge, taking that could be very dangerous, butâ€¦ maybe you could jump across?")
    choice1 = input("[1]  Take the bridge     [2] Try and jump over")
    #Now we check to see what the player chose
    If choice1 == '1':
      print("You slowly walk across the bride, it creakes ominously, then suddenly breaks! You flail through the air before hitting the ground a thousand feet below. Judging by the fact that you hit the ground with the equivalent force of being hit by a cement truck moving at 125 miles an hour, you are deadâ€¦")
      #The player lost, so now we'll boot them out of the program with the exit command
      exit()
    #Then we check to see if they made the other choice, we can do with with else if, written as elif
    elif choice1 == '2':
      print("You make the jump! You see a feather hit the bridge, the weight breakes it and sends it to the bottom of the ravine\nGood thing you didn't use that bridge.")
    #Now we can continue the story
    print("A few more hours of travel and you come to the unclimbable mountain.")
    choice2 == input("[1]   Give up    [2]    Try and climb the mountain")
    if choice2 == '1':
      print("You gave up and lostâ€¦")
      #now we exit them again
      exit()
    elif choice2 == '1':
      print("you continue up the mountain. Climbing is hard, but finally you reach the top.\nTo your surprise there is a man standing at the top of the mountain, he is very old.")
      print("Old Man: Hey " + nickname)
      print("You: How do you know my name!?!")
      print("Old Man: Because you have a name tag onâ€¦")
      print("You: Oh, well, were is the Summuh and Spich Atip?")
      print("Old Man: Summuh and Spich Atip? You must mean the Pita Chips and Hummus")
      print("You: Pitaâ€¦chipsâ€¦humus, what power do those have?")
      print("Old Man: Pretty simple kid, their organicâ€¦")
      #Now let's clear the screen
      os.system('clear')
      print("YOU WON!!!")

There you have it, a pretty simple choose your own ending story. You can make it as complex or uncomplex as you like.

### 2. TEXT ENCODER

Ever make secret messages as a kid? I used to. Anyways, here's the way you can make a program to encode messages! It's pretty simple. First things first, let's get the message the user wants to encode, we'll use input() for that:

    message = input("Message you would like encoded: ")

Now we need to split that string into a list of characters, this part is a bit more complicated.

    #We'll make a function, so we can use it later
    def split(x):
      return (char for char in x)
    #now we'll call this function with our text
    L_message = message.lower() #This way we can lower any of their input
    encode = split(l_message)

Now we need to convert the characters into code, well do this with a for loop:

    out = []
    for x in encode:
      if x == 'a':
        out.append('1')
      elif x == 'b':
        out.append('2')
    #And we'll continue on though this with each letter of the alphabet

Once we've encoded the text, we'll print it back for the user

    x = ' '.join(out)
    #this will turn out into a string that we can print
    print(x)

And if you want to decode something, it is this same process but in reverse!

### 3. Guess my Number

Number guessing games are fun and pretty simple, all you need are a few loops. To start, we need to import random.

    import random

That is pretty simple. Now we'll make a list with the numbers were want available for the game

    num_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Next, we get a random number from the list

    num = random.choice(num_list)

Now, we need to ask the user for input, we'll to this with a while loop

    while True:
      # We could use guess = input("What do you think my number is?   "), but that would produce a string, and numbers are integers, so we'll convert the input into an integer
      guess = int(input("What do you think my number is?   "))
      #Next, we'll check if that number is equal to the number we picked
      if guess == num:
        break   #this will remove us from the loop, so we can display the win message
      else:
        print("Nope, that isn't it")
    #outside our loop, we'll have the win message that is displayed if the player gets the correct number.
    print("You won!")

Have fun with this!

### 4. Notes

Here is a more advanced project, but still pretty easy. This will be using a txt file to save some notes. The first thing we need to do is to create a txt file in your repl, name it 'notes.txt'
Now, to open a file in python we use open('filename', type) The type can be 'r' for read, or 'w' for write. There is another option, but we won't be using that here. Now, the first thing we are going to do is get what the user would like to save:

    message = input("What would you like to save?")

Now we'll open our file and save that text

    o = open('notes.txt', 'w')
    o.write(message)
    #this next part is very important, you need to always remember to close your file or what you wrote to it won't be saved
    o.close()

There we go, now the information is in the file. Next, we'll retrieve it

    read = open('notes.txt', 'r')
    out = read.read()
    # now we need to close the file
    read.close()
    # and now print what we read
    print(out)

There we go, that's how you can open files and close files with python

### 5. Random Dare Generator

Who doesn't love a good dare? Here is a program that can generate random dares. The first thing we'll need to do is as always, import random. Then we'll make some lists of dares

    import random
    list1 = ['jump on', 'sit on', 'rick roll on', 'stop on', 'swing on']
    list2 = ['your cat', 'your neighbor', 'a dog', 'a tree', 'a house']
    list3 = ['your mom', 'your best friend', 'your dad', 'your teacher']
    #now we'll generate a dare
    while True:
      if input() == '': #this will trigger if they hit enter
        print("I dare you to " + random.choice(list1) + ' ' + random.choice(list2) + ' in front of '  + random.choice(list3)
