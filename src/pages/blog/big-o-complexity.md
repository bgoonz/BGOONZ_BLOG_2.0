### Bubble Sort

Time Complexity: Quadratic O(n^2)

- The inner for-loop contributes to O(n), however in a worst case scenario the while loop will need to run n times before bringing all n elements to their final resting spot.

Space Complexity: O(1)

- Bubble Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/e67e56bed7c5a20a54851867ba5efef6>

- The first major sorting algorithm one learns in introductory programming courses.
-
- Gives an intro on how to convert unsorted data into sorted data.

> It's almost never used in production code because:

- _It's not efficient_
-
- _It's not commonly used_
-
- _There is stigma attached to it_

- _Bubbling Up : Term that infers that an item is in motion, moving in some direction, and has some final resting destination._

- _Bubble sort, sorts an array of integers by bubbling the largest integer to the top._

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/fd4acc0c89033bd219ebf9d3ec40b053>
<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/80934783c628c70ac2a5a48119a82d54>

- _Worst Case & Best Case are always the same because it makes nested loops._
-
- _Double for loops are polynomial time complexity or more specifically in this case Quadratic (Big O) of: O(n²)_

### Selection Sort

Time Complexity: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n²);

Space Complexity: O(1)

- Selection Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/4abc0fe0bf01599b0c4104b0ba633402>

- Selection sort organizes the smallest elements to the start of the array.

> Summary of how Selection Sort should work:

1. _Set MIN to location 0_

2. _Search the minimum element in the list._

3. _Swap with value at location Min_

4. _Increment Min to point to next element._

5. _Repeat until list is sorted._

### Insertion Sort

Time Complexity: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n²);

Space Complexity: O(n)

- Because we are creating a subArray for each element in the original input, our Space Comlexity becomes linear.

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/a9f4b8596c7546ac92746db659186d8c>

### Merge Sort

Time Complexity: Log Linear O(nlog(n))

- Since our array gets split in half every single time we contribute O(log(n)). The while loop contained in our helper merge function contributes O(n) therefore our time complexity is O(nlog(n)); Space Complexity: O(n)
-
- We are linear O(n) time because we are creating subArrays.

### Example of Merge Sort

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/18fbb7edc9f5c4820ccfcecacf3c5e48>
<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/cbb533137a7f957d3bc4077395c1ff64>

- **Merge sort is O(nlog(n)) time.**
-
- _We need a function for merging and a function for sorting._

> Steps:

1. _If there is only one element in the list, it is already sorted; return the array._

2. _Otherwise, divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no longer be divided._

3. _Merge the smallest lists into new list in a sorted order._

### Quick Sort

Time Complexity: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Even though the average time complexity O(nLog(n)), the worst case scenario is always quadratic.

Space Complexity: O(n)

- Our space complexity is linear O(n) because of the partition arrays we create.
-
- QS is another Divide and Conquer
-
- Some key ideas to keep in mind:

- It is easy to sort elements of an array relative to a particular target value.

- An array of 0 or 1 elements is already trivially sorted.

### Binary Search

Time Complexity: Log Time O(log(n))

Space Complexity: O(1)

> _Recursive Solution_

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/c82c00a4bcba4b69b7d326d6cad3ac8c>

> _Min Max Solution_

<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/eb8d1e1684db15cc2c8af28e13f38751>
<https://gist.github.com/eengineergz/bc3f576b9795ccef12a108e36f9f820a>

- _Must be conducted on a sorted array._
-
- _Binary search is logarithmic time, not exponential b/c n is cut down by two, not growing._

- _Binary Search is part of Divide and Conquer._

### Insertion Sort

- **Works by building a larger and larger sorted region at the left-most end of the array.**

> Steps:

1. _If it is the first element, and it is already sorted; return 1._

2. _Pick next element._

3. _Compare with all elements in the sorted sub list_

4. _Shift all the elements in the sorted sub list that is greater than the value to be sorted._

5. _Insert the value_

6. _Repeat until list is sorted._
