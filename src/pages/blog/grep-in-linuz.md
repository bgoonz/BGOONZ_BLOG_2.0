## What is the grep command in UNIX?

The `grep` command in UNIX is a command line utility for printing lines that match a pattern. It can be used to find text in a file and search a directory structure of files recursively. It also supports showing the context of a match by showing lines before and after the result and has support for regular expressions in pattern matching.

## How to find text in a file

To find text in a file pass the string you are looking for to `grep` followed by the name of the file or files.

```
grep 'computer' /usr/share/dict/words
computer
```

The `grep` tool will print occurrences that it finds to standard output.

## How to list line numbers for matches

To list line numbers and file names pass the `-n` option to grep. This prints matches to standard output along with the line number it was found on.

```
grep 'computer' -n /usr/share/dict/words
40565
```

This can be useful if you are looking to edit a file and want to launch vim and go straight to the line.

```
vim +40565 /usr/share/dict/words
```

## How to print lines before and after a match

To print lines before and after a match the `-A` and `-B` options can be used. Both expect a number and will print this number of lines.

```
grep -B 2 -A 2 'computer' /usr/share/dict/words
computativeness
compute
computer
computist
computus
```

Using the `-A` and `-B` options can be very useful for grepping through log files to see what occurred before and after the item of interest.

A further option is available in `-C` that will print the context of the match. This is equivalent to using both `-A` and `-B`.

```
grep -C 2 'computer' /usr/share/dict/words
computativeness
compute
computer
computist
computus
```

The `--context` option may also be used and defaults to two lines before and after if no number is given.

## How to count the number of matches

To count the number of matches use the `-c` option. This outputs a number count to standard output.

```
grep -c 'comput*' /usr/share/dict/words
50
```

## How to print the filename for a match

To print the filename for a match use the `-H` option. This is automatically invoked when `grep` is given more than one file to search.

```
grep -H 'computer' /usr/share/dict/words
/usr/share/dict/words:computer
```

## How to search recursively

To search for a pattern recursively use the `-R` option. This will search through all files in the directory tree that you have permission to read.

```
grep -R 'passwd' /etc
/etc/pam.d/su:# NIS (man nsswitch) as well as normal /etc/passwd and
/etc/pam.d/chpasswd:# The PAM configuration file for the Shadow 'chpasswd' service
```

## How to search for the inverse of a pattern

To search for the inverse of a pattern use the `-v` option. This will print inverse matches to standard output.

```
grep -v 'computer' /usr/share/dict/words
A
a
aa
aal
....
```

## How to ignore case when searching

To ignore case when searching use the `-i` option. By default `grep` will respect case.

```
grep 'COMPUTER' /usr/share/dict/words
# no match
grep -i 'COMPUTER' /usr/share/dict/words
computer
```

## How to use basic regular expressions when searching

To use basic regular expressions all versions of `grep` support basic character matches. In the following example the pattern matches ‘ia’ characters at the end of the line.

```
grep 'ia$' /usr/share/dict/words
abasia
Abelia
abepithymia
....
```

A great book for understanding the power of regular expressions is [Mastering Regular Expressions](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596528126.do).

## How to use extended regular expressions when searching

To use extended regular expressions use the `-e` option. The following line matches lines that do not contain the words ‘foo’ or ‘bar’.

```
grep -v -e 'foo' -e 'bar'
```

Note that in the GNU version of `grep` there is no difference in available functionality between basic and extended syntaxes.
