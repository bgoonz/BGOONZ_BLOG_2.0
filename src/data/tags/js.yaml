  ## [A high-level definition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript#a_high-level_definition "Permalink to A high-level definition")


  JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which ([HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS))

  The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:


  * Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called `name`.

  * Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the `name` variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris".

  * Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a `click` event in our example above to detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.

  * And much more!
