  ### 1. Site search gives users the information they want


  Site search is an effective tool for visitors to make the navigation of your site as easy as possible. **Users want to find what they are looking for *right now*.** They are accustomed to high-quality search options such as Google or YouTube that make the right content quickly accessible.


  Imagine the following scenario: A page visitor wants to find a pair of black jeans in size L on an e-commerce page. Instead of looking through the navigation and clicking through several layers of filters (men’s wear -> trousers -> jeans -> color: black -> size L), they can access the product they want instantly. Not only did they get to their result faster and save time, but they also could’ve investigated related offers to get them interested in other products (see more under reason #4)


  The results users are getting can even be personalized. With a high-quality site search option, you can offer user-specific results depending on their previous behavior. Better user experience on your site increases happiness and drives conversion.
