  Hello guys, Data Structure is a building block of programs. It's even said
  that  **\"Data Structure + Algorithms= Program\"**. That's why a good
  knowledge of data structure is very important for any programmers, including
  Java developers. Data structure gives you the option to store your data so
  that you can access it based on your requirement. For example, if you want a
  fast search based upon the username then you can use
  [HashMap](https://www.java67.com/2013/02/10-examples-of-hashmap-in-java-progr\
  amming-tutorial.html), but that's only possible if you know data structure and
  their implementations in the programming language you are using, and that's
  what you will learn in this article. \r

  \r

  Java API provides built-in support for common data structures, essential
  for writing programs like an array, linked list, map, set, stack, and queue.
  You don't need to implement these data structures by yourself, you can
  directly use them in your program, thanks to the rich and efficient
  implementation provided by Java API. \r

  \r

  This is also one reason [why Java is the best programming
  language](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2013/04/10-reasons-to-learn-java-p\
  rogramming.html). Since data structure is core to any program and the choice
  of a particular data structure significantly affects both the functionality
  and performance of Java applications, it's worth an effort to explore
  different data structures available in Java.\r

  \r

  Many of these data structure is part of the hugely popular Java Collection
  Framework, and almost all Java programs maybe, except [hello
  world](http://java67.blogspot.sg/2013/03/helloworld-in-java-how-to-write-comp\
  ile-example-tutorial.html) make use of Collection in one or another form. \r

  \r

  In this Java tutorial, we will take a look at a standard data structure.
  Array, linked list, Stack, Queue, Map, Set, and How they are implemented in
  Java, along with how to use them.\r

  \r

  Btw, if you are a complete beginner in the world of data structure and
  algorithms, then I also suggest you first go through a comprehensive course
  like [Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using
  Java](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offer\
  id=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fdata-s\
  tructures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java%2F) to learn the basics and
  master it.\r

  \r

  Data Structure and Algorithms are vital for becoming a better developer, and
  any investment you make in terms of your time, money, and learning effort will
  pay you for a long time to come.\r

  \r

  ## 6 Essential Data Structures for Java Developers\r

  \r

  Here is my list of the fundamental data structure from standard Java API and
  programming language itself, since an array is part of the programming
  language itself while others are part of the popular Java Collection
  framework.\r

  \r

  With Java 8 coming up with [Lambda
  expression](http://www.java67.com/2017/06/10-points-about-lambda-expressions-\
  in-java-8.html), [Functional
  Interface](https://www.java67.com/2018/10/java-8-stream-and-functional-progra\
  mming-interview-questions-answers.html), and
  [Streams](https://www.java67.com/2014/04/java-8-stream-examples-and-tutorial.\
  html), which is going to give a new life to Java Collection Framework,
  especially in the context of leveraging multiple core architecture of modern
  CPU.\r

  \r

  It’s high time that beginners make themselves aware of basic data structures
  available in Java programming and make the best use of them.\r

  \r

  ### 1\\. Array\r

  \r

  Java programming language provides built-in support for the array in the
  language itself. It has a special syntax to declare an array like int\\[\\],
  which is an array of primitive int types. You can create an array of both
  reference types and primitives. \r

  \r

  Also, unlike the C programming language, an array in Java is bounded, and
  you will get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException if you are working with an invalid
  index. \r

  \r

  Array in Java are also homogeneous, you can not store multiple types of
  objects in an array-like you can only store a String in a String\\[\\], if you
  try to store Integer, you will get ArrayStoreException at runtime. \r

  \r

  You can check further check [**Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive
  Using
  Java**](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&off\

  -structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java%2F) to learn more about array
  and other essential data structures and algorithms, and more importantly how
  to use them in Java Program.\r

  \r

  ### 2\\. Linked List\r

  \r

  Apart from the array, a linked list is another basic data structure in
  programming. Java provides a doubly-linked list implementation as
  java.util.LinkedList, this class can be used whenever a linked list data
  structure is needed. \r

  \r

  Since LinkedList is part of the Collection framework, it implements
  Collection and Iterable interface as well, which allows iterating over them.
  You can check this article to learn more about [LinkedList in
  Java](http://java67.blogspot.com/2012/12/difference-between-arraylist-vs-Link\
  edList-java.html).\r

  \r

  And, if you are revising Data structure concepts for FAANG interviews then I
  also suggest you join this amazing FAANG interview preparation course by
  Andrei Negaoi on Udemy. It's called Master the **[Coding Interview: Big Tech
  (FAANG)
  Interviews](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&m\
  url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fmaster-the-coding-interview-big-te\
  ch-faang-interviews%2F)** and it will help you prepare for Facebook, Apple,
  Amazon, NetFlix, and Google interviews.\r

  erviews%2F)\r

  \r

  ### 3\\. Hash table\r

  \r

  The Hash table, map, or dictionary is one of the most versatile data
  structures I have seen. I happen to use Map every now and then, and
  fortunately, Java API provides several implementations of Map data structure
  for different needs like HashMap, Hashtable, and ConcurrentHashMap.\r

  \r

  It's also known as map or dictionary data structure, you might have heard
  about Dictionary in Python, which is the same as Map in Java. \r

  \r

  A map provides you with O(1) functionality for getting a value back if you
  know the key, which is a very natural use case in most Java applications.\r

  \r

  You can further check the [**Algorithms and Data Structures - Part 1 and
  2**](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/1193463/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plu\
  ralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fads-part1) courses on Pluralsight to learn more about
  the Hash table, map, or dictionary data structure in Java.\r

  2/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fcourses%2Fads-part1)\r

  \r

  ### 4\\. Stack\r

  \r

  Java API also provides a Stack data structure implemented as
  java.util.Stack. This class extends the legacy Vector class for storing
  elements. Since the stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure, it
  provides a push() method to insert objects and a pop() method to consume
  elements from the top. \r

  \r

  The stack is quite popular in different programming tasks like evaluating
  expressions. By the way, don’t confuse Stack data structure with [stack
  memory](http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2013/01/difference-between-stack-an\
  d-heap-java.html), which is used to store local variable and method frames in
  Java.\r

  \r

  Btw, if you are refreshing your data structure concepts for Interviews, I
  also suggest you go through the [**Data Structures in Java: An Interview
  Refresher**](https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/57248228436\
  86912?affiliate_id=5073518643380224) course on Educative to prepare well for
  your interview.\r

  \r

  qfc0wM4pE4SO-xOp3rcVnTS5wCLcBGAs/s320/stack%2Bdata%2Bstrucutre.png)](https://\
  www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5724822843686912?affiliate_id=50\
  73518643380224)\r

  \r

  ### 5\\. Queue\r

  \r

  The queue data structure is also available in the Java collection framework
  as an interface and a few concrete implementations like
  [ArrayBlockingQueue](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/blocking-queu\
  e-in-java-example-ArrayBlockingQueue-LinkedBlockingQueue.html#axzz6iYmMFnsA),
  [LinkedList](https://www.java67.com/2012/12/difference-between-arraylist-vs-L\
  inkedList-java.html), and
  [PriorityQueue](http://www.java67.com/2015/07/how-to-use-priorityqueue-in-jav\
  a-example.html). \r

  \r

  Though you can also implement Queue by using LinkedList or array, it's much
  better to use existing classes, which are tried and tested. \r

  \r

  This not only reduces development time but also the overall code quality and
  performance of your application. BlockingQueue is a thread-safe extension of
  the Queue interface and can be used to implement [producer-consumer patterns
  in
  Java](http://javarevisited.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/producer-consumer-design-pa\
  ttern-with.html).\r

  \r

  ef5)\r

  \r

  ### 6\\. Set\r

  \r

  Set is a special data structure, which **doesn't allow duplicates**. It's a
  good data structure to store unique elements like Ids, for example,
  EmployeeId, OrderId, TradeId, etc. Whenever you are storing data that needs to
  be unique then you can use Set data structure. If you try to insert duplicates
  Set will not accept it and its method will return false to indicate that
  insertion has failed.\r

  \r

  Java Collection API provides a couple of implementations of Sets
  like [HashSet, TreeSet, and
  LinkedHashSet](http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/11/difference-between-t\
  reeset-hashset-vs-linkedhashset-java.html), which is more than enough for most
  situations. Those collections, apart from the beginning set, also provide
  sorting and insertion order.\r

  \r

  If you want to learn more about advanced data structures in Java, I highly
  recommend you to join **[Data Structures and Algorithms
  Specializatio](https://coursera.pxf.io/c/3294490/1164545/14726?u=https%3A%2F%\
  2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fdata-structures-algorithms)**n on
  Coursera. This specialization is a collection of 6 amazing Data structure
  courses to teach you graph, string, list, and many more essential and advanced
  data structures. \r

  \r

  The best thing about this program is that you get access to 50 algorithmic
  puzzles on your phone to brush up and level up your algorithmic skill as well
  100+ coding problems which are often asked by big tech companies. More
  importantly, you get instant feedback on whether your solution is correct or
  not. \r

  \r

  That's all about some of the most **essential Data Structures for Java
  developers**.  Apart from these basic data structures, there are a lot more in
  the Java collection framework, including concurrent data structures like
  BlockingQueue and ConcurrentHashMap. For a Java developer with any experience
  level, it's good to explore new collection classes introduced in Java 5 and 6
  for making better use of Java API.\r
