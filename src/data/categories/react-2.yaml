  React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. It is used by large, established companies and newly-minted startups alike (Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, and the New York Times, to name a few). React brings many advantages to the table, making it a better choice than other frameworks like Angular.js.
