# Needed packages
import numpy as np
import cv2
import pyautogui

# take screenshot using pyautogui
image = pyautogui.screenshot()

# since the pyautogui takes as a PIL(pillow) and in RGB we need to convert it to numpy array and BGR
# so we can write it to the disk
image = cv2.cvtColor(np.array(image), cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)

# writing it to the disk using opencv
cv2.imwrite("test.png", image)
