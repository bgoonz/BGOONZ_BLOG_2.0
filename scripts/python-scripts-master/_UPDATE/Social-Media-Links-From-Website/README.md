# Social Media Links Scraper

The code filters out all the social media links like youtube, instagram, linkedin etc. from the provided website url and displays as the output.

- The python script scrapes all the anchor tags from an input url and then filters out the social media links from the collection which is shown as an output.
- Added feature to take a csv file with several url links as input and provide an output csv file with the url followed by that website's social media links.

## Setup instructions

Before executing the file, install the python package `requests` for the script to work without any errors.

## Output
