## Use this code

First you'll need to type those lines :

```
 pip install pyttsx3

 pip install PyPDF2
```

## Improving the code

- Add the possiblity to save to .MP3
- Select the pages we would like to read
- Find a better TTS Voice

## Known issues

- Some PDF don't use spaces but positionning, at the moment I can't figure out how to take this into account other than using OCR.
