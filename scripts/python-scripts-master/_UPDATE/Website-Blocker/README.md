# Website Blocker using Python

This is a program which blocks certain distracting website like Facebook, Youtube etc during your work hours.

## Libraby Used

time (datetime is imported from python)

## Host Files

Host is an operating system file which maps hostnames to IP addresses.
Using python file handling manipulation I have changed hostnames on the hosts files for a certain interval of day when I'm working and need no distraction and deleted it then after when the time is over.

## Location of host file

### Host file on Mac and Linux :

    $ /etc/hosts

### Host file on windows :

    $ C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

## Note

- Windows user need to create a duplicate of OSâ€™s host file. Now provide the path of the duplicate file in hosts_path mentioned in the script.
- For scheduling above script in Linux you have to open crontab in your terminal as a root.(use sudo command)
