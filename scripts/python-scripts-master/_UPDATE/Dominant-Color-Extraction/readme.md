# DOMINANT COLOR DETECTION FROM IMAGE

## Introduction

1. Finding Dominant Colour: Finding Colour with Kmeans and giving appropriate colors to the
   pixel/data points of the image.
2. Analyse different K in K-means : Different Ks can give totally different results, and usually, there is one K which
   is consistent with the data points, the actual K.
3. Good Segmentation(Colour Extraction) : Given an image in a generic viewpoint, we wish to produce the best possible
   segmentation, by this we mean that most people would choose this segmentation if asked to make one, and it would
   make a good precursor for object recognition.

## How to use it :
