## How it works <br><br>

- In order to compute the simlilarity between two text documents, the textual raw data is transformed into vectors.
- Then it is transformed into arrays of numbers and then from that by using a basic knowledge vector to compute the the similarity between them.

## Dependencies<br>

- Install scikit-learn by:

$ pip install scikit-learn

## Running the app <br>

- There are four text documents in the repository.
- Basically the code will compare all the .txt files and check for any similarity.

$ python plagiarism.py
