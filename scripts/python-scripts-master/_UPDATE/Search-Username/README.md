### Disclaimer

Multiple request to a certain host within a short period of time can lead to a ban,
the author and the maintainers of the Repository condemn such usage of this script and in no way are responsible
for any mishaps.

With the increasing number of DDOS attacks, multiple hosts have started using their own APIs as a strict mode of
request transfer and communication, multiple of the supported platforms in future, might shift to APIs. (e.g. LinkedIN)

We recommend people to use APIs as they are the official means of communication, and follow the rules and guidelines.
