# Noise Reduction Script

Implementing a feature that helps to filter an audio file by reducing the background noise similar to "Audacity".

## Libraries used

Firstly import the following python libraries

- NumPy
- scipy.io.wavfile
- Matplotlib
- Os
  Save the audio files and your code in the same folder
  Run the python code

## Detailed explanation of method used for "Noise Reduction Script"

- Imported the required libraries (NumPy, scipy.io.wavfile, and Matplotlib)
- Read the input audio file using scipy.io.wavfile library
- Converting the audio file into an array containg all the information of the given audio file and intiallizing the frame value.
- Calculating the first fourier transform of each window of the noisy audio file
- Subtracting the noise spectral mean from input spectral, and istft (Inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform)
- Finally getting an audio file with reduction in the background noise at a much higher extent
