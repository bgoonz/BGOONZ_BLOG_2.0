## **Edge Detection of a image**

This script uses `OpenCV` for taking input and output for the image. In this we are using he `Canny algorithm` for the detection of the edge

## How to use it

### You can use this in two ways

- If your machine has any python intrepretor than you can go for [**Edge_Detection.py**](https://github.com/ShubhamGupta577/Amazing-Python-Scripts/blob/Edge-Detection-Using-OpenCV/Edge%20Detection/Edge_Detection.py)
  - For these you need to install **OpenCV** in your machine.
- Another way is to use the [**Google Colab file**](https://github.com/ShubhamGupta577/Amazing-Python-Scripts/blob/Edge-Detection-Using-OpenCV/Edge%20Detection/Edge_Detection.ipynb) which will be excecute on a cloud.

## Technologies used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Google Colab**
