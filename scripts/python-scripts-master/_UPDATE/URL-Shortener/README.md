# Url Shortener

Long URLs are not easy to handle, they are more manageable. Your URLs should be short and sweet. Thatâ€™s because long URLs confuse Google and other search engines. Short Urls are easy to share, and they can help to track and compile click data(One of the reasons that bit.ly has received so much attention lately).

**pyshorteners** is a Python lib to help you short and expand urls using the most famous URL Shorteners available. It has many implemented APIs (Bit.ly, Chilp.it, Cutt.ly, etc.)

Here's a demo of how to use the url-shortener.py script:
