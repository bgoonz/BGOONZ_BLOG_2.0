# Shortest Path Finder (GUI)

Shortest Path finder is a GUI application which finds the shortest possible path between two points placed by the user on the board. The shortest path is marked with "Purple" colour. The program also shows the area of the board tracked by the algorithm in "Red" colour to find the shortest path. The "Green" border represents the border of the area tracked. The user can create obstacles simply by clicking on the cell on the board which is represented by "Black" colour. The start point is marked with "Yellow" colour and the end point is marked with "Sky Blue" colour.

## Setup instructions

In order to run this script, You just need the following modules:

- **Pygame:** It is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Controls

- Click on boxes to mark start(Yellow Coloured) and end point(Sky Blue Coloured).
- Then make some obstacles(Black Coloured).
- Then finally press "SPACE" to find the shortest path between the start and end point.
- The shortest path is represented by "Purple
