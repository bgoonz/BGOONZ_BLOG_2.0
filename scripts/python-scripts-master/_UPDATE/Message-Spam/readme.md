# Email Spam detection

### This Script is all about to check wether the entered message is a spam or not spam using machine learning algorithm

Machine-learning algorithm: Naives-Bayes

### How to to run the script:

Sample data.csv is attached, you can take that data as refernce to build your machine learning model.
An emailspam.ipynb file is attached in the folder, to build a machine learning model.

first train the data set and save the model in the .pkl file, so that we can use that file for to build a complete sytsem.

After saving .pkl you can see a .py file were whole code runs, for the system. After running the script. You can just enter the text and check wether the message is an ham or an spam. Ham means not a spam message.
