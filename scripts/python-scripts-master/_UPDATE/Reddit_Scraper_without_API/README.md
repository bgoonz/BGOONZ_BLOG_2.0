# Reddit Scraper

- Using BeautifulSoup, a python library useful for web scraping, this script helps to scrape a desired subreddit to obtain all relevant data regarding its posts.

- In the `fetch_reddit.py` , we take user input for the subreddit name, tags and the maximum count of posts to be scraped, we fetch and store all this information in a database file.

- In the `display_reddit.py` , we display the desired results from the database to the user.

## Setup instructions

- The requirements can be installed as follows:

```shell
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
