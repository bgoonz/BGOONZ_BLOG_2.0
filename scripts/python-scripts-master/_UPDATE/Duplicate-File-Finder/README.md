# Duplicate File Finder

[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

Many a time, we find duplicate files residing in our Directories, especially documents and downloads, there are various
reasons:

- downloading the same file from various sources.
- auto backup on the cloud,
- it slipped out of our mind that we downloaded it already in the first place, etc.

Manually selecting them is actually a hassle, but why do such a boring task when
automation can do the trick. This sweet and simple script helps you to compare various files in a
directory, find the duplicate, list them out, and then even allows you to delete them.

**Sweet!!!**

## Setup

- Setup a `python 3.x` virtual environment.
- `Activate` the environment
- Install the dependencies using `pip3 install -r requiremnts.txt`
- You are all set and the [script](file_finder.py) is Ready to run.
- Clearly Follow the Instructions provided in the comments.

### Usage

In Command Line Interface, Run the script using -

`python image_finder.py <path of folder1, path of folder2, .....>`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. folder1 - _Parent Folder_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. folder2, folder3 .... - _Subsequent Folders_

> - This acts as a reference for duplicate files, i.e. this contains the original copy, hence no file is deleted from this folder.
> - Comparisons are done with in the folder, and from Parent to Subsequent Folders.

## Dependencies

1.  python3
2.  keyboard

## Detailed explanation

The Script works on a simple fundamental. Two files with same [`md5checksum`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) will
have similar contents. So in the script all we aim to do is determine the checksum, compare and find the duplicates.

## Output

- Running Script on a single folder `Stand_Alone`. In this example I pressed [n] in order to not delete anything.

- Final Result, Notice that all the files in `Parent` Folder remain as it is.

> Also notice that similar files but wth different extensions are not deleted, cause technically they aren't same.
