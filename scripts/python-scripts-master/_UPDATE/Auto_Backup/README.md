# Automatic_Backup

Automatic Backup and Compression of large file, sped up using Threading.
Multithreading helps in achieving MultiTasking using threads.

Along with Multithreading `gzip` has been used for Compressing large files.
I have made sur that the script required no additional library other than the basic standard packages.

## Setup instructions

As explained there is no specific `requirements.txt`. So no additional library or packages are required.

There are two files one `python` and one `notebook`. [`Auto_Backup.py`](./Auto_Backup.py)
is the script that can be quickly used to backup the desired file.

For greater understanding of the script and proof of concept, refer to [`Auto_Backup.ipynb`](./Auto_Backup.ipynb).
The Notebook has further illustrated the Script and is much more detailed.

```
Example Usage -

python Auto_backup.py -t ./MIREX_Backup -s ./MIREX_Dataset -c 100000

```
