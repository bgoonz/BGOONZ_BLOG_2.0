# Convert Text to Speech

## Description

Text to speech is a process to convert any text into voice. Text to speech project takes words on digital devices and convert them into audio with a button click or finger touch. Text to speech python project is very helpful for people who are struggling with reading.

## Project Prerequisites

To implement this project, we will use the basic concepts of Python, Tkinter, gTTS, and playsound libraries.

- **Tkinter** is a standard GUI Python library that is one of the fastest and easiest ways to build GUI applications using Tkinter.

- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** is a Python library, which is a very easy library that converts the text into audio.

- The **playsound** module is used to play audio files. With this module, we can play a sound file with a single line of code.

To install the required libraries, you can use pip install command:

```
pip install tkinter
pip install gTTS
pip install playsound
```

The objective of this project is to convert the text into voice with the click of a button. This project will be developed using Tkinter, gTTs, and playsound library.

In this project, we add a message which we want to convert into voice and click on play button to play the voice of that text message.

- Importing the modules
- Create the display window
- Define functions

So these are the basic steps that we will do in this Python project.

1. Import Libraries
   </br>
   Let’s start by importing the libraries: tkinter, gTTS, and playsound

2. Initializing window
   </br>

- **Tk()** to initialized tkinter which will be used for GUI
- **geometry()** used to set the width and height of the window
- **configure()** used to access window attributes
- **bg** will used to set the color of the background
- **title()** set the title of the window

**Label()** widget is used to display one or more than one line of text that users can’t able to modify.

- **root** is the name which we refer to our window
- **text** which we display on the label
- **font** in which the text is written
- **pack** organized widget in block
- **Msg** is a string type variable
- **Entry()** used to create an input text field
- **textvariable** used to retrieve the current text to entry widget
- **place()** organizes widgets by placing them in a specific position in the parent widget

3. Function to Convert Text to Speech in Python
   </br>

- **Message** variable will stores the value of entry_field
- **text** is the sentences or text to be read.
- **lang** takes the language to read the text. The default language is English.
- **slow** use to reads text more slowly. The default is False.

As we want the default value of lang, so no need to give that to gTTS.

- **speech** stores the converted voice from the text
- **playsound()** used to play the sound

4. Function to Exit
   </br>

**root.destroy()** will quit the program by stopping the mainloop()

5. Function to Reset
   </br>

**Reset** function set Msg variable to empty strings.

6. Define Buttons
   </br>

**Button()** widget used to display button on the window.
**root.mainloop()** is a method that executes when we want to run our program.
