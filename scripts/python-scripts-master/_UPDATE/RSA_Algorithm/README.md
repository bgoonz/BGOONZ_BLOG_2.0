# RSA Algorithm

- Python script that encrypts and decrypts a text based on [RSA algorithm](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf)
- It involves the concept of modular arithmatic and euler's theorem.
- It is also based on the idea that factorizing large numbers requires years.
- Here, the (a,n) are kept public and (p,q,b) are kept private.
