# Base-N Calculator

It is a GUI based script that allows user to enter a number of any base and convert it to another. However, there is a small limitation for the conversion.

- The base should not be smaller than 2.
- Alphabetic symbols are not used in conversions, you'll have to convert this part by yourself. To know why check this [link](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/bases.html)
