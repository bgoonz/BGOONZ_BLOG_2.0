        <p>Node.js can be installed in different ways. This post highlights the most common and convenient ones.</p>
        <p>
            Official packages for all the major platforms are available at
            <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" class="uri">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>.
        </p>
        <p>One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package manager. In this case, every operating system has its own.</p>
        <p>
            On macOS, <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> is the de-facto standard, and - once installed - allows you to install Node.js very easily, by
            running this command in the CLI:
        </p>
        <pre><code>brew install node</code></pre>
        <p>
            Other package managers for Linux and Windows are listed in
            <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/" class="uri">https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>nvm</code> is a popular way to run Node.js. It allows you to easily switch the Node.js version, and install new versions to try and easily
            rollback if something breaks, for example.
        </p>
        <p>It is also very useful to test your code with old Node.js versions.</p>
        <p>See <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm" class="uri">https://github.com/creationix/nvm</a> for more information about this option.</p>
        <p>
            My suggestion is to use the official installer if you are just starting out and you don’t use Homebrew already, otherwise, Homebrew is my favorite
            solution.
        </p>
        <p>In any case, when Node.js is installed you’ll have access to the <code>node</code> executable program in the command line.</p>
