# Object-oriented JavaScript marking guide

The aim of the tasks is to demonstrate an understanding of the JavaScript features covered in the [Object-oriented JavaScript for beginners](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS), [Object prototypes](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes), and [Inheritance in JavaScript](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance) lessons in Learn Web Development on MDN.

Note: If there is an error in your code, it will be outputted into the results panel on the page, to help you try to figure out the answer (or into the browser's JavaScript console, in the case of the downloadable version).

## Task 1

In this task we provide you with a `Shape` class containing only some data properties.

We want you to:
* add a constructor
* define a `calcPerimeter()` method
* create two instances of the class, a square and a triangle, and call their `calcPerimeter()` methods

Your code should look something like this:

```
class Shape {

  name;
  sides;
  sideLength;

  constructor(name, sides, sideLength) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sides = sides;
    this.sideLength = sideLength;
  }

  calcPerimeter() {
    console.log(`The ${ this.name }'s perimeter length is ${ this.sides * this.sideLength }.`);
  }

}

const square = new Shape('square', 4, 5);
square.calcPerimeter();

const triangle = new Shape('triangle', 3, 3);
triangle.calcPerimeter();
```

## Task 2

Next, we'd like you to start with the `Shape` class you created in the last task.

We'd like you to create a `Square` class that inherits from `Shape`, and adds a `calcArea()` method that calculates the square's area.

Create an instance of the `Square` called square with appropriate property values, and call its `calcPerimeter()` and `calcArea()` methods to show that it works.

Your code should look something like this:

```
class Shape {

  name;
  sides;
  sideLength;

  constructor(name, sides, sideLength) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sides = sides;
    this.sideLength = sideLength;
  }

  calcPerimeter() {
    console.log(`The ${ this.name }'s perimeter length is ${ this.sides * this.sideLength }.`);
  }

}

class Square extends Shape {

  constructor(sideLength) {
    super('square', 4, sideLength);
  }

  calcArea() {
    console.log(`The ${ this.name }'s area is ${ this.sideLength * this.sideLength } squared.`);
  }

}

const square = new Square(4);

square.calcPerimeter();
square.calcArea();
```
