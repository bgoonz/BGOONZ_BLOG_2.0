# JavaScript variables marking guide

The aim of the tasks is to demonstrate an understanding of the JavaScript features covered in the [Storing the information you need — Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables) lesson in Learn Web Development on MDN.

Note: If there is an error in your code, it will be outputted into the results panel on the page, to help you try to figure out the answer (or into the browser's JavaScript console, in the case of the downloadable version).

## Task 1

This task covers basic understanding of declaring a variable with a value, and initializing it — both separately and at the same time. Ideally your code should look something like this:

```
let myName;
myName = 'Chris';
let myAge = 42;
```

`let` is ideal for both declarations. `const` is not really appropriate, as such values might change, and it won't work in the first instance.  `var` is not OK.

The `myAge` value will work whether you've initialised it with a numeric (no quotes) or string (quotes) value, however it is a numeric value, so using quotes for it isn't correct.

## Task 2

In task 2 the student needs to add a new line to correct the `myName` variable value so that it outputs their name on the screen.

The finished code should look something like this:

```
let myName = 'Paul';
myName = 'Chris';
```

## Task 3

The last task in this article focuses around fixing some variable-related errors. Basically:

1. The `myAge` variable is not being outputted correctly because it is being declared once using `const`, and then an attempt is being made to change the value.
2. The result of the sum is not being outputted correctly because the `myAge` variable is being declared as a number. It needs to have the quotes removed.

The solution should look something like this:

```
let myName = 'Default';
myName = 'Chris'

let myAge = 42;
```
