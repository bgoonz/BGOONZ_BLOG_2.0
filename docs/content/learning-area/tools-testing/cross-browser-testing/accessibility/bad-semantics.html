    <font size="7">My heading</font>
    <br><br>
    This is the first section of my document.
    <br><br>
    I'll add another paragraph here too.

    <font size="5">My subheading</font>
    <br><br>
    This is the first subsection of my document. I'd love people to be able to find this content!
    <br><br>
    <font size="5">My 2nd subheading</font>
    <br><br>
    This is the second subsection of my content. I think is more interesting than the last one.
