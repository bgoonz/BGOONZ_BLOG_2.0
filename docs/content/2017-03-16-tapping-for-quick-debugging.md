This little beastie here is tap. A really useful function for quick-debugging
chains of function calls, anonymous functions and, actually, whatever you just
want to print.

```javascript
function tap(x) {
    console.log(x);
    return x;
}
```

Why would you use instead of good old `console.log`? Let me show you an example:

```javascript
bank_totals_by_client(bank_info(1, banks), table)
    .filter((c) => c.balance > 25000)
    .sort((c1, c2) => (c1.balance <= c2.balance ? 1 : -1))
    .map((c) => console.log(`${c.id} | ${c.tax_number} (${c.name}) => ${c.balance}`));
```

Now, suppose you're getting nothing from this chain (possibly an error).
Where is it failing? Maybe `bank_info` isn't returning anything, so we'll tap it:

```javascript
bank_totals_by_client(tap(bank_info(1, banks)), table);
```

Depending on our particular implementation, it might print something or not.
I'll assume the information that we got from our tapping was correct and
therefore, bank_info isn't causing anything.

We must then move on to the next chain, filter.

```javascript
            .filter(c => tap(c).balance > 25000)
```

Are we receiving any c's (clients actually)? If so, then bank_totals_by_client
works alright. Maybe it's the condition within the filter?

```javascript
            .filter(c => tap(c.balance > 25000))
```

Ah! Sweet, we see nothing but `false` printed, so there's no client with >25000,
that's why the function was returning nothing.

## (Bonus) A more advanced tap.

```javascript
function tap(x, fn = (x) => x) {
    console.log(fn(x));
    return x;
}
```

Now we're talking about a more advanced beast, what if we wanted to perform a
certain operation _prior_ to tapping? i.e, we want to access a certain object
property, perform a logical operation, etc. with our tapped object? Then we
call old good tap with an extra argument, a function to be applied at the moment
of tapping.

```javascript
tap(3, (x) => x + 2) === 3; // prints 5, but expression evaluates to true, why :-)?
```
