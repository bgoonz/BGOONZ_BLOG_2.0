tip-tldr: A good solution for the looseness of equality comparisons in javascript

categories: - en - javascript

We all know that JavaScript is loosely typed and in some cases it fall behind specially when it comes to quality comparison with '==', comparing with '==' gives unexpected results due to whats called coercion or casting "converting one of the 2 operands to the other's type then compare".

```javascript
0 == ' '; //true
(null == undefined[1]) == //true
    true; //true
```

So they provided us with the triple equal operator '===' which is more strict and does not coerce operands, However comparing with '===' is not the best solution you can get:

```javascript
NaN === NaN; //false
```

The great news that in ES6 there is the new 'Object.is()' which is better and more precise it has the same features as '===' and moreover it behaves well in some special cases:

```javascript
Object.is(0, ' '); //false
Object.is(null, undefined); //false
Object.is([1], true); //false
Object.is(NaN, NaN); //true
```

Mozilla team doesn't think that Object.is is "stricter" than '===', they say that we should think of how this method deal with NaN, -0 and +0 but overall I think it is now a good practice in real applications.

Now this table illustrates..
