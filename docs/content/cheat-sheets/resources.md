    A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for
    every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its
    standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally,
    libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking
    behavior the exception rather than the norm.
