## Function

### Writing functions

```fish
function my_function --description "My description"
  ···
end
```

### Conditional

```fish
if test -f foo.txt
  ···
else if test -f bar.txt
  ···
else
  ···
end
```

### Combining tests

```fish
if test -f foo.txt && test -f bar.txt
```

```fish
if test -f foo.txt -a -f bar.txt
```

```fish
if test \( -f foo.txt \) -a -f \( bar.txt \)
```

### Events

#### Emitting

```fish
emit my_event
```

#### Listening

```fish
function myhook --on-event my_event
  ···
end
```

This lets you hook onto events, such as `fish_prompt`.

## Completions

### Creating completions

#### ~/.fish/completions/mycommand.fish

```fish
complete -c mycommand ...
complete -c mycommand ...
complete -c mycommand ...
```

### Options

```fish
complete \
  -c                         # command
  -s                         # short option
  -l                         # long option
  -r, --require-parameter
  -f, --no-files
  -x                         # exclusive (-r -f)
  -n '__fish_use_subcommand' # condition
  --description ".."
```

#### Example

```fish
  complete -c $cmd \
-n '__fish_use_subcommand' \
-x -a hello \
--description 'lol'
```
