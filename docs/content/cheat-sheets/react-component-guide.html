<h2 id="a-basic-component">A Basic Component</h2>
<p>The key abstraction that React provides is that of a component. To reiterate, a component is some thing that is being rendered in the browser. It could be a button, a form with a bunch of fields in it, a navigation bar at the top of the page, a single input field, etc. Any of these could be its own component. React doesn’t place any restrictions on how large or small a component can be. You <em>could</em> have an entire static site encapsulated in a single React component, but that at that point you may as well not be using React. So the first thing to remember about a component is that a component must <em>render</em> something. If nothing is being rendered from a component, then React will throw an error.</p>
<p>Let’s write the most basic of components we can possibly write. Inside of <code>BasicComponent.js</code>, first import React at the top of the file. Our most basic of components looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>import React from &#39;react&#39;;

const BasicComponent = () =&gt; &lt;div&gt;Hello World!&lt;/div&gt;;

export default BasicComponent;</code></pre>
<p>This is a component that simply returns a div tag with the words Hello World! inside. The last line simply exports our component so that it can be imported by another file.</p>
<p>Notice that this component looks exactly like an anonymous arrow function that we’ve named <code>BasicComponent</code>. In fact, that is literally what this is. Nothing more, nothing less. The arrow function then is simply returning the div tag. When a component is written as a function like this one is, it is called a <em>functional</em> component.</p>
<p>While a component can of course get a lot more complicated than this, fundamentally, all a component does is render some HTML.</p>
<h2 id="a-basic-class-component">A Basic Class Component</h2>
<p>The basic component you wrote in the previous exercise is an example of a functional component, which is appropriate since that component is literally nothing more than a function that returns some HTML. Functional components are great when all you want a component to do is to render some stuff; they are really good at doing just that.</p>
<p>Components can also be written as classes. For this exercise, we’re going to write a class component that does exactly the same thing as the functional component we just wrote. We’ll again need to import React at the top of the file, but we’ll also need to add a little something. Our import statement will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>So, in addition to importing React, we’re also importing the base Component class that is included in the React library. The export statement at the bottom of the file also stays, completely unchanged. Our class component will thus look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;

class BasicClassComponent extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;Hello World!&lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}

export default BasicClassComponent;</code></pre>
<p>Notice that our <code>BasicClassComponent</code> inherits from the base <code>Component</code> class that we imported from the React library, by virtue of the ‘extends’ keyword. That being said, there’s nothing in this minimal component that takes advantage of any of those inherited methods. All we have is a method on our component class called <code>render</code> that returns the same div tag.</p>
<p>In this case, if we really were deciding between whether to use a functional component versus a class component to render a simple div tag, then the functional style is more appropriate to use. This is because class components are much better suited for handling component state and triggering events based on the component’s lifecycle. Don’t worry if you don’t know what all these terms meant, we will get to them shortly.</p>
<p>The important takeaways at this point are that there are two types of components, functional and class components, and that functional components are well-suited if you’re just looking to render some HTML. Class components, on the other hand, are much better suited for handling components that require more complex functionality, need to exhibit more varied behavior, and/or need to keep track of some state that may change throughout said component’s lifecycle.</p>
<h2 id="a-class-component-with-some-state">A Class Component with Some State</h2>
<p>When we talked about class components, it was mentioned that class components can handle state. So what does that mean? Component state is any dynamic data that we want the component to keep track of. For example, let’s say we have a form component. This form has some input fields that we’d like users to fill out. When a user types characters into an input field, how is that input persisted from the point of view of our form component?</p>
<p>The answer is by using component state! There are a few important concepts regarding component state, such as how to update it, pass it to another component, render it, etc. We’ll talk about all of these in a bit, but for now, let’s just focus on how to add state to a class component.</p>
<p>Only class components have the ability to persist state, so if at any time you realize that a component needs to keep track of some state, you know that you’ll automatically need a class component instead of a functional component.</p>
<p>Our class component with state will look a lot like the basic class component we just wrote, but with some extra stuff:</p>
<pre><code>import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;

class ClassComponentWithState extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {};
    }

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;Hello World!&lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}

export default ClassComponentWithState;</code></pre>
<p>So far, the only new thing going on here is the constructor block. If you recall how classes in JavaScript work, classes need constructors. Additionally, if a class is extending off of another class and wants access to its parent class’s methods and properties, then the <code>super</code> function needs to be called inside the class’s constructor function. Point being, the constructor function and the call to the <code>super</code> function are <em>not</em> associated with React, they are associated with all JavaScript classes.</p>
<p>Then there is the <code>this.state</code> property inside the constructor function that is set as an empty object. We’re adding a property called <code>state</code> to our class and setting it to an empty object. State objects in React are always just plain old objects.</p>
<p>The observant student may be wondering why the basic class component we wrote in the previous exercise had no constructor function within its body. That is because we had no need for them since all our class component was doing was rendering some HTML. The constructor is needed here because that is where we need to initialize our state object. The call to <code>super</code> is needed because we can’t reference <code>this</code> inside of our constructor without a call to <code>super</code> first.</p>
<p>Ok, now let’s actually use this state object. One very common application of state objects in React components is to render the data being stored inside them within our component’s render function. Let’s change our current class component to do that.</p>
<pre><code>class ClassComponentWithState extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {
            someData: 8
        };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;{`Here&#39;s some data to render: ${this.state.someData}`}&lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}

export default ClassComponentWithState;</code></pre>
<p>So what’s changed here? Well, we added a key-value pair to our state object inside our constructor. Then we changed the contents of the render function. Now, it’s actually rendering the data that we have inside the state object. Notice that inside the div tags we’re using a template string literal so that we can access the value of <code>this.state.someData</code> straight inside of our rendered content. This is a very handy piece of functionality that React provides for us when writing components.</p>
<p>With React’s newest version, we can actually now add state to a component without explicitly defining a constructor on the class. We can refactor our class component to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>class ClassComponentWithState extends Component {
    state = {
        someData: 8
    };

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;{`Here&#39;s some data to render: ${this.state.someData}`}&lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}

export default ClassComponentWithState;</code></pre>
<p>Our code is slightly cleaner, and doesn’t require as many keystrokes as the older version. Fewer keystrokes are always a plus in my book! This new syntax is what is often referred to as ‘syntactic sugar’: under the hood, the React library translates this back into the old constructor code that we first started with, so that the JavaScript remains valid to the JavaScript interpreter. The clue to this is the fact that when we want to access some data from the state object, we still need to call it with <code>this.state.someData</code>; changing it to just <code>state.someData</code> does not work.</p>
<p>While being able to write our code in this way is nice and convenient, going forward, I’m going to stick with the ‘older’ style of writing my React components by explicitly defining constructors so that you’ll all have a better idea of what’s going on under the hood. In other words, it’s more "pedagogically sound”. If you prefer the newer style (and I would in my own code), feel free to write your React components that way.</p>
<h2 id="class-component-updating-state">Class Component Updating State</h2>
<p>Great, so we can render some state that our component persists for us. However, we said an important use case of component state is to handle <em>dynamic</em> data. A single static number isn’t very dynamic at all. So now let’s walk through how to update component state.</p>
<pre><code>import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;

class ClassComponentUpdatingState extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      aNumber: 8
    };
  }

  increment = () =&gt; {
    this.setState({ aNumber: ++this.state.aNumber });
  };

  decrement = () =&gt; {
    this.setState({ aNumber: --this.state.aNumber });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;{`Our number: ${this.state.aNumber}`}&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={this.increment}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;button onClick={this.decrement}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default ClassComponentUpdatingState;</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we’ve added two methods to our class: <code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code>. <code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code> are methods that <em>we</em> are adding to our class component. Unlike the <code>render</code> method,<code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code> were not already a part of our class component. This is why <code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code> are written as arrow functions, so that they are automatically bound to our class component. This needs to happen so that we can call them later on. Again, there’s no crazy React black magic going on here, we simply added two methods to our class.</p>
<p>The more interesting thing is what is going on within the bodies of these methods. Each calls this funky <code>setState</code>function. <code>setState</code> in fact <em>is</em> provided to us by React. It is the canonical way to update a component’s state. Actually, it’s the <em>only</em> way you should ever update a component’s state. It may seem more verbose than necessary, but there are good reasons for why you should be doing it this way. I’m not going to get into those reasons now. I’ll leave a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate">link</a> to the official documentation on the <code>setState</code> function, although I’m pretty sure at this point it will probably just blow your mind and/or overwhelm you with jargon. So for now, take this as a case of "because I’m telling you so”.</p>
<p>So the way to use <code>setState</code> to update a component’s state is to pass it an object with each of the state keys you wish to update, along with the updated value. In our <code>increment</code> method we said "I would like to update the <code>aNumber</code> property on my component state by adding one to it and then setting the new value as my new <code>aNumber</code>”. The same thing happens in our <code>decrement</code> method, only we’re subtracting instead of adding.</p>
<p>Then the other new concept we’re running into here is how to actually call these methods we’ve added to our class. We added two HTML button tags within our <code>render</code> function, then in their respective <code>onClick</code> handlers, we specify the method that should be called whenever this button gets clicked. So whenever we click either of the buttons, our state gets updated appropriately and our component will re-render to show the correct value we’re expecting.</p>
<h2 id="class-component-iterating-state">Class Component Iterating State</h2>
<p>Another common state pattern you’ll see being used in React components is iterating over an array in our state object and rendering each array element in its own tag. This is often used in order to render lists.</p>
<p>Additionally, we want to be able to easily update lists and have React re-render our updated list. We’ll see how both of these are done and how they work together within a single component in order to create the behavior of a dynamic list.</p>
<pre><code>import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;

class ClassComponentIteratingState extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();

        this.state = {
            ingredients: [&#39;flour&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;sugar&#39;, &#39;vanilla extract&#39;],
            newIngredient: &#39;&#39;
        };
    }

    handleIngredientInput = (event) =&gt; {
        this.setState({ newIngredient: event.target.value });
    };

    addIngredient = (event) =&gt; {
        event.preventDefault();
        const ingredientsList = this.state.ingredients;
        ingredientsList.push(this.state.newIngredient);
        this.setState({
            newIngredient: &#39;&#39;,
            ingredients: ingredientsList
        });
    };

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                {this.state.ingredients.map(ingredient =&gt; &lt;div&gt;{ingredient}&lt;/div&gt;)}
                &lt;form onSubmit={this.addIngredient}&gt;
                    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; onChange={this.handleIngredientInput} placeholder=&quot;Add a new ingredient&quot; value={this.state.newIngredient} /&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}

export default ClassComponentIteratingState;</code></pre>
<p>The first change to note is that our state object now has an ‘ingredients’ array, and a ‘newIngredient’ field that has been initialized to an empty string. The ingredients array contains the elements that we’ll want to render in our list. We’ll see shortly why the newIngredient field is needed.</p>
<p>The <code>addIngredient</code> and <code>handleIngredientInput</code> methods we’ve added to our class receives a parameter called ‘event’. This event object is part of the browser’s API. When we interact with some DOM element, such as clicking on an HTML button, the function that is invoked upon that button being clicked actually receives the event object. So when we type some input into an input tag, we’re able grab each character that was typed into the input field through the event object paramter.</p>
<p>The <code>handleIngredientInput</code> method is what gets invoked every time the user presses a key to enter text in the input box for adding a new ingredient. Every character the user types gets persisted in the <code>newIngredient</code> field on the state object. We’re able to grab the text in the input box using <code>event.target.value</code>, which holds the value of the string text that is currently in the input box. We use that to update our <code>newIngredient</code> string field.</p>
<p>Breaking down the <code>addIngredient</code> method, we see this <code>event.preventDefault()</code> invocation. This is because this method will be used upon submitting a form, and it turns out that submitting a form triggers some default form behavior that we don’t want to trigger when we submit the form (namely refreshing the entire page). <code>event.preventDefault()</code> will prevent this default form behavior, meaning our form will only do what we want it to do when it is submitted.</p>
<p>Next, we store a reference to <code>this.state.ingredients</code> in a variable called <code>ingredientsList</code>. So we now have a copy of the array that is stored in our state object. We want to update the copy of the ingredients array first instead of directly updating the actual array itself in state. This is a React best practice.</p>
<p>Now we push whatever value is being stored at our <code>newIngredient</code> field onto the <code>ingredientsList</code> array so that our <code>ingredientsList</code> array is now more up-to-date than our <code>this.state.ingredients</code> array. So all we have to do now is call <code>setState</code> appropriately in order to update the value in our state object. Additionally, we also set the <code>newIngredient</code> field back to an empty string in order to clear out the input field once we submit a new ingredient. Now it’s ready to accept more user input!</p>
<p>Looking at our render function, first note the <code>this.state.ingredients.map</code> call. This is looping through each ingredient in our <code>ingredients</code> array and returning each one within its own div tag. This is a very common syntax for rendering everything inside an array.</p>
<p>Then we have an HTML form which contains an input field. The purpose of this form is to allow a user to add new ingredients to the list. Note that we’re passing our <code>addIngredient</code> method to the form’s <code>onSubmit</code> handler. This means that our <code>addIngredient</code> method gets invoked whenever our form is submitted.</p>
<p>Lastly, the input field has an <code>onChange</code> handler that invokes our <code>handleIngredientInput</code> method whenever there is some sort of change in the input field, namely when a user types into it. Notice that the <code>value</code> field in our input tag reads off of <code>this.state.newIngredient</code> in order to know what value to display. So when a user enters text into the input field, the <code>onChange</code> handler is invoked every time, which updates our <code>this.state.newIngredient</code> field, which the input field then renders.</p>
<h2 id="parent-and-child-components">Parent and Child Components</h2>
<p>Now let’s get into talking about how to have components interact with each other. A single isolated component isn’t going to do us much good. That being said, it’s <em>possible</em> to simply throw all of the HTML for a page into a single React component, though at that point that one component would be so bloated and monolithic that you might as well not have used React at all.</p>
<p>The beauty of React lies in the fact that it allows us to compose modular components together. Let’s start off with the component we just saw, but let’s change its name to <code>ParentComponent</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;
import ChildComponent from &#39;./ChildComponent&#39;;

class ParentComponent extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();

        this.state = {
            ingredients: [&#39;flour&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;milk&#39;, &#39;sugar&#39;, &#39;vanilla&#39;],
            newIngredient: &#39;&#39;
        };
    }

    handleIngredientInput = (event) =&gt; {
        this.setState({ newIngredient: event.target.value });
    };

    addIngredient = (event) =&gt; {
        event.preventDefault();
        const ingredientsList = this.state.ingredients;
        ingredientsList.push(this.state.newIngredient);
        this.setState({
            newIngredient: &#39;&#39;,
            ingredients: ingredientsList
        });
    };

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
                {this.state.ingredients.map(ingredient =&gt; &lt;ChildComponent thing={ingredient} /&gt;)}
                &lt;form onSubmit={this.addIngredient}&gt;
                    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; onChange={this.handleIngredientInput} placeholder=&quot;Add a new ingredient&quot; value={this.state.newIngredient} /&gt;
                &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    }
}

export default ParentComponent;</code></pre>
<p>The only two other differences in this component are that we’re importing a <code>ChildComponent</code> and then using it inside our <code>this.state.ingredients.map</code> call. <code>ChildComponent</code> is another React component. Notice that we’re using it just as if it were any other HTML tag. This is how we lay out our component hierarchy: the ChildComponent is rendered within the ParentComponent. We can see this to be the case if we open up the developer console and inspect these elements.</p>
<p>Note also that we’re passing each ingredient as a ‘thing’ to the ChildComponent component. This is how a parent component passes data to a child component. It doesn’t need to be called ‘thing’; you can call it whatever you want. Conceptually though, every piece of data that a parent component passes down to a child component is called a ‘prop’ in React lingo.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look now at the Child Component. It serves two purposes: 1) to render the props data that it gets from a parent component, and 2) to add the ability for a user to click on it and have it toggle a strikethrough, indicating that the item is ‘complete’.</p>
<pre><code>import React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;

class ChildComponent extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      clicked: false
    };
  }

  handleClick = () =&gt; {
    this.setState({ clicked: !this.state.clicked });
  };

  render() {
    const styles = this.state.clicked ? { textDecoration: &#39;line-through&#39;} : { textDecoration: &#39;none&#39; };
    return (
      &lt;div style={styles} onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;{this.props.thing}&lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default ChildComponent;</code></pre>
<p>The overall structure of the child component is nothing we haven’t seen. It’s just another class component with its own state object and a method called <code>handleClick</code>.</p>
<p>A component accesses its props via the <code>this.props</code> object. Any prop a parent component passes down to a child component is accessible inside the child component’s <code>this.prop</code> object.</p>
<p>So our child component keeps its own state that tracks whether the component has been clicked or not. Then at the top of the <code>render</code> function, it uses a ternary condition to determine whether the div tag that is being rendered should have a strikethrough or not. The <code>handleClick</code> method is then invoked via an <code>onClick</code> handler on the div tag; it does the work of toggling the <code>this.state.clicked</code> boolean.</p>
<p>The overall structure of React applications can be represented as a hierarchical tree structure, just like how the DOM itself is structure. There is an overarching root component at the top of the hierarchy that every other component sits underneath. Specifying that a component should be a child of some parent component is as simple as throwing it in the parent component’s render function, just like how we did it in this example.</p>

<p>This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.</p>

<p>JSX produces React "elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html">next section</a>. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.</p>
<h2 id="why-jsx">Why JSX?</h2>
<p>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.</p>
<p>Instead of artificially separating <em>technologies</em> by putting markup and logic in separate files, React <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separates <em>concerns</em></a> with loosely coupled units called "components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html">further section</a>, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY">this talk</a> might convince you otherwise.</p>
<p>React <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html">doesn’t require</a> using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="embedding-expressions-in-jsx">Embedding Expressions in JSX</h2>
<p>In the example below, we declare a variable called <code>name</code> and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:</p>
<pre><code>const name = &#39;Josh Perez&#39;;const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>
<p>You can put any valid <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions">JavaScript expression</a> inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, <code>2 + 2</code>, <code>user.firstName</code>, or <code>formatName(user)</code> are all valid JavaScript expressions.</p>
<p>In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, <code>formatName(user)</code>, into an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element.</p>
<pre><code>function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + &#39; &#39; + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: &#39;Harper&#39;,
  lastName: &#39;Perez&#39;
};

const element = (
  &lt;h1&gt;    Hello, {formatName(user)}!  &lt;/h1&gt;);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/oNwgZgm">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/oNwgZgm</a></p>
<p>We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/2846283">automatic semicolon insertion</a>.</p>
<h2 id="jsx-is-an-expression-too">JSX is an Expression Too</h2>
<p>After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.</p>
<p>This means that you can use JSX inside of <code>if</code> statements and <code>for</code> loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:</p>
<pre><code>function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {formatName(user)}!&lt;/h1&gt;;  }
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Stranger.&lt;/h1&gt;;}</code></pre>
<h2 id="specifying-attributes-with-jsx">Specifying Attributes with JSX</h2>
<p>You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:</p>
<pre><code>const element = &lt;div tabIndex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;;</code></pre>
<p>You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:</p>
<pre><code>const element = &lt;img src={user.avatarUrl}&gt;&lt;/img&gt;;</code></pre>
<p>Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning:Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="specifying-children-with-jsx">Specifying Children with JSX</h2>
<p>If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with <code>/&gt;</code>, like XML:</p>
<pre><code>const element = &lt;img src={user.avatarUrl} /&gt;;</code></pre>
<p>JSX tags may contain children:</p>
<pre><code>const element = (
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Good to see you here.&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;);</code></pre>
<h2 id="jsx-prevents-injection-attacks">JSX Prevents Injection Attacks</h2>
<p>It is safe to embed user input in JSX:</p>
<pre><code>const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = &lt;h1&gt;{title}&lt;/h1&gt;;</code></pre>
<p>By default, React DOM <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html">escapes</a> any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS (cross-site-scripting)</a> attacks.</p>
<h2 id="jsx-represents-objects">JSX Represents Objects</h2>
<p>Babel compiles JSX down to <code>React.createElement()</code> calls.</p>
<p>These two examples are identical:</p>
<pre><code>const element = (
  &lt;h1 className=&quot;greeting&quot;&gt;
    Hello, world!
  &lt;/h1&gt;);</code></pre>
<pre><code>const element = React.createElement(
  &#39;h1&#39;,
  {className: &#39;greeting&#39;},
  &#39;Hello, world!&#39;
);</code></pre>
<p><code>React.createElement()</code> performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:</p>
<pre><code>// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: &#39;h1&#39;,
  props: {
    className: &#39;greeting&#39;,
    children: &#39;Hello, world!&#39;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>These objects are called "React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.</p>
<p>We will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html">next section</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip:We recommend using the "Babel” language definition for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX code is properly highlighted.</p>

<h2 id="rendering-elements"><strong>Rendering Elements</strong></h2>
<h2 id="elements-are-the-smallest-building-blocks-of-react-apps.">Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.</h2>
<p>An element describes what you want to see on the screen:</p>
<p><code>const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;;</code></p>
<p>Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of "components”. We will introduce components in the next section. Elements are what components are "made of”, and we encourage you to read this section before jumping ahead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="rendering-an-element-into-the-dom">Rendering an Element into the DOM</h2>
<p>Let’s say there is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> somewhere in your HTML file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>We call this a "root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.</p>
<p>Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.</p>
<p>To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to <code>[ReactDOM.render()](&lt;https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render&gt;)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;));</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/render-an-element"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/mdwyWeb?editors=0010">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/mdwyWeb?editors=0010</a></p>
<p>It displays "Hello, world” on the page.</p>
<h2 id="updating-the-rendered-element">Updating the Rendered Element</h2>
<p>React elements are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable</a>. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.</p>
<p>With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to <code>[ReactDOM.render()](&lt;https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render&gt;)</code>.</p>
<p>Consider this ticking clock example:</p>
<pre><code>function tick() {
  const element = (
    &lt;div&gt;      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;);
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;));}

setInterval(tick, 1000);</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/eYRmvNy?editors=0010">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/eYRmvNy?editors=0010</a></p>
<p>It calls <code>[ReactDOM.render()](&lt;https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render&gt;)</code> every second from a <code>[setInterval()](&lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval&gt;)</code> callback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.We recommend that you don’t skip topics because they build on each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="react-only-updates-whats-necessary">React Only Updates What’s Necessary</h2>
<p>React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.</p>
<p>You can verify by inspecting the <a href="https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/update-rendered-element">last example</a> with the browser tools:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://reactjs.org/c158617ed7cc0eac8f58330e49e48224/granular-dom-updates.gif" alt="https://reactjs.org/c158617ed7cc0eac8f58330e49e48224/granular-dom-updates.gif" /><figcaption>https://reactjs.org/c158617ed7cc0eac8f58330e49e48224/granular-dom-updates.gif</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM.</p>
<p>In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.</p>
<h2 id="components-and-props"><strong>Components and Props</strong></h2>
<h2 id="components-let-you-split-the-ui-into-independent-reusable-pieces-and-think-about-each-piece-in-isolation.-this-page-provides-an-introduction-to-the-idea-of-components.-you-can-find-a-detailed-component-api-reference-here.">Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html">detailed component API reference here</a>.</h2>
<p>Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.</p>
<h2 id="function-and-class-components">Function and Class Components</h2>
<p>The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:</p>
<pre><code>function Welcome(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
}</code></pre>
<p>This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single "props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components "function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.</p>
<p>You can also use an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">ES6 class</a> to define a component:</p>
<pre><code>class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.</p>
<p>Function and Class components both have some additional features that we will discuss in the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">next sections</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-a-component">Rendering a Component</h2>
<p>Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:</p>
<pre><code>const element = &lt;div /&gt;;</code></pre>
<p>However, elements can also represent user-defined components:</p>
<pre><code>const element = &lt;Welcome name=&quot;Sara&quot; /&gt;;</code></pre>
<p>When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object "props”.</p>
<p>For example, this code renders "Hello, Sara” on the page:</p>
<pre><code>function Welcome(props) {  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

const element = &lt;Welcome name=&quot;Sara&quot; /&gt;;ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/rendering-a-component"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/QWgwpjd?editors=0010">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/QWgwpjd?editors=0010</a></p>
<p>Let’s recap what happens in this example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We call <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> with the <code>&lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt;</code> element.</li>
<li>React calls the <code>Welcome</code> component with <code>{name: 'Sara'}</code> as the props.</li>
<li>Our <code>Welcome</code> component returns a <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Sara&lt;/h1&gt;</code> element as the result.</li>
<li>React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello, Sara&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example,</p>
<p>represents an HTML div tag, but represents a component and requires Welcome to be in <a href="http://scope.to">scope.To</a> learn more about the reasoning behind this convention, please read JSX In Depth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="composing-components">Composing Components</h2>
<p>Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.</p>
<p>For example, we can create an <code>App</code> component that renders <code>Welcome</code> many times:</p>
<pre><code>function Welcome(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;      &lt;Welcome name=&quot;Sara&quot; /&gt;      &lt;Welcome name=&quot;Cahal&quot; /&gt;      &lt;Welcome name=&quot;Edite&quot; /&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;);
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;App /&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/LYLEWNq?editors=0010">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/LYLEWNq?editors=0010</a></p>
<p>Typically, new React apps have a single <code>App</code> component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like <code>Button</code> and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.</p>
<h2 id="extracting-components">Extracting Components</h2>
<p>Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components.</p>
<p>For example, consider this <code>Comment</code> component:</p>
<pre><code>function Comment(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;Comment&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img className=&quot;Avatar&quot;src={props.author.avatarUrl}alt={props.author.name}/&gt;
        &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo-name&quot;&gt;
          {props.author.name}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-text&quot;&gt;
        {props.text}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-date&quot;&gt;
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/extracting-components"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/PojwpzP?editors=0010">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/PojwpzP?editors=0010</a></p>
<p>It accepts <code>author</code> (an object), <code>text</code> (a string), and <code>date</code> (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website.</p>
<p>This component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Let’s extract a few components from it.</p>
<p>First, we will extract <code>Avatar</code>:</p>
<pre><code>function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    &lt;img className=&quot;Avatar&quot;      src={props.user.avatarUrl}      alt={props.user.name}    /&gt;  );
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Avatar</code> doesn’t need to know that it is being rendered inside a <code>Comment</code>. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: <code>user</code> rather than <code>author</code>.</p>
<p>We recommend naming props from the component’s own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used.</p>
<p>We can now simplify <code>Comment</code> a tiny bit:</p>
<pre><code>function Comment(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;Comment&quot;&gt;      &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo&quot;&gt;        &lt;Avatar user={props.author} /&gt;        &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo-name&quot;&gt;          {props.author.name}
        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-text&quot;&gt;        {props.text}
      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-date&quot;&gt;        {formatDate(props.date)}
      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<p>Next, we will extract a <code>UserInfo</code> component that renders an <code>Avatar</code> next to the user’s name:</p>
<p><code>function UserInfo(props) { return ( &lt;div className="UserInfo"&gt; &lt;Avatar user={props.user} /&gt; &lt;div className="UserInfo-name"&gt; {props.user.name} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); }</code></p>
<p>This lets us simplify <code>Comment</code> even further:</p>
<pre><code>function Comment(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;Comment&quot;&gt;      &lt;UserInfo user={props.author} /&gt;      &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-text&quot;&gt;        {props.text}
      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-date&quot;&gt;        {formatDate(props.date)}
      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;);
}</code></pre>

<p>Extracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (<code>Button</code>, <code>Panel</code>, <code>Avatar</code>), or is complex enough on its own (<code>App</code>, <code>FeedStory</code>, <code>Comment</code>), it is a good candidate to be extracted to a separate component.</p>
<h2 id="props-are-read-only">Props are Read-Only</h2>
<p>Whether you declare a component <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components">as a function or a class</a>, it must never modify its own props. Consider this <code>sum</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}</code></pre>
<p>Such functions are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">"pure”</a> because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.</p>
<p>In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:</p>
<pre><code>function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}</code></pre>
<p>React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:</p>
<p><strong>All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">next section</a>, we will introduce a new concept of "state”. State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.</p>
<h2 id="state-and-lifecycle"><strong>State and Lifecycle</strong></h2>

<p>Consider the ticking clock example from <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#updating-the-rendered-element">one of the previous sections</a>. In <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom">Rendering Elements</a>, we have only learned one way to update the UI. We call <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> to change the rendered output:</p>
<pre><code>function tick() {
  const element = (
    &lt;div&gt;      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;);
  ReactDOM.render(    element,    document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)  );}

setInterval(tick, 1000);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gwoJZk?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p>In this section, we will learn how to make the <code>Clock</code> component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second.</p>
<p>We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:</p>
<pre><code>function Clock(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;  );
}

function tick() {
  ReactDOM.render(
    &lt;Clock date={new Date()} /&gt;,    document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/dpdoYR?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/powvegw?editors=0010">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/powvegw?editors=0010</a></p>
<p>However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the <code>Clock</code> sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the <code>Clock</code>.</p>
<p>Ideally we want to write this once and have the <code>Clock</code> update itself:</p>
<pre><code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Clock /&gt;,  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>
<p>To implement this, we need to add "state” to the <code>Clock</code> component.</p>
<p>State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.</p>
<h2 id="converting-a-function-to-a-class">Converting a Function to a Class</h2>
<p>You can convert a function component like <code>Clock</code> to a class in five steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">ES6 class</a>, with the same name, that extends <code>React.Component</code>.</li>
<li>Add a single empty method to it called <code>render()</code>.</li>
<li>Move the body of the function into the <code>render()</code> method.</li>
<li>Replace <code>props</code> with <code>this.props</code> in the <code>render()</code> body.</li>
<li>Delete the remaining empty function declaration.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {

      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;);

<p><code>Clock</code> is now defined as a class rather than a function.</p>
<p>The <code>render</code> method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render <code>&lt;Clock /&gt;</code> into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the <code>Clock</code> class will be used. This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.</p>
<h2 id="adding-local-state-to-a-class">Adding Local State to a Class</h2>
<p>We will move the <code>date</code> from props to state in three steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Replace <code>this.props.date</code> with <code>this.state.date</code> in the <code>render()</code> method:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor">class constructor</a> that assigns the initial <code>this.state</code>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Note how we pass <code>props</code> to the base constructor:</p>
<pre><code> constructor(props) {
    super(props);    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }</code></pre>
<p>Class components should always call the base constructor with <code>props</code>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Remove the <code>date</code> prop from the <code>&lt;Clock /&gt;</code> element:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Clock /&gt;,  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>
<p>We will later add the timer code back to the component itself.</p>
<p>The result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.state = {date: new Date()};  }render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;);
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Clock /&gt;,  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/oNwgZbV?editors=0010">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/oNwgZbV?editors=0010</a></p>
<p>Next, we’ll make the <code>Clock</code> set up its own timer and update itself every second.</p>
<h2 id="adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class">Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class</h2>
<p>In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.</p>
<p>We want to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval">set up a timer</a> whenever the <code>Clock</code> is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called "mounting” in React.</p>
<p>We also want to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/clearInterval">clear that timer</a> whenever the DOM produced by the <code>Clock</code> is removed. This is called "unmounting” in React.</p>
<p>We can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts:</p>
<pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {  }  componentWillUnmount() {  }render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>These methods are called "lifecycle methods”.</p>
<p>The <code>componentDidMount()</code> method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:</p>
<pre><code>  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(      () =&gt; this.tick(),      1000    );  }</code></pre>
<p>Note how we save the timer ID right on <code>this</code> (<code>this.timerID</code>).</p>
<p>While <code>this.props</code> is set up by React itself and <code>this.state</code> has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn’t participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).</p>
<p>We will tear down the timer in the <code>componentWillUnmount()</code> lifecycle method:</p>
<pre><code>  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);  }</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we will implement a method called <code>tick()</code> that the <code>Clock</code> component will run every second.</p>
<p>It will use <code>this.setState()</code> to schedule updates to the component local state:</p>
<pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () =&gt; this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {    this.setState({      date: new Date()    });  }render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;);
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Clock /&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/amqdNA?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p>Now the clock ticks every second.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly recap what’s going on and the order in which the methods are called:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>When <code>&lt;Clock /&gt;</code> is passed to <code>ReactDOM.render()</code>, React calls the constructor of the <code>Clock</code> component. Since <code>Clock</code> needs to display the current time, it initializes <code>this.state</code> with an object including the current time. We will later update this state.</li>
<li>React then calls the <code>Clock</code> component’s <code>render()</code> method. This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React then updates the DOM to match the <code>Clock</code>’s render output.</li>
<li>When the <code>Clock</code> output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the <code>componentDidMount()</code> lifecycle method. Inside it, the <code>Clock</code> component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component’s <code>tick()</code> method once a second.</li>
<li>Every second the browser calls the <code>tick()</code> method. Inside it, the <code>Clock</code> component schedules a UI update by calling <code>setState()</code> with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the <code>setState()</code> call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the <code>render()</code> method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, <code>this.state.date</code> in the <code>render()</code> method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly.</li>
<li>If the <code>Clock</code> component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the <code>componentWillUnmount()</code> lifecycle method so the timer is stopped.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="using-state-correctly">Using State Correctly</h2>
<p>There are three things you should know about <code>setState()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-modify-state-directly">Do Not Modify State Directly</h2>
<p>For example, this will not re-render a component:</p>
<pre><code>// Wrong
this.state.comment = &#39;Hello&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>Instead, use <code>setState()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// Correct
this.setState({comment: &#39;Hello&#39;});</code></pre>
<p>The only place where you can assign <code>this.state</code> is the constructor.</p>
<h2 id="state-updates-may-be-asynchronous">State Updates May Be Asynchronous</h2>
<p>React may batch multiple <code>setState()</code> calls into a single update for performance.</p>
<p>Because <code>this.props</code> and <code>this.state</code> may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.</p>
<p>For example, this code may fail to update the counter:</p>
<pre><code>// Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});</code></pre>
<p>To fix it, use a second form of <code>setState()</code> that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:</p>
<pre><code>// Correct
this.setState((state, props) =&gt; ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));</code></pre>
<p>We used an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow function</a> above, but it also works with regular functions:</p>
<pre><code>// Correct
this.setState(function(state, props) {
  return {
    counter: state.counter + props.increment
  };
});</code></pre>
<h2 id="state-updates-are-merged">State Updates are Merged</h2>
<p>When you call <code>setState()</code>, React merges the object you provide into the current state.</p>
<p>For example, your state may contain several independent variables:</p>
<pre><code>  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      posts: [],      comments: []    };
  }</code></pre>
<p>Then you can update them independently with separate <code>setState()</code> calls:</p>
<pre><code>  componentDidMount() {
    fetchPosts().then(response =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        posts: response.posts      });
    });

    fetchComments().then(response =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        comments: response.comments      });
    });
  }</code></pre>
<p>The merging is shallow, so <code>this.setState({comments})</code> leaves <code>this.state.posts</code> intact, but completely replaces <code>this.state.comments</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-flows-down">The Data Flows Down</h2>
<p>Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn’t care whether it is defined as a function or a class.</p>
<p>This is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.</p>
<p>A component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;FormattedDate date={this.state.date} /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>FormattedDate</code> component would receive the <code>date</code> in its props and wouldn’t know whether it came from the <code>Clock</code>’s state, from the <code>Clock</code>’s props, or was typed by hand:</p>
<pre><code>function FormattedDate(props) {
  return &lt;h2&gt;It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;;
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/zKRqNB?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/GREgWEp?editors=0010">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/GREgWEp?editors=0010</a></p>
<p>This is commonly called a "top-down” or "unidirectional” data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components "below” them in the tree.</p>
<p>If you imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each component’s state is like an additional water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down.</p>
<p>To show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an <code>App</code> component that renders three <code>&lt;Clock&gt;</code>s:</p>
<pre><code>function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;      &lt;Clock /&gt;      &lt;Clock /&gt;      &lt;Clock /&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;);
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;App /&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/YzQPZQK?editors=0010">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/YzQPZQK?editors=0010</a></p>
<p>Each <code>Clock</code> sets up its own timer and updates independently.</p>
<p>In React apps, whether a component is stateful or stateless is considered an implementation detail of the component that may change over time. You can use stateless components inside stateful components, and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="handling-events"><strong>Handling Events</strong></h2>
<h2 id="handling-events-with-react-elements-is-very-similar-to-handling-events-on-dom-elements.-there-are-some-syntax-differences">Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:</h2>
<ul>
<li>React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.</li>
<li>With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=&quot;activateLasers()&quot;&gt;
  Activate Lasers
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
<p>is slightly different in React:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;button onClick={activateLasers}&gt;  Activate Lasers
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Another difference is that you cannot return <code>false</code> to prevent default behavior in React. You must call <code>preventDefault</code> explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, you can write:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;form onsubmit=&quot;console.log(&#39;You clicked submit.&#39;); return false&quot;&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In React, this could instead be:</p>
<pre><code>function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();    console.log(&#39;You clicked submit.&#39;);
  }

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;/form&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>e</code> is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/">W3C spec</a>, so you don’t need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. React events do not work exactly the same as native events. See the <code>[SyntheticEvent](&lt;https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html&gt;)</code> reference guide to learn more.</p>
<p>When using React, you generally don’t need to call <code>addEventListener</code> to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.</p>
<p>When you define a component using an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">ES6 class</a>, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class. For example, this <code>Toggle</code> component renders a button that lets the user toggle between "ON” and "OFF” states:</p>
<pre><code>class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};

    // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);  }

  handleClick() {    this.setState(prevState =&gt; ({      isToggleOn: !prevState.isToggleOn    }));  }render() {
    return (
      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;        {this.state.isToggleOn ? &#39;ON&#39; : &#39;OFF&#39;}
      &lt;/button&gt;);
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Toggle /&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/xEmzGg?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p>You have to be careful about the meaning of <code>this</code> in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind">bound</a> by default. If you forget to bind <code>this.handleClick</code> and pass it to <code>onClick</code>, <code>this</code> will be <code>undefined</code> when the function is actually called.</p>
<p>This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/01/understanding-javascript-function-prototype-bind/">how functions work in JavaScript</a>. Generally, if you refer to a method without <code>()</code> after it, such as <code>onClick={this.handleClick}</code>, you should bind that method.</p>
<p>If calling <code>bind</code> annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/">public class fields syntax</a>, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks:</p>
<pre><code>class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick.  // Warning: this is *experimental* syntax.  handleClick = () =&gt; {    console.log(&#39;this is:&#39;, this);  }render() {
    return (
      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;        Click me
      &lt;/button&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>This syntax is enabled by default in <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">Create React App</a>.</p>
<p>If you aren’t using class fields syntax, you can use an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow function</a> in the callback:</p>
<pre><code>class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log(&#39;this is:&#39;, this);
  }

  render() {
    // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick    return (      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; this.handleClick()}&gt;        Click me
      &lt;/button&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the <code>LoggingButton</code> renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.</p>
<h2 id="passing-arguments-to-event-handlers">Passing Arguments to Event Handlers</h2>
<p>Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if <code>id</code> is the row ID, either of the following would work:</p>
<p><code>&lt;button onClick={(e) =&gt; this.deleteRow(id, e)}&gt;Delete Row&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}&gt;Delete Row&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
<p>The above two lines are equivalent, and use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions">arrow functions</a> and <code>[Function.prototype.bind](&lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind&gt;)</code> respectively.</p>
<p>In both cases, the <code>e</code> argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with <code>bind</code> any further arguments are automatically forwarded.</p>
<h2 id="conditional-rendering"><strong>Conditional Rendering</strong></h2>
<h2 id="in-react-you-can-create-distinct-components-that-encapsulate-behavior-you-need.-then-you-can-render-only-some-of-them-depending-on-the-state-of-your-application.">In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.</h2>
<p>Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like <code>[if](&lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else&gt;)</code> or the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator">conditional operator</a> to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.</p>
<p>Consider these two components:</p>
<pre><code>function UserGreeting(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Welcome back!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

function GuestGreeting(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Please sign up.&lt;/h1&gt;;
}</code></pre>
<p>We’ll create a <code>Greeting</code> component that displays either of these components depending on whether a user is logged in:</p>
<pre><code>function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  if (isLoggedIn) {    return &lt;UserGreeting /&gt;;  }  return &lt;GuestGreeting /&gt;;}
ReactDOM.render(
  // Try changing to isLoggedIn={true}:
  &lt;Greeting isLoggedIn={false} /&gt;,  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;));</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/mdwyWmJ?editors=0011">https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/mdwyWmJ?editors=0011</a></p>
<p>This example renders a different greeting depending on the value of <code>isLoggedIn</code> prop.</p>
<h2 id="element-variables">Element Variables</h2>
<p>You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn’t change.</p>
<p>Consider these two new components representing Logout and Login buttons:</p>
<pre><code>function LoginButton(props) {
  return (
    &lt;button onClick={props.onClick}&gt;
      Login
    &lt;/button&gt;);
}

function LogoutButton(props) {
  return (
    &lt;button onClick={props.onClick}&gt;
      Logout
    &lt;/button&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<p>In the example below, we will create a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class">stateful component</a> called <code>LoginControl</code>.</p>
<p>It will render either <code>&lt;LoginButton /&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;LogoutButton /&gt;</code> depending on its current state. It will also render a <code>&lt;Greeting /&gt;</code> from the previous example:</p>
<pre><code>class LoginControl extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleLoginClick = this.handleLoginClick.bind(this);
    this.handleLogoutClick = this.handleLogoutClick.bind(this);
    this.state = {isLoggedIn: false};
  }

  handleLoginClick() {
    this.setState({isLoggedIn: true});
  }

  handleLogoutClick() {
    this.setState({isLoggedIn: false});
  }

  render() {
    const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
    let button;
    if (isLoggedIn) {      button = &lt;LogoutButton onClick={this.handleLogoutClick} /&gt;;    } else {      button = &lt;LoginButton onClick={this.handleLoginClick} /&gt;;    }return (
      &lt;div&gt;        &lt;Greeting isLoggedIn={isLoggedIn} /&gt;        {button}      &lt;/div&gt;);
  }
}

  &lt;LoginControl /&gt;,

);</code></pre>

<p>While declaring a variable and using an <code>if</code> statement is a fine way to conditionally render a component, sometimes you might want to use a shorter syntax. There are a few ways to inline conditions in JSX, explained below.</p>
<h2 id="inline-if-with-logical-operator">Inline If with Logical &amp;&amp; Operator</h2>
<p>You may <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx">embed expressions in JSX</a> by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator. It can be handy for conditionally including an element:</p>
<pre><code>function Mailbox(props) {
  const unreadMessages = props.unreadMessages;
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;      &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;      {unreadMessages.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp;        &lt;h2&gt;          You have {unreadMessages.length} unread messages.        &lt;/h2&gt;      }    &lt;/div&gt;);
}

const messages = [&#39;React&#39;, &#39;Re: React&#39;, &#39;Re:Re: React&#39;];

<p>It works because in JavaScript, <code>true &amp;&amp; expression</code> always evaluates to <code>expression</code>, and <code>false &amp;&amp; expression</code> always evaluates to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the condition is <code>true</code>, the element right after <code>&amp;&amp;</code> will appear in the output. If it is <code>false</code>, React will ignore and skip it.</p>
<p>Note that returning a falsy expression will still cause the element after <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to be skipped but will return the falsy expression. In the example below, <code>&lt;div&gt;0&lt;/div&gt;</code> will be returned by the render method.</p>
<pre><code>render() {
  const count = 0;  return (
    &lt;div&gt;      { count &amp;&amp; &lt;h1&gt;Messages: {count}&lt;/h1&gt;}    &lt;/div&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="inline-if-else-with-conditional-operator">Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator</h2>
<p>Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator <code>[condition ? true : false](&lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator&gt;)</code>.</p>
<p>In the example below, we use it to conditionally render a small block of text.</p>
<pre><code>render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;      The user is &lt;b&gt;{isLoggedIn ? &#39;currently&#39; : &#39;not&#39;}&lt;/b&gt; logged in.    &lt;/div&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<p>It can also be used for larger expressions although it is less obvious what’s going on:</p>
<pre><code>render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;      {isLoggedIn        ? &lt;LogoutButton onClick={this.handleLogoutClick} /&gt;        : &lt;LoginButton onClick={this.handleLoginClick} /&gt;      }
    &lt;/div&gt;  );
}</code></pre>
<p>Just like in JavaScript, it is up to you to choose an appropriate style based on what you and your team consider more readable. Also remember that whenever conditions become too complex, it might be a good time to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components">extract a component</a>.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-component-from-rendering">Preventing Component from Rendering</h2>
<p>In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return <code>null</code> instead of its render output.</p>
<p>In the example below, the <code>&lt;WarningBanner /&gt;</code> is rendered depending on the value of the prop called <code>warn</code>. If the value of the prop is <code>false</code>, then the component does not render:</p>
<pre><code>function WarningBanner(props) {
  if (!props.warn) {    return null;  }return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;      Warning!
    &lt;/div&gt;);
}

class Page extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {showWarning: true};
    this.handleToggleClick = this.handleToggleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleToggleClick() {
    this.setState(state =&gt; ({
      showWarning: !state.showWarning
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;        &lt;WarningBanner warn={this.state.showWarning} /&gt;        &lt;button onClick={this.handleToggleClick}&gt;          {this.state.showWarning ? &#39;Hide&#39; : &#39;Show&#39;}
        &lt;/button&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;);
  }
}

<h2 id="lists-and-keys"><strong>Lists and Keys</strong></h2>
<h2 id="first-lets-review-how-you-transform-lists-in-javascript.">First, let’s review how you transform lists in JavaScript.</h2>
<p>Given the code below, we use the <code>[map()](&lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map&gt;)</code> function to take an array of <code>numbers</code> and double their values. We assign the new array returned by <code>map()</code> to the variable <code>doubled</code> and log it:</p>
<pre><code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) =&gt; number * 2);console.log(doubled);</code></pre>
<p>This code logs <code>[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code> to the console.</p>
<p>In React, transforming arrays into lists of <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html">elements</a> is nearly identical.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-multiple-components">Rendering Multiple Components</h2>
<p>You can build collections of elements and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx">include them in JSX</a> using curly braces <code>{}</code>.</p>
<p>Below, we loop through the <code>numbers</code> array using the JavaScript <code>[map()](&lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map&gt;)</code> function. We return a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to <code>listItems</code>:</p>
<pre><code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt;  &lt;li&gt;{number}&lt;/li&gt;);</code></pre>
<p>We include the entire <code>listItems</code> array inside a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element, and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom">render it to the DOM</a>:</p>
<pre><code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;ul&gt;{listItems}&lt;/ul&gt;,  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>

<p>This code displays a bullet list of numbers between 1 and 5.</p>
<h2 id="basic-list-component">Basic List Component</h2>
<p>Usually you would render lists inside a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html">component</a>.</p>
<p>We can refactor the previous example into a component that accepts an array of <code>numbers</code> and outputs a list of elements.</p>
<pre><code>function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt;    &lt;li&gt;{number}&lt;/li&gt;  );  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;{listItems}&lt;/ul&gt;  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;NumberList numbers={numbers} /&gt;,  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>
<p>When you run this code, you’ll be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items. A "key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. We’ll discuss why it’s important in the next section.</p>
<p>Let’s assign a <code>key</code> to our list items inside <code>numbers.map()</code> and fix the missing key issue.</p>
<pre><code>function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt;
    &lt;li key={number.toString()}&gt;      {number}
    &lt;/li&gt;);
  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;{listItems}&lt;/ul&gt;);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;NumberList numbers={numbers} /&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>

<h2 id="keys">Keys</h2>
<p>Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:</p>
<pre><code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt;
  &lt;li key={number.toString()}&gt;    {number}
  &lt;/li&gt;);</code></pre>
<p>The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:</p>
<pre><code>const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =&gt;
  &lt;li key={todo.id}&gt;    {todo.text}
  &lt;/li&gt;);</code></pre>
<p>When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:</p>
<pre><code>const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =&gt;
  // Only do this if items have no stable IDs  &lt;li key={index}&gt;    {todo.text}
  &lt;/li&gt;);</code></pre>
<p>We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. Check out Robin Pokorny’s article for an <a href="https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318">in-depth explanation on the negative impacts of using an index as a key</a>. If you choose not to assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#recursing-on-children">in-depth explanation about why keys are necessary</a> if you’re interested in learning more.</p>
<h2 id="extracting-components-with-keys">Extracting Components with Keys</h2>
<p>Keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array.</p>
<p>For example, if you <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components">extract</a> a <code>ListItem</code> component, you should keep the key on the <code>&lt;ListItem /&gt;</code> elements in the array rather than on the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element in the <code>ListItem</code> itself.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Incorrect Key Usage</strong></p>
<pre><code>function ListItem(props) {
  const value = props.value;
  return (
    // Wrong! There is no need to specify the key here:    &lt;li key={value.toString()}&gt;      {value}
    &lt;/li&gt;);
}

function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt;
    // Wrong! The key should have been specified here:    &lt;ListItem value={number} /&gt;  );
  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;      {listItems}
    &lt;/ul&gt;);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;NumberList numbers={numbers} /&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example: Correct Key Usage</strong></p>
<pre><code>function ListItem(props) {
  // Correct! There is no need to specify the key here:  return &lt;li&gt;{props.value}&lt;/li&gt;;}

function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt;
    // Correct! Key should be specified inside the array.    &lt;ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} /&gt;  );
  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;      {listItems}
    &lt;/ul&gt;);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;NumberList numbers={numbers} /&gt;,

);</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ZXeOGM?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the <code>map()</code> call need keys.</p>
<h2 id="keys-must-only-be-unique-among-siblings">Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings</h2>
<p>Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However, they don’t need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays:</p>
<pre><code>function Blog(props) {
  const sidebar = (    &lt;ul&gt;      {props.posts.map((post) =&gt;
        &lt;li key={post.id}&gt;          {post.title}
        &lt;/li&gt;)}
    &lt;/ul&gt;);
  const content = props.posts.map((post) =&gt;    &lt;div key={post.id}&gt;      &lt;h3&gt;{post.title}&lt;/h3&gt;      &lt;p&gt;{post.content}&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;);
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;      {sidebar}      &lt;hr /&gt;      {content}    &lt;/div&gt;);
}

const posts = [
  {id: 1, title: &#39;Hello World&#39;, content: &#39;Welcome to learning React!&#39;},
  {id: 2, title: &#39;Installation&#39;, content: &#39;You can install React from npm.&#39;}
];
ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Blog posts={posts} /&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>

<p>{% embed url="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/mdwyWWy?editors=0010” %}</p>
<p>Keys serve as a hint to React but they don’t get passed to your components. If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name:</p>
<pre><code>const content = posts.map((post) =&gt;
  &lt;Post    key={post.id}    id={post.id}    title={post.title} /&gt;);</code></pre>
<p>With the example above, the <code>Post</code> component can read <code>props.id</code>, but not <code>props.key</code>.</p>
<h2 id="embedding-map-in-jsx">Embedding map() in JSX</h2>
<p>In the examples above we declared a separate <code>listItems</code> variable and included it in JSX:</p>
<pre><code>function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt;    &lt;ListItem key={number.toString()}              value={number} /&gt;  );  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;      {listItems}
    &lt;/ul&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<p>JSX allows <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx">embedding any expression</a> in curly braces so we could inline the <code>map()</code> result:</p>
<pre><code>function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;      {numbers.map((number) =&gt;        &lt;ListItem key={number.toString()}                  value={number} /&gt;      )}    &lt;/ul&gt;);
}</code></pre>

<p>{% embed url="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/JjJoWEw?editors=0010” %}</p>
<p>Sometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused. Like in JavaScript, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability. Keep in mind that if the <code>map()</code> body is too nested, it might be a good time to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components">extract a component</a>.</p>
<h2 id="forms"><strong>Forms</strong></h2>
<h2 id="html-form-elements-work-a-bit-differently-from-other-dom-elements-in-react-because-form-elements-naturally-keep-some-internal-state.-for-example-this-form-in-plain-html-accepts-a-single-name">HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name:</h2>
<pre><code>&lt;form&gt;&lt;label&gt;
    Name:
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called "controlled components”.</p>
<h2 id="controlled-components">Controlled Components</h2>
<p>In HTML, form elements such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with <code>[setState()](&lt;https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate&gt;)</code>.</p>
<p>We can combine the two by making the React state be the "single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a "controlled component”.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to make the previous example log the name when it is submitted, we can write the form as a controlled component:</p>
<pre><code>class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: &#39;&#39;};this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {    this.setState({value: event.target.value});  }handleSubmit(event) {
    alert(&#39;A name was submitted: &#39; + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}&gt;        &lt;label&gt;          Name:
          &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} /&gt;        &lt;/label&gt;        &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;      &lt;/form&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/VmmPgp?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p>{% embed url="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/rNwayjv?editors=0010” %}</p>
<p>Since the <code>value</code> attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be <code>this.state.value</code>, making the React state the source of truth. Since <code>handleChange</code> runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.</p>
<p>With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.</p>
<h2 id="the-textarea-tag">The textarea Tag</h2>
<p>In HTML, a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> element defines its text by its children:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;textarea&gt;
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area
&lt;/textarea&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In React, a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> uses a <code>value</code> attribute instead. This way, a form using a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input:</p>
<pre><code>class EssayForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {      value: &#39;Please write an essay about your favorite DOM element.&#39;    };this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {    this.setState({value: event.target.value});  }handleSubmit(event) {
    alert(&#39;An essay was submitted: &#39; + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}&gt;        &lt;label&gt;          Essay:
          &lt;textarea value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} /&gt;        &lt;/label&gt;        &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;      &lt;/form&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code>this.state.value</code> is initialized in the constructor, so that the text area starts off with some text in it.</p>
<h2 id="the-select-tag">The select Tag</h2>
<p>In HTML, <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors:</p>
<p><code>&lt;select&gt;&lt;option value="grapefruit"&gt;Grapefruit&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value="lime"&gt;Lime&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option selected value="coconut"&gt;Coconut&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option value="mango"&gt;Mango&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;</code></p>
<p>Note that the Coconut option is initially selected, because of the <code>selected</code> attribute. React, instead of using this <code>selected</code> attribute, uses a <code>value</code> attribute on the root <code>select</code> tag. This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to update it in one place. For example:</p>
<pre><code>class FlavorForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: &#39;coconut&#39;};this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {    this.setState({value: event.target.value});  }handleSubmit(event) {
    alert(&#39;Your favorite flavor is: &#39; + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}&gt;        &lt;label&gt;          Pick your favorite flavor:
          &lt;select value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange}&gt;            &lt;option value=&quot;grapefruit&quot;&gt;Grapefruit&lt;/option&gt;            &lt;option value=&quot;lime&quot;&gt;Lime&lt;/option&gt;            &lt;option value=&quot;coconut&quot;&gt;Coconut&lt;/option&gt;            &lt;option value=&quot;mango&quot;&gt;Mango&lt;/option&gt;          &lt;/select&gt;        &lt;/label&gt;        &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; /&gt;      &lt;/form&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>{% embed url="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/JbbEzX?editors=0010” %}</p>
<p>Overall, this makes it so that <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> all work very similarly - they all accept a <code>value</code> attribute that you can use to implement a controlled component.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NoteYou can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag:&lt;select multiple={true} value={[‘B’, ‘C’]}&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-file-input-tag">The file input Tag</h2>
<p>In HTML, an <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code> lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications">File API</a>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;input type="file" /&gt;</code></p>
<p>Because its value is read-only, it is an <strong>uncontrolled</strong> component in React. It is discussed together with other uncontrolled components <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html#the-file-input-tag">later in the documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="handling-multiple-inputs">Handling Multiple Inputs</h2>
<p>When you need to handle multiple controlled <code>input</code> elements, you can add a <code>name</code> attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of <code>event.target.name</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>class Reservation extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      isGoing: true,
      numberOfGuests: 2
    };

    this.handleInputChange = this.handleInputChange.bind(this);
  }

  handleInputChange(event) {
    const target = event.target;
    const value = target.type === &#39;checkbox&#39; ? target.checked : target.value;
    const name = target.name;this.setState({
      [name]: value    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;form&gt;        &lt;label&gt;          Is going:
          &lt;input
            name=&quot;isGoing&quot;            type=&quot;checkbox&quot;checked={this.state.isGoing}onChange={this.handleInputChange} /&gt;        &lt;/label&gt;        &lt;br /&gt;        &lt;label&gt;          Number of guests:
          &lt;input
            name=&quot;numberOfGuests&quot;            type=&quot;number&quot;value={this.state.numberOfGuests}onChange={this.handleInputChange} /&gt;        &lt;/label&gt;      &lt;/form&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>Note how we used the ES6 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#Computed_property_names">computed property name</a> syntax to update the state key corresponding to the given input name:</p>
<pre><code>this.setState({
  [name]: value});</code></pre>
<p>It is equivalent to this ES5 code:</p>
<pre><code>var partialState = {};
partialState[name] = value;this.setState(partialState);</code></pre>
<p>Also, since <code>setState()</code> automatically <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-are-merged">merges a partial state into the current state</a>, we only needed to call it with the changed parts.</p>
<h2 id="controlled-input-null-value">Controlled Input Null Value</h2>
<p>Specifying the value prop on a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components">controlled component</a> prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If you’ve specified a <code>value</code> but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set <code>value</code> to <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>The following code demonstrates this. (The input is locked at first but becomes editable after a short delay.)</p>
<pre><code>ReactDOM.render(&lt;input value=&quot;hi&quot; /&gt;, mountNode);

setTimeout(function() {
  ReactDOM.render(&lt;input value={null} /&gt;, mountNode);
}, 1000);</code></pre>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-controlled-components">Alternatives to Controlled Components</h2>
<p>It can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to check out <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html">uncontrolled components</a>, an alternative technique for implementing input forms.</p>
<h2 id="fully-fledged-solutions">Fully-Fledged Solutions</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a complete solution including validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission, <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/formik">Formik</a> is one of the popular choices. However, it is built on the same principles of controlled components and managing state — so don’t neglect to learn them.</p>
<h2 id="lifting-state-up"><strong>Lifting State Up</strong></h2>
<h2 id="often-several-components-need-to-reflect-the-same-changing-data.-we-recommend-lifting-the-shared-state-up-to-their-closest-common-ancestor.-lets-see-how-this-works-in-action.">Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. Let’s see how this works in action.</h2>
<p>In this section, we will create a temperature calculator that calculates whether the water would boil at a given temperature.</p>
<p>We will start with a component called <code>BoilingVerdict</code>. It accepts the <code>celsius</code> temperature as a prop, and prints whether it is enough to boil the water:</p>
<pre><code>function BoilingVerdict(props) {
  if (props.celsius &gt;= 100) {
    return &lt;p&gt;The water would boil.&lt;/p&gt;;  }
  return &lt;p&gt;The water would not boil.&lt;/p&gt;;}</code></pre>
<p>Next, we will create a component called <code>Calculator</code>. It renders an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> that lets you enter the temperature, and keeps its value in <code>this.state.temperature</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it renders the <code>BoilingVerdict</code> for the current input value.</p>
<pre><code>class Calculator extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {temperature: &#39;&#39;};  }

  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});  }

  render() {
    const temperature = this.state.temperature;    return (
      &lt;fieldset&gt;        &lt;legend&gt;Enter temperature in Celsius:&lt;/legend&gt;        &lt;input          value={temperature}          onChange={this.handleChange} /&gt;        &lt;BoilingVerdict          celsius={parseFloat(temperature)} /&gt;      &lt;/fieldset&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="adding-a-second-input">Adding a Second Input</h2>
<p>Our new requirement is that, in addition to a Celsius input, we provide a Fahrenheit input, and they are kept in sync.</p>
<p>We can start by extracting a <code>TemperatureInput</code> component from <code>Calculator</code>. We will add a new <code>scale</code> prop to it that can either be <code>"c"</code> or <code>"f"</code>:</p>
<pre><code>const scaleNames = {  c: &#39;Celsius&#39;,  f: &#39;Fahrenheit&#39;};class TemperatureInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {temperature: &#39;&#39;};
  }

  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
  }

  render() {
    const temperature = this.state.temperature;
    const scale = this.props.scale;    return (
      &lt;fieldset&gt;        &lt;legend&gt;Enter temperature in {scaleNames[scale]}:&lt;/legend&gt;        &lt;input value={temperature}onChange={this.handleChange} /&gt;      &lt;/fieldset&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>We can now change the <code>Calculator</code> to render two separate temperature inputs:</p>
<pre><code>class Calculator extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;        &lt;TemperatureInput scale=&quot;c&quot; /&gt;        &lt;TemperatureInput scale=&quot;f&quot; /&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/jGBryx?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p>{% embed url="https://codepen.io/bgoonz/pen/QWgwpGv?editors=0010” %}</p>
<p>We have two inputs now, but when you enter the temperature in one of them, the other doesn’t update. This contradicts our requirement: we want to keep them in sync.</p>
<p>We also can’t display the <code>BoilingVerdict</code> from <code>Calculator</code>. The <code>Calculator</code> doesn’t know the current temperature because it is hidden inside the <code>TemperatureInput</code>.</p>
<h2 id="writing-conversion-functions">Writing Conversion Functions</h2>
<p>First, we will write two functions to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and back:</p>
<pre><code>function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
}

function toFahrenheit(celsius) {
  return (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
}</code></pre>
<p>These two functions convert numbers. We will write another function that takes a string <code>temperature</code> and a converter function as arguments and returns a string. We will use it to calculate the value of one input based on the other input.</p>
<p>It returns an empty string on an invalid <code>temperature</code>, and it keeps the output rounded to the third decimal place:</p>
<pre><code>function tryConvert(temperature, convert) {
  const input = parseFloat(temperature);
  if (Number.isNaN(input)) {
    return &#39;&#39;;
  }
  const output = convert(input);
  const rounded = Math.round(output * 1000) / 1000;
  return rounded.toString();
}</code></pre>
<p>For example, <code>tryConvert('abc', toCelsius)</code> returns an empty string, and <code>tryConvert('10.22', toFahrenheit)</code> returns <code>'50.396'</code>.</p>
<h2 id="lifting-state-up-1">Lifting State Up</h2>
<p>Currently, both <code>TemperatureInput</code> components independently keep their values in the local state:</p>
<pre><code>class TemperatureInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {temperature: &#39;&#39;};  }

  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});  }

  render() {
    const temperature = this.state.temperature;    // ...</code></pre>
<p>However, we want these two inputs to be in sync with each other. When we update the Celsius input, the Fahrenheit input should reflect the converted temperature, and vice versa.</p>
<p>In React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called "lifting state up”. We will remove the local state from the <code>TemperatureInput</code> and move it into the <code>Calculator</code> instead.</p>
<p>If the <code>Calculator</code> owns the shared state, it becomes the "source of truth” for the current temperature in both inputs. It can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other. Since the props of both <code>TemperatureInput</code> components are coming from the same parent <code>Calculator</code> component, the two inputs will always be in sync.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this works step by step.</p>
<p>First, we will replace <code>this.state.temperature</code> with <code>this.props.temperature</code> in the <code>TemperatureInput</code> component. For now, let’s pretend <code>this.props.temperature</code> already exists, although we will need to pass it from the <code>Calculator</code> in the future:</p>
<pre><code>  render() {
    // Before: const temperature = this.state.temperature;
    const temperature = this.props.temperature;    // ...</code></pre>
<p>We know that <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#props-are-read-only">props are read-only</a>. When the <code>temperature</code> was in the local state, the <code>TemperatureInput</code> could just call <code>this.setState()</code> to change it. However, now that the <code>temperature</code> is coming from the parent as a prop, the <code>TemperatureInput</code> has no control over it.</p>
<p>In React, this is usually solved by making a component "controlled”. Just like the DOM <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> accepts both a <code>value</code> and an <code>onChange</code> prop, so can the custom <code>TemperatureInput</code> accept both <code>temperature</code> and <code>onTemperatureChange</code> props from its parent <code>Calculator</code>.</p>
<p>Now, when the <code>TemperatureInput</code> wants to update its temperature, it calls <code>this.props.onTemperatureChange</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  handleChange(e) {
    // Before: this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
    this.props.onTemperatureChange(e.target.value);    // ...</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note:There is no special meaning to either temperature or onTemperatureChange prop names in custom components. We could have called them anything else, like name them value and onChange which is a common convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>onTemperatureChange</code> prop will be provided together with the <code>temperature</code> prop by the parent <code>Calculator</code> component. It will handle the change by modifying its own local state, thus re-rendering both inputs with the new values. We will look at the new <code>Calculator</code> implementation very soon.</p>
<p>Before diving into the changes in the <code>Calculator</code>, let’s recap our changes to the <code>TemperatureInput</code> component. We have removed the local state from it, and instead of reading <code>this.state.temperature</code>, we now read <code>this.props.temperature</code>. Instead of calling <code>this.setState()</code> when we want to make a change, we now call <code>this.props.onTemperatureChange()</code>, which will be provided by the <code>Calculator</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class TemperatureInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(e) {
    this.props.onTemperatureChange(e.target.value);  }

  render() {
    const temperature = this.props.temperature;    const scale = this.props.scale;
    return (
      &lt;fieldset&gt;        &lt;legend&gt;Enter temperature in {scaleNames[scale]}:&lt;/legend&gt;        &lt;input value={temperature}onChange={this.handleChange} /&gt;      &lt;/fieldset&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s turn to the <code>Calculator</code> component.</p>
<p>We will store the current input’s <code>temperature</code> and <code>scale</code> in its local state. This is the state we "lifted up” from the inputs, and it will serve as the "source of truth” for both of them. It is the minimal representation of all the data we need to know in order to render both inputs.</p>
<p>For example, if we enter 37 into the Celsius input, the state of the <code>Calculator</code> component will be:</p>
<pre><code>{
  temperature: &#39;37&#39;,
  scale: &#39;c&#39;
}</code></pre>
<p>If we later edit the Fahrenheit field to be 212, the state of the <code>Calculator</code> will be:</p>
<pre><code>{
  temperature: &#39;212&#39;,
  scale: &#39;f&#39;
}</code></pre>
<p>We could have stored the value of both inputs but it turns out to be unnecessary. It is enough to store the value of the most recently changed input, and the scale that it represents. We can then infer the value of the other input based on the current <code>temperature</code> and <code>scale</code> alone.</p>
<p>The inputs stay in sync because their values are computed from the same state:</p>
<pre><code>class Calculator extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleCelsiusChange = this.handleCelsiusChange.bind(this);
    this.handleFahrenheitChange = this.handleFahrenheitChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {temperature: &#39;&#39;, scale: &#39;c&#39;};  }

  handleCelsiusChange(temperature) {
    this.setState({scale: &#39;c&#39;, temperature});  }

  handleFahrenheitChange(temperature) {
    this.setState({scale: &#39;f&#39;, temperature});  }

  render() {
    const scale = this.state.scale;    const temperature = this.state.temperature;    const celsius = scale === &#39;f&#39; ? tryConvert(temperature, toCelsius) : temperature;    const fahrenheit = scale === &#39;c&#39; ? tryConvert(temperature, toFahrenheit) : temperature;return (
      &lt;div&gt;        &lt;TemperatureInputscale=&quot;c&quot;          temperature={celsius}          onTemperatureChange={this.handleCelsiusChange} /&gt;        &lt;TemperatureInputscale=&quot;f&quot;          temperature={fahrenheit}          onTemperatureChange={this.handleFahrenheitChange} /&gt;        &lt;BoilingVerdict          celsius={parseFloat(celsius)} /&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;);
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>{% embed url="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/WZpxpz?editors=0010” %}</p>
<p>Now, no matter which input you edit, <code>this.state.temperature</code> and <code>this.state.scale</code> in the <code>Calculator</code> get updated. One of the inputs gets the value as is, so any user input is preserved, and the other input value is always recalculated based on it.</p>
<p>Let’s recap what happens when you edit an input:</p>
<ul>
<li>React calls the function specified as <code>onChange</code> on the DOM <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. In our case, this is the <code>handleChange</code> method in the <code>TemperatureInput</code> component.</li>
<li>The <code>handleChange</code> method in the <code>TemperatureInput</code> component calls <code>this.props.onTemperatureChange()</code> with the new desired value. Its props, including <code>onTemperatureChange</code>, were provided by its parent component, the <code>Calculator</code>.</li>
<li>When it previously rendered, the <code>Calculator</code> had specified that <code>onTemperatureChange</code> of the Celsius <code>TemperatureInput</code> is the <code>Calculator</code>’s <code>handleCelsiusChange</code> method, and <code>onTemperatureChange</code> of the Fahrenheit <code>TemperatureInput</code> is the <code>Calculator</code>’s <code>handleFahrenheitChange</code> method. So either of these two <code>Calculator</code> methods gets called depending on which input we edited.</li>
<li>Inside these methods, the <code>Calculator</code> component asks React to re-render itself by calling <code>this.setState()</code> with the new input value and the current scale of the input we just edited.</li>
<li>React calls the <code>Calculator</code> component’s <code>render</code> method to learn what the UI should look like. The values of both inputs are recomputed based on the current temperature and the active scale. The temperature conversion is performed here.</li>
<li>React calls the <code>render</code> methods of the individual <code>TemperatureInput</code> components with their new props specified by the <code>Calculator</code>. It learns what their UI should look like.</li>
<li>React calls the <code>render</code> method of the <code>BoilingVerdict</code> component, passing the temperature in Celsius as its props.</li>
<li>React DOM updates the DOM with the boiling verdict and to match the desired input values. The input we just edited receives its current value, and the other input is updated to the temperature after conversion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every update goes through the same steps so the inputs stay in sync.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>There should be a single "source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application. Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#the-data-flows-down">top-down data flow</a>.</p>
<p>Lifting state involves writing more "boilerplate” code than two-way binding approaches, but as a benefit, it takes less work to find and isolate bugs. Since any state "lives” in some component and that component alone can change it, the surface area for bugs is greatly reduced. Additionally, you can implement any custom logic to reject or transform user input.</p>
<p>If something can be derived from either props or state, it probably shouldn’t be in the state. For example, instead of storing both <code>celsiusValue</code> and <code>fahrenheitValue</code>, we store just the last edited <code>temperature</code> and its <code>scale</code>. The value of the other input can always be calculated from them in the <code>render()</code> method. This lets us clear or apply rounding to the other field without losing any precision in the user input.</p>
<p>When you see something wrong in the UI, you can use <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools">React Developer Tools</a> to inspect the props and move up the tree until you find the component responsible for updating the state. This lets you trace the bugs to their source:</p>

<h2 id="composition-vs-inheritance"><strong>Composition vs Inheritance</strong></h2>
<h2 id="react-has-a-powerful-composition-model-and-we-recommend-using-composition-instead-of-inheritance-to-reuse-code-between-components.">React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.</h2>
<p>In this section, we will consider a few problems where developers new to React often reach for inheritance, and show how we can solve them with composition.</p>
<h2 id="containment">Containment</h2>
<p>Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. This is especially common for components like <code>Sidebar</code> or <code>Dialog</code> that represent generic "boxes”.</p>
<p>We recommend that such components use the special <code>children</code> prop to pass children elements directly into their output:</p>
<pre><code>function FancyBorder(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div className={&#39;FancyBorder FancyBorder-&#39; + props.color}&gt;      {props.children}    &lt;/div&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<p>This lets other components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX:</p>
<pre><code>function WelcomeDialog() {
  return (
    &lt;FancyBorder color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;      &lt;h1 className=&quot;Dialog-title&quot;&gt;        Welcome      &lt;/h1&gt;      &lt;p className=&quot;Dialog-message&quot;&gt;        Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!      &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/FancyBorder&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ozqNOV?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p>{% embed url="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ozqNOV?editors=0010” %}</p>
<p>Anything inside the <code>&lt;FancyBorder&gt;</code> JSX tag gets passed into the <code>FancyBorder</code> component as a <code>children</code> prop. Since <code>FancyBorder</code> renders <code>{props.children}</code> inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, the passed elements appear in the final output.</p>
<p>While this is less common, sometimes you might need multiple "holes” in a component. In such cases you may come up with your own convention instead of using <code>children</code>:</p>
<pre><code>function SplitPane(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div className=&quot;SplitPane&quot;&gt;      &lt;div className=&quot;SplitPane-left&quot;&gt;        {props.left}      &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div className=&quot;SplitPane-right&quot;&gt;        {props.right}      &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;);
}

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;SplitPaneleft={
        &lt;Contacts /&gt;      }right={
        &lt;Chat /&gt;      } /&gt;);
}</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gwZOJp?editors=0010"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>
<p>{% embed url="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gwZOJp?editors=0010” %}</p>
<p>React elements like <code>&lt;Contacts /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Chat /&gt;</code> are just objects, so you can pass them as props like any other data. This approach may remind you of "slots” in other libraries but there are no limitations on what you can pass as props in React.</p>
<h2 id="specialization">Specialization</h2>
<p>Sometimes we think about components as being "special cases” of other components. For example, we might say that a <code>WelcomeDialog</code> is a special case of <code>Dialog</code>.</p>
<p>In React, this is also achieved by composition, where a more "specific” component renders a more "generic” one and configures it with props:</p>
<pre><code>function Dialog(props) {
  return (
    &lt;FancyBorder color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;      &lt;h1 className=&quot;Dialog-title&quot;&gt;        {props.title}      &lt;/h1&gt;      &lt;p className=&quot;Dialog-message&quot;&gt;        {props.message}      &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/FancyBorder&gt;);
}

function WelcomeDialog() {
  return (
    &lt;Dialog      title=&quot;Welcome&quot;      message=&quot;Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!&quot; /&gt;  );
}</code></pre>

<p>{% embed url="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/kkEaOZ?editors=0010” %}</p>
<p>Composition works equally well for components defined as classes:</p>
<pre><code>function Dialog(props) {
  return (
    &lt;FancyBorder color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;      &lt;h1 className=&quot;Dialog-title&quot;&gt;        {props.title}
      &lt;/h1&gt;      &lt;p className=&quot;Dialog-message&quot;&gt;        {props.message}
      &lt;/p&gt;      {props.children}    &lt;/FancyBorder&gt;);
}

class SignUpDialog extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSignUp = this.handleSignUp.bind(this);
    this.state = {login: &#39;&#39;};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;Dialog title=&quot;Mars Exploration Program&quot;message=&quot;How should we refer to you?&quot;&gt;        &lt;input value={this.state.login}               onChange={this.handleChange} /&gt;        &lt;button onClick={this.handleSignUp}&gt;          Sign Me Up!        &lt;/button&gt;      &lt;/Dialog&gt;);
  }

  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({login: e.target.value});

<h2 id="so-what-about-inheritance">So What About Inheritance?</h2>
<p>At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.</p>
<p>Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.</p>
<p>If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.</p>

It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram.</h2>
<p>One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document, we’ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.</p>
<h2 id="start-with-a-mock">Start With A Mock</h2>
<p>Imagine that we already have a JSON API and a mock from our designer. The mock looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://reactjs.org/static/1071fbcc9eed01fddc115b41e193ec11/d4770/thinking-in-react-mock.png" alt="https://reactjs.org/static/1071fbcc9eed01fddc115b41e193ec11/d4770/thinking-in-react-mock.png" /><figcaption>https://reactjs.org/static/1071fbcc9eed01fddc115b41e193ec11/d4770/thinking-in-react-mock.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our JSON API returns some data that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
  {category: &quot;Sporting Goods&quot;, price: &quot;$49.99&quot;, stocked: true, name: &quot;Football&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Sporting Goods&quot;, price: &quot;$9.99&quot;, stocked: true, name: &quot;Baseball&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Sporting Goods&quot;, price: &quot;$29.99&quot;, stocked: false, name: &quot;Basketball&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Electronics&quot;, price: &quot;$99.99&quot;, stocked: true, name: &quot;iPod Touch&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Electronics&quot;, price: &quot;$399.99&quot;, stocked: false, name: &quot;iPhone 5&quot;},
  {category: &quot;Electronics&quot;, price: &quot;$199.99&quot;, stocked: true, name: &quot;Nexus 7&quot;}
];</code></pre>
<h2 id="step-1-break-the-ui-into-a-component-hierarchy">Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy</h2>
<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you’re working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!</p>
<p>But how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">single responsibility principle</a>, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.</p>
<p>Since you’re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That’s because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same <em>information architecture</em>. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://reactjs.org/static/eb8bda25806a89ebdc838813bdfa3601/6b2ea/thinking-in-react-components.png" alt="https://reactjs.org/static/eb8bda25806a89ebdc838813bdfa3601/6b2ea/thinking-in-react-components.png" /><figcaption>https://reactjs.org/static/eb8bda25806a89ebdc838813bdfa3601/6b2ea/thinking-in-react-components.png</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You’ll see here that we have five components in our app. We’ve italicized the data each component represents.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong><code>FilterableProductTable</code> (orange):</strong> contains the entirety of the example</li>
<li><strong><code>SearchBar</code> (blue):</strong> receives all <em>user input</em></li>
<li><strong><code>ProductTable</code> (green):</strong> displays and filters the <em>data collection</em> based on <em>user input</em></li>
<li><strong><code>ProductCategoryRow</code> (turquoise):</strong> displays a heading for each <em>category</em></li>
<li><strong><code>ProductRow</code> (red):</strong> displays a row for each <em>product</em></li>
</ol>
<p>If you look at <code>ProductTable</code>, you’ll see that the table header (containing the "Name” and "Price” labels) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there’s an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of <code>ProductTable</code> because it is part of rendering the <em>data collection</em> which is <code>ProductTable</code>’s responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if we were to add affordances for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own <code>ProductTableHeader</code> component.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve identified the components in our mock, let’s arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>FilterableProductTable</code>
<ul>
<li><code>SearchBar</code></li>
<li><code>ProductTable</code></li>
<li><code>ProductCategoryRow</code></li>
<li><code>ProductRow</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react">Step 2: Build A Static Version in React</h2>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/BwWzwm">Thinking In React: Step 2</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why.</p>
<p>To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using <em>props</em>. <em>props</em> are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of <em>state</em>, <strong>don’t use state at all</strong> to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.</p>
<p>You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with <code>FilterableProductTable</code>) or with the ones lower in it (<code>ProductRow</code>). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.</p>
<p>At the end of this step, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have <code>render()</code> methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (<code>FilterableProductTable</code>) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> again, the UI will be updated. You can see how your UI is updated and where to make changes. React’s <strong>one-way data flow</strong> (also called <em>one-way binding</em>) keeps everything modular and fast.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/">React docs</a> if you need help executing this step.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-interlude-props-vs-state">A Brief Interlude: Props vs State</h2>
<p>There are two types of "model” data in React: props and state. It’s important to understand the distinction between the two; skim <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">the official React docs</a> if you aren’t sure what the difference is. See also <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html#what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props">FAQ: What is the difference between state and props?</a></p>
<h2 id="step-3-identify-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state">Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State</h2>
<p>To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with <strong>state</strong>.</p>
<p>To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#39;t_repeat_yourself">DRY: <em>Don’t Repeat Yourself</em></a>. Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.</p>
<p>Think of all the pieces of data in our example application. We have:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original list of products</li>
<li>The search text the user has entered</li>
<li>The value of the checkbox</li>
<li>The filtered list of products</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s go through each one and figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.</li>
<li>Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.</li>
<li>Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.</li>
</ol>
<p>The original list of products is passed in as props, so that’s not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can’t be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.</p>
<p>So finally, our state is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The search text the user has entered</li>
<li>The value of the checkbox</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-4-identify-where-your-state-should-live">Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live</h2>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/qPrNQZ">Thinking In React: Step 4</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>OK, so we’ve identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or <em>owns</em>, this state.</p>
<p>Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. <strong>This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand,</strong> so follow these steps to figure it out:</p>
<p>For each piece of state in your application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify every component that renders something based on that state.</li>
<li>Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).</li>
<li>Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.</li>
<li>If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s run through this strategy for our application:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ProductTable</code> needs to filter the product list based on state and <code>SearchBar</code> needs to display the search text and checked state.</li>
<li>The common owner component is <code>FilterableProductTable</code>.</li>
<li>It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in <code>FilterableProductTable</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Cool, so we’ve decided that our state lives in <code>FilterableProductTable</code>. First, add an instance property <code>this.state = {filterText: '', inStockOnly: false}</code> to <code>FilterableProductTable</code>’s <code>constructor</code> to reflect the initial state of your application. Then, pass <code>filterText</code> and <code>inStockOnly</code> to <code>ProductTable</code> and <code>SearchBar</code> as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in <code>ProductTable</code> and set the values of the form fields in <code>SearchBar</code>.</p>
<p>You can start seeing how your application will behave: set <code>filterText</code> to <code>"ball"</code> and refresh your app. You’ll see that the data table is updated correctly.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-add-inverse-data-flow">Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow</h2>
<p>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/LzWZvb">Thinking In React: Step 5</a> on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it’s time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in <code>FilterableProductTable</code>.</p>
<p>React makes this data flow explicit to help you understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding.</p>
<p>If you try to type or check the box in the current version of the example, you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we’ve set the <code>value</code> prop of the <code>input</code> to always be equal to the <code>state</code> passed in from <code>FilterableProductTable</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, <code>FilterableProductTable</code> will pass callbacks to <code>SearchBar</code> that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the <code>onChange</code> event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by <code>FilterableProductTable</code> will call <code>setState()</code>, and the app will be updated.</p>
<h2 id="and-thats-it">And That’s It</h2>
<p>Hopefully, this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you’re used to, remember that code is read far more than it’s written, and it’s less difficult to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components, you’ll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse, your lines of code will start to shrink. :)</p>
