tip-tldr: A trick to control the timeout

categories: - en - javascript

---

In case of established websocket connection, server or firewall could timeout and terminate the connection after a period of inactivity. To deal with this situation, we send periodic message to the server. To control the timeout we will add two functions in our code : one to make sure connection keep alive and another one to cancel the keep alive. Also we need a common `timerID` variable.
Let's have a look on implementation-

```js
var timerID = 0;
function keepAlive() {
    var timeout = 20000;
    if (webSocket.readyState == webSocket.OPEN) {
        webSocket.send('');
    }
    timerId = setTimeout(keepAlive, timeout);
}
function cancelKeepAlive() {
    if (timerId) {
        clearTimeout(timerId);
    }
}
```

Now as we have both of our desired function for the task, we will place `keepAlive()` function at the end of `onOpen()` method of websocket connection and `cancelKeepAlive()` function at the end of `onClose()` method of websocket connection.

Yes! We have perfectly implemented hack for websocket timeout problem.
