<p>In computer science, a <strong>graph</strong> is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics, specifically the field of graph theory</p>
<p>A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.</p>
