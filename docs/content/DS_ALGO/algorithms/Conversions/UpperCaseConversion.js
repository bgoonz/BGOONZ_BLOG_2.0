/*
    Explanation :- A user gives a string (it can be incomplete lowercase or
        partially in lowercase) and then the program converts it into a
        completely (all characters in uppercase) uppercase string. The
        logic we have used in the following program is: All the lowercase
        characters (a-z) has [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) value ranging from 97 to 122 and their
        corresponding uppercase characters (A-Z) have ASCII values 32
        lesser than them. For example ‘a‘ has an ASCII value of 97
        and ‘A‘ has an ASCII value of 65 (97 - 32). The same applies to other
        characters.

 * upperCaseConversion takes any case-style string and converts it to the uppercase-style string.

        const presentCharCode = char.charCodeAt();
        // If the character code lies between 97 to 122, it means they are in the lowercase so convert it.
        if (presentCharCode >= 97 && presentCharCode <= 122) {
            // Convert the case by use of the above explanation.
            return String.fromCharCode(presentCharCode - 32);
        }
