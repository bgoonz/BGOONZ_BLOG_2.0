/*
    Explanation :- a user gives a String (it can be incomplete uppercase or
        partial uppercase) and then the program would convert it into a
        complete(all characters in lower case) lower case string. The
        logic we have used in the following program is: All the upper case
        characters (A-Z) has ASCII value ranging from 65 to 90 and their
        corresponding lower case characters (a-z) have ASCII values 32
        greater than them. For example ‘A‘ has an ASCII value of 65
        and ‘a‘ has an ASCII value of 97 (65+32). The same applies to other
        characters.

/**
 * LowerCaseConversion takes any case-style string and converts it to the lower case-style string.
 * @param {String} inputString any case style string
 * @returns {String} lower case string

    // Take a string and split it into characters.

        const presentCharCode = char.charCodeAt();
        // If the character code lies between 65 to 90 it means they are in the upper case so convert it.
        if (presentCharCode >= 65 && presentCharCode <= 90) {

            return String.fromCharCode(presentCharCode + 32);
