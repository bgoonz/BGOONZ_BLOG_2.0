/*
 * Problem Statement: Given a positive number `num`, find it's binary equivalent using recursion
 *
 * What is Binary Equivalent?
 * - In binary number system, a number is represented in terms of 0s and 1s,
 *   for example:
 *    - Binary Of 2 = 10
 *    - Binary of 3 = 11
 *    - Binary of 4 = 100
