/**
 * Validate a given credit card number
 *
 * The core of the validation of credit card numbers is the Luhn algorithm.
 *
 * The validation sum should be completely divisible by 10 which is calculated as follows,
 * every first digit is added directly to the validation sum.
 * For every second digit in the credit card number, the digit is multiplied by 2.
 * If the product is greater than 10 the digits of the product are added.
 * This resultant digit is considered for the validation sum rather than the digit itself.
