 * Hamming Distance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance
 *
 *
 * Hamming distance is a metric for comparing two binary data strings.
 *
 * While comparing two binary strings of equal length, Hamming distance
 * is the number of bit positions in which the two bits are different.
 * The Hamming distance between two strings, a and b is denoted as d(a,b)
