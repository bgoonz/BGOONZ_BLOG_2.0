/*
    Quicksort is the most popular sorting algorithm and there have
    lots of different implementations but the "recursive" or "Partition in place"
    is one of the most efficient implementations below we have discussed how to
    implement it.

    Partition in place => "in place" Partition in place indicates that we
    do not need any other space to store the auxiliary array and the term
    "partition" denotes that we split the list into two parts one is less
    than the pivot and the other is greater than the pivot and repeats this
    process recursively and breaks the problem into sub-problems and makes
    it singular so that the behavior or "divide and conquer" get involved
    too.
