            The ongoing conversation about JAMstack has moved from being just a stack for creating static sites to a stack for developing dynamic web
            applications. Let’s take a look at an extensive list of APIs and tools you can leverage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The JAMstack ecosystem has evolved over the past few years. It’s been getting more popular as people have moved on from the mistaken notion that
            only static sites can be rendered using this architecture. We see developers and companies adopting it and creating fast and dynamic web
            applications with helpful services and APIs while maintaining the benefits of the JAMstack, which prioritizes performance, scalability and developer
            experience.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-a-in-the-jamstack">The “A” in the JAMstack</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>A</strong> in <strong>JAMstack</strong> stands for APIs. We no longer need to worry about dealing with traditional back-end -
            server-side operations can now be abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third-party services or your
            custom function written as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service">Functions as a Service</a> (serverless functions). Let’s
            explore a list of useful APIs and related tools that can make your JAMstack projects dynamic.

        <p>
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/">AWS Amplify</a> is a development platform that includes features like a data store that syncs data between
            your site and the cloud, authentication, machine learning, analytics and more. It provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different
            categories of cloud operations. AWS Amplify goes well with any JavaScript based front-end workflow and React Native for mobile developers. The
            default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS), but AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom back-end or
            service.

        <p>
            Interactions on the web are very important and creating a platform to engage with users and to communicate is a no-brainer.
            <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> is one of the platforms you should take a look at if you are looking to add comments functionality to your
            website or blog. <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> is a comment hosting service for web sites and online communities that uses a networked
            platform complete with social network integration, advanced administration, and moderation options. While Disqus is often embedded, it also has an
            <a href="https://disqus.com/api/docs/">extensive API</a>.

            FaunaDB is a globally-distributed, serverless, cloud database management system for modern applications and highly recommended for use with JAMstack
            sites. It enables you to instantly create a full-featured data back-end for applications, taking away the need to worry about managing a traditional
            database. It offers a great development experience in part by supporting both the Fauna Query Language but also native GraphQL.

        <p>
            Netlify Forms is a great service for integrating forms into your JAMstack site. There is no JavaScript required, Netlify’s build bots make it work
            by parsing your HTML files directly at deploy time. This means that there’s no need for you to make an API call or include extra JavaScript on your
            site. You only need to pass a <code>netlify</code> attribute or <code>data-netlify="true"</code> for JavaScript rendered forms to your
            <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag. Note that your site needs to be deployed to Netlify for this to work as you will be receiving all form submissions
            via your Netlify dashboard.

            applications without having to become security experts. You can connect your JAMstack application to Auth0 and set the identity providers you want
            to use (i.e. how you want your users to log in) and based on your app’s technology, choose one of the SDKs or call the API, and hook it up to your
            app.
