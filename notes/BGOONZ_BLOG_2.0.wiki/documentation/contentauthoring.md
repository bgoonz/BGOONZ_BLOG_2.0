Welcome to the BGOONZ_BLOG_2.0 wiki!
# How to install, setup and add new content to a Blog starter - front-end dev with Greg

> Front-end web development with Greg is an educational project.

You install the starter like any other GatsbyJS [starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/) - with the following GatsbyJS CLI command.

    gatsby new [NEW_SITE_DIRECTORY_FOR_YOUR_BLOG] https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-personal-blog.git

Of course you have to install the [GatsbyJS CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) first, but I assume the PersonalBlog is not the first GatsbyJS starter you are installing so the CLI is already installed on your computer.

I do not recommend the PersonalBlog as your starting point with GatsbyJS. If you have no experience at all with GatsbyJS please go through the [official Tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) first.

After GatsbyJS CLI finishes installation you should be able to run `gatsby develop` command. Run the command from the inside of the newly created directory.

    cd [NEW_SITE_DIRECTORY_FOR_YOUR_BLOG]
    gatsby develop

You will see something more or less like this:

    λ gatsby develop
    success delete html and css files from previous builds — 0.277 s
    success open and validate gatsby-config — 0.024 s
    success copy gatsby files — 0.079 s
    success onPreBootstrap — 3.538 s
    success source and transform nodes — 0.676 s
    success building schema — 0.839 s
    success createLayouts — 0.026 s
    success createPages — 0.169 s
    success createPagesStatefully — 0.059 s
    success onPreExtractQueries — 0.010 s
    success update schema — 0.270 s
    success extract queries from components — 0.337 s
    success run graphql queries — 0.687 s
    success write out page data — 0.015 s
    success write out redirect data — 0.002 s
    success onPostBootstrap — 0.001 s
    
    info bootstrap finished
     DONE  Compiled successfully
    
    You can now view gatsby-starter-personal-blog in the browser.
      http://localhost:8000/

That means you can see the blog running in your web browser under the `http://localhost:8000/` address.

Folders structure
-----------------

This is the starter’s main folders structure.

    root
      ├── .cache
      ├── content
      ├── node_modules
      ├── src
      └── static

Content
-------

To easily customize all texts of the blog, not only posts, I extracted all content to its own separate folder.

The folder contains four subfolders.

    root
      ├── content
      │   ├── meta
      │   ├── pages
      │   ├── parts
      │   └── posts

### Meta

There is a `config.js` file inside the `/content/meta/` folder.

    root
      ├── content
      │   ├── meta
      │   │   └── config.js

Content of the `config.js` file.

    module.exports = {
      siteTitle: "PersonalBlog - a blog starter for GatsbyJS", 
      shortSiteTitle: "PersonalBlog GatsbyJS Starter", 
      siteDescription: "PersonalBlog is a GatsbyJS starter.",
      siteUrl: "https://gatsby-starter-personal-blog.greglobinski.com",
      siteImage: "preview.jpg",
      siteLanguage: "en",
      
      authorName: "greg lobinski",
      authorTwitterAccount: "greglobinski",
      
      infoTitle: "greg lobinski",
      infoTitleNote: "personal blog",
      
      manifestName: "PersonalBlog - a blog starter for GatsbyJS",
      manifestShortName: "PersonalBlog", 
      manifestStartUrl: "/",
      manifestBackgroundColor: colors.bg,
      manifestThemeColor: colors.bg,
      manifestDisplay: "standalone",
      
      authorSocialLinks: [
        { name: "github", url: "https://github.com/greglobinski" },
        { name: "twitter", url: "https://twitter.com/greglobinski" },
        { name: "facebook", url: "http://facebook.com/greglobinski" }
      ]
    };

Edit values of the object’s properties according to your needs.

### Posts

Every blog post has its own folder.

    root
      ├── content
      │   ├── posts
      │   │   ├── 2017-10-01--two-things-are-infinite
      │   │   ├── 2017-10-03--be-who-you-are
      │   │   ├── 2017-10-05--you-only-live-once

When you change or add new post, remeber to keep up with the post folder name pattern.

    /YYYY-MM-DD--title-of-post/

There are three obligatory parts:

*   a post date prefix `YYYY-MM-DD`,
*   a separator `--` (two dashes)
*   a slug

Only posts inside properly named folders are displayed on the blog post list.

Pages
-----

The same way as posts, every page has its own folder.

    root
      ├── content
      │   ├── pages
      │   │   ├── 1--about
      │   │   ├── 2--starters
      │   │   └── success

When you change or add new page, remember to properly use the page folder name pattern.

There are three parts.

*   a page order number prefix `No` (one or more digit)
*   a separator `--` (two dashes)
*   a slug

Only pages inside folders with order prefix are displayed in the Info menu.

Parts
-----

Through `parts` you can edit content of elements which are parts of the blog’s layout, like an author note under a post or a footer.

    root
      ├── content
      │   ├── parts
      │   │   ├── author.md
      │   │   ├── footnote.md
      │   │   └── info.md

Environment variables
---------------------

The starter uses some external services:

*   Analytics by [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/)
*   Comments by [Facebook Comments](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/)
*   Search by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)

To make them work you have to secure some access data. All services are free or have generous free tiers big enough for a personal blog.

Create a file in the root folder called `.env` with content like below.

    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=...
    ALGOLIA_APP_ID=...
    ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY=...
    ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY=...
    ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=...
    FB_APP_ID=...

Change `...` to real strings. Do not use quote marks. Put data strings after the equal signs. Like in the example below.

    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=UA-123456789-0

You do not have to create `.env` file just after the instalation. The `gatsby develop` command should work without it. At least it works on my localhost environment. If you get an `GraphQL Error` using `gatsby develop` just after the installation, create the `.env` file with the variables like above, even with empty string as the values.

For `gatsby build` you absolutely need a real Algolia access data, without it the `gatsby build` command will throw an error.

If you want to delay singing-up to Algolia you can temporarily turn off `gatsby-plugin-algolia`. Open the `gatsby-config.js` file in the root folder and comment or remove the `gatsby-plugin-algolia` setup.

    plugins: [
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,

But hey, it’s not diffucult or long to [setup](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/setup-algolia-account/) your Algolia account for the starter.

Summary
-------

That’s all for the first step. Now you should have a running blog with your own data running on your localhost. In the next post we will talk how to change the look of your blog. Stay tuned.
