This tutorial primarily focuses on JavaScript following the [ECMAScript 5][es5]
(ES5) specification. [ES2015][] (also known as ES6) was released in 2015 and
brings many new features to the language, including new syntax constructs.

While this tutorial won't go into detail about new features in ES2015 and newer
versions, it will point differences to/alternatives for certain ES5 features if
they exist.
