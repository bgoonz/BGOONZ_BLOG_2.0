JavaScript is predominantly run in browsers to make websites interactive. In
order to do that, the browser provides access to other technologies, such as
[CSS][] and the [DOM][].

This presentation is exclusively about JavaScript, the _language_, not the
environment in which the JavaScript code runs!
