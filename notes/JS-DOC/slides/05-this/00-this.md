# What is `this`?

[**`this`**][mdn] is a special "variable" which implicitly exists in every
function. It can be thought of being similar to Java's `this` and Python's
`self`, but it's much more flexible than that.

<div class="callout warning">

**Important**: The value of `this` is determined when the
function is **called**, not when the function is
_defined_.

</div>

Given the following function:

---


```js


function foo() {
    console.log(this);
}
```

these would be the values of `this` if called in those specific ways:

```js
// "normal call": global object / window in browsers
//                undefined in strict mode
foo();

// as object "method": to the object
var obj = { method: foo };
obj.method();

// via .call / .apply: To the value passed as first argument
foo.call(bar);
```
