# switch

The `switch` statement evaluates an [expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators), matching the expression's value to a `case` clause, and executes [statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements) associated with that `case`, as well as statements in `case`s that follow the matching `case`.

## Syntax

    switch (expression) {
      case value1:
        //Statements executed when the
        //result of expression matches value1
        [break;]
      case value2:
        //Statements executed when the
        //result of expression matches value2
        [break;]
      ...
      case valueN:
        //Statements executed when the
        //result of expression matches valueN
        [break;]
      [default:
        //Statements executed when none of
        //the values match the value of the expression
        [break;]]
    }

`expression`  
An expression whose result is matched against each `case` clause.

`case valueN` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
A `case` clause used to match against `expression`. If the `expression` matches the specified `valueN`, the statements inside the `case` clause are executed until either the end of the `switch` statement or a `break`.

`default` <span class="badge inline optional">Optional</span>  
A `default` clause; if provided, this clause is executed if the value of `expression` doesn't match any of the `case` clauses.

## Description

A `switch` statement first evaluates its expression. It then looks for the first `case` clause whose expression evaluates to the same value as the result of the input expression (using the [strict comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators), `===`) and transfers control to that clause, executing the associated statements. (If multiple `case`s match the provided value, the first `case` that matches is selected, even if the `case`s are not equal to each other.)

If no matching `case` clause is found, the program looks for the optional `default` clause, and if found, transfers control to that clause, executing the associated statements. If no `default` clause is found, the program continues execution at the statement following the end of `switch`. By convention, the `default` clause is the last clause, but it does not need to be so.

The optional `break` statement associated with each `case` label ensures that the program breaks out of `switch` once the matched statement is executed and continues execution at the statement following `switch`. If `break` is omitted, the program continues execution at the next statement in the `switch` statement. The `break` statement is not required if a `return` statement precedes it.

## Examples

### Using `switch`

In the following example, if `expr` evaluates to `Bananas`, the program matches the value with case `case 'Bananas'` and executes the associated statement. When `break` is encountered, the program breaks out of `switch` and executes the statement following `switch`. If `break` were omitted, the statement for the `case 'Cherries'` would also be executed.

    switch (expr) {
      case 'Oranges':
        console.log('Oranges are $0.59 a pound.');
        break;
      case 'Apples':
        console.log('Apples are $0.32 a pound.');
        break;
      case 'Bananas':
        console.log('Bananas are $0.48 a pound.');
        break;
      case 'Cherries':
        console.log('Cherries are $3.00 a pound.');
        break;
      case 'Mangoes':
      case 'Papayas':
        console.log('Mangoes and papayas are $2.79 a pound.');
        break;
      default:
        console.log('Sorry, we are out of ' + expr + '.');
    }

    console.log("Is there anything else you'd like?");

### What happens if I forgot a `break`?

If you forget a `break` then the script will run from the `case` where the criterion is met and will run the cases after that **regardless if a criterion was met**.

See example here:

    var foo = 0;
    switch (foo) {
      case -1:
        console.log('negative 1');
        break;
      case 0: // foo is 0 so criteria met here so this block will run
        console.log(0);
        // NOTE: the forgotten break would have been here
      case 1: // no break statement in 'case 0:' so this case will run as well
        console.log(1);
        break; // it encounters this break so will not continue into 'case 2:'
      case 2:
        console.log(2);
        break;
      default:
        console.log('default');
    }

### Can I put a `default` between cases?

Yes, you can! JavaScript will drop you back to the `default` if it can't find a match:

    var foo = 5;
    switch (foo) {
      case 2:
        console.log(2);
        break; // it encounters this break so will not continue into 'default:'
      default:
        console.log('default')
        // fall-through
      case 1:
        console.log('1');
    }

It also works when you put `default` before all other `case`s.

### Methods for multi-criteria `case`

This technique is also commonly called fall-through.

#### Multi-`case` : single operation

This method takes advantage of the fact that if there is no break below a `case` clause it will continue to execute the next `case` clause regardless if the `case` meets the criteria. (See the section [What happens if I forgot a `break`?](#what_happens_if_i_forgot_a_break))

This is an example of a single operation sequential `case` statement, where four different values perform exactly the same.

    var Animal = 'Giraffe';
    switch (Animal) {
      case 'Cow':
      case 'Giraffe':
      case 'Dog':
      case 'Pig':
        console.log('This animal is not extinct.');
        break;
      case 'Dinosaur':
      default:
        console.log('This animal is extinct.');
    }

#### Multi-`case` : chained operations

This is an example of a multiple-operation sequential `case` clause, where, depending on the provided integer, you can receive different output. This shows you that it will traverse in the order that you put the `case` clauses, and it does not have to be numerically sequential. In JavaScript, you can even mix in definitions of strings into these `case` statements as well.

    var foo = 1;
    var output = 'Output: ';
    switch (foo) {
      case 0:
        output += 'So ';
      case 1:
        output += 'What ';
        output += 'Is ';
      case 2:
        output += 'Your ';
      case 3:
        output += 'Name';
      case 4:
        output += '?';
        console.log(output);
        break;
      case 5:
        output += '!';
        console.log(output);
        break;
      default:
        console.log('Please pick a number from 0 to 5!');
    }

The output from this example:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Value</th><th>Log text</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>foo</code> is <code>NaN</code> or not <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, or <code>0</code></td><td>Please pick a number from 0 to 5!</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>0</code></td><td>Output: So What Is Your Name?</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>1</code></td><td>Output: What Is Your Name?</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>2</code></td><td>Output: Your Name?</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>3</code></td><td>Output: Name?</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>4</code></td><td>Output: ?</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>5</code></td><td>Output: !</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Block-scope variables within `switch` statements

With ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) support made available in most modern browsers, there will be cases where you would want to use [`let`](let) and [`const`](const) statements to declare block-scoped variables.

Take a look at this example:

    const action = 'say_hello';
    switch (action) {
      case 'say_hello':
        let message = 'hello';
        console.log(message);
        break;
      case 'say_hi':
        let message = 'hi';
        console.log(message);
        break;
      default:
        console.log('Empty action received.');
        break;
    }

This example will output the error `Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'message' has already been declared` which you were not probably expecting.

This is because the first `let message = 'hello';` conflicts with second let statement `let message = 'hi';` even they're within their own separate case clauses `case 'say_hello':` and `case 'say_hi':`. Ultimately, this is due to both `let` statements being interpreted as duplicate declarations of the same variable name within the same block scope.

We can easily fix this by wrapping our `case` clauses with brackets:

    const action = 'say_hello';
    switch (action) {
      case 'say_hello': { // added brackets
        let message = 'hello';
        console.log(message);
        break;
      } // added brackets
      case 'say_hi': { // added brackets
        let message = 'hi';
        console.log(message);
        break;
      } // added brackets
      default: { // added brackets
        console.log('Empty action received.');
        break;
      } // added brackets
    }

This code will now output `hello` in the console as it should, without any errors at all.
