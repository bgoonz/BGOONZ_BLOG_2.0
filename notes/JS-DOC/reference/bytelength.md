# SharedArrayBuffer.prototype.byteLength

The `byteLength` accessor property represents the length of an [`SharedArrayBuffer`](../sharedarraybuffer) in bytes.

## Description

The `byteLength` property is an accessor property whose set accessor function is `undefined`, meaning that you can only read this property. The value is established when the shared array is constructed and cannot be changed.

## Examples

### Using byteLength

    var sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
    sab.byteLength; // 1024
