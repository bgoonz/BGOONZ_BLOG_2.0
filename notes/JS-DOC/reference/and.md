# Atomics.and()

The static ` Atomics``.and() ` method computes a bitwise AND with a given value at a given position in the array, and returns the old value at that position. This atomic operation guarantees that no other write happens until the modified value is written back.

## Syntax

    Atomics.and(typedArray, index, value)

### Parameters

`typedArray`  
An integer typed array. One of [`Int8Array`](../int8array), [`Uint8Array`](../uint8array), [`Int16Array`](../int16array), [`Uint16Array`](../uint16array), [`Int32Array`](../int32array), [`Uint32Array`](../uint32array), [`BigInt64Array`](../bigint64array), or [`BigUint64Array`](../biguint64array).

`index`  
The position in the `typedArray` to compute the bitwise AND.

`value`  
The number to compute the bitwise AND with.

### Return value

The old value at the given position (`typedArray[index]`).

### Exceptions

- Throws a [`TypeError`](../typeerror), if `typedArray` is not one of the allowed integer types.
- Throws a [`RangeError`](../rangeerror), if `index` is out of bounds in the `typedArray`.

## Description

The bitwise AND operation only yields 1, if both `a` and `b` are 1. The truth table for the AND operation is:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th><code>a</code></th><th><code>b</code></th><th><code>a &amp; b</code></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

For example, a bitwise AND of `5 & 1` results in `0001` which is 1 in decimal.

    5  0101
    1  0001
       ----
    1  0001

## Examples

### Using and()

    const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
    const ta = new Uint8Array(sab);
    ta[0] = 5;

    Atomics.and(ta, 0, 1); // returns 0, the old value
    Atomics.load(ta, 0);  // 1
