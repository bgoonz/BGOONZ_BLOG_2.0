# if...else

The `if` statement executes a statement if a specified condition is [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy). If the condition is [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy), another statement can be executed.

## Syntax

    if (condition) {
       statement1
    } else {
       statement2
    }

`condition`  
An [expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#expressions) that is considered to be either [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) or [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy).

`statement1`  
Statement that is executed if condition is [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy). Can be any statement, including further nested `if` statements. To execute multiple statements, use a [block](block) statement (`{ ... }`) to group those statements. To execute no statements, use an [empty](empty) statement.

`statement2`  
Statement that is executed if `condition` is [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) and the `else` clause exists. Can be any statement, including block statements and further nested `if` statements.

## Description

Multiple `if...else` statements can be nested to create an `else if` clause. Note that there is no `elseif` (in one word) keyword in JavaScript.

    if (condition1)
      statement1
    else if (condition2)
      statement2
    else if (condition3)
      statement3
    ...
    else
      statementN

To see how this works, this is how it would look if the nesting were properly indented:

    if (condition1)
      statement1
    else
      if (condition2)
        statement2
      else
        if (condition3)
    ...

To execute multiple statements within a clause, use a block statement (`{ ... }`) to group those statements. In general, it is a good practice to always use block statements, especially in code involving nested `if` statements:

    if (condition) {
      statements1
    } else {
      statements2
    }

Do not confuse the primitive Boolean values `true` and `false` with truthiness or falsiness of the [`Boolean`](../global_objects/boolean) object. Any value that is not `false`, `undefined`, `null`, `0`, `-0`, `NaN`, or the empty string (`""`), and any object, including a Boolean object whose value is `false`, is considered [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) when used as the condition. For example:

    var b = new Boolean(false);
    if (b) // this condition is truthy

## Examples

### Using if...else

    if (cipher_char === from_char) {
      result = result + to_char;
      x++;
    } else {
      result = result + clear_char;
    }

### Using else if

Note that there is no `elseif` syntax in JavaScript. However, you can write it with a space between `else` and `if`:

    if (x > 50) {
      /* do something */
    } else if (x > 5) {
      /* do something */
    } else {
      /* do something */
    }

### Assignment within the conditional expression

It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:

    if (x = y) {
      /* do something */
    }

If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

    if ((x = y)) {
      /* do something */
    }
