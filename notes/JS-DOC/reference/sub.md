# Atomics.sub()

The static `Atomics.sub()` method substracts a given value at a given position in the array and returns the old value at that position. This atomic operation guarantees that no other write happens until the modified value is written back.

## Syntax

    Atomics.sub(typedArray, index, value)

### Parameters

`typedArray`  
An integer typed array. One of [`Int8Array`](../int8array), [`Uint8Array`](../uint8array), [`Int16Array`](../int16array), [`Uint16Array`](../uint16array), [`Int32Array`](../int32array), [`Uint32Array`](../uint32array), [`BigInt64Array`](../bigint64array), or [`BigUint64Array`](../biguint64array).

`index`  
The position in the `typedArray` to subtract a `value` from.

`value`  
The number to subtract.

### Return value

The old value at the given position (`typedArray[index]`).

### Exceptions

-   Throws a [`TypeError`](../typeerror), if `typedArray` is not one of the allowed integer types.
-   Throws a [`RangeError`](../rangeerror), if `index` is out of bounds in the `typedArray`.

## Examples

### Using sub

    const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
    const ta = new Uint8Array(sab);
    ta[0] = 48;

    Atomics.sub(ta, 0, 12); // returns 48, the old value
    Atomics.load(ta, 0); // 36
