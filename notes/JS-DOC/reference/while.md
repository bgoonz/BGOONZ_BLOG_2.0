# while

The **while statement** creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates to true. The condition is evaluated before executing the statement.

## Syntax

    while (condition)
      statement

`condition`  
An expression evaluated before each pass through the loop. If this condition evaluates to true, `statement` is executed. When condition evaluates to false, execution continues with the statement after the `while` loop.

`statement`  
An optional statement that is executed as long as the condition evaluates to true. To execute multiple statements within the loop, use a [block](block) statement (`{ ... }`) to group those statements.

Note: Use the `break` statement to stop a loop before condition evaluates to true.

## Examples

### Using while

The following `while` loop iterates as long as `n` is less than three.

    var n = 0;
    var x = 0;

    while (n < 3) {
      n++;
      x += n;
    }

Each iteration, the loop increments `n` and adds it to `x`. Therefore, `x` and `n` take on the following values:

-   After the first pass: `n` = 1 and `x` = 1
-   After the second pass: `n` = 2 and `x` = 3
-   After the third pass: `n` = 3 and `x` = 6

After completing the third pass, the condition `n` &lt; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
