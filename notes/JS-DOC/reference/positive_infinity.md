## Description

The value of `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` is the same as the value of the global object's [`Infinity`](../infinity) property.

This value behaves slightly differently than mathematical infinity:

-   Any positive value, including `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, multiplied by `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is `POSITIVE_INFINITY`.
-   Any negative value, including [`NEGATIVE_INFINITY`](negative_infinity), multiplied by `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is [`NEGATIVE_INFINITY`](negative_infinity).
-   Any positive number divided by `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is positive Zero.
-   Any negative number divided by `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is negative Zero.
-   Zero multiplied by `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is [`NaN`](../nan).
-   [`NaN`](../nan) multiplied by `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is [`NaN`](../nan).
-   `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, divided by any negative value except [`NEGATIVE_INFINITY`](negative_infinity), is [`NEGATIVE_INFINITY`](negative_infinity).
-   `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, divided by any positive value except `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, is `POSITIVE_INFINITY`.
-   `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, divided by either [`NEGATIVE_INFINITY`](negative_infinity) or `POSITIVE_INFINITY`, is [`NaN`](../nan).

You might use the `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` property to indicate an error condition that returns a finite number in case of success. Note, however, that [`isFinite`](../isfinite) would be more appropriate in such a case.

Because `POSITIVE_INFINITY` is a static property of [`Number`](../number), you always use it as `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, rather than as a property of a [`Number`](../number) object you created.

## Examples

### Using POSITIVE_INFINITY

In the following example, the variable `bigNumber` is assigned a value that is larger than the maximum value. When the [`if`](../../statements/if...else) statement executes, `bigNumber` has the value `Infinity`, so `bigNumber` is set to a more manageable value before continuing.

    var bigNumber = Number.MAX_VALUE * 2;

    if (bigNumber == Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY) {
      bigNumber = returnFinite();
    }
