# Warning: -file- is being assigned a //\# sourceMappingURL, but already has one

The JavaScript warning "-file- is being assigned a //\# sourceMappingURL, but already has one." occurs when a source map has been specified more than once for a given JavaScript source.

## Message

    Warning: -file- is being assigned a //# sourceMappingURL, but already has one.

## Error type

A warning. JavaScript execution won't be halted.

## What went wrong?

A source map has been specified more than once for a given JavaScript source.

JavaScript sources are often combined and minified to make delivering them from the server more efficient. With [source maps](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/), the debugger can map the code being executed to the original source files. There are two ways to assign a source map, either by using a comment or by setting a header to the JavaScript file.

## Examples

### Setting source maps

Setting a source map by using a comment in the file:

    //# sourceMappingURL=http://example.com/path/to/your/sourcemap.map

Or, alternatively, you can set a header to your JavaScript file:

    X-SourceMap: /path/to/file.js.map
