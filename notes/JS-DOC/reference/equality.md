# Equality (==)

The equality operator (`==`) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the [strict equality](strict_equality) operator, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.

## Syntax

    x == y

## Description

The equality operators (`==` and `!=`) use the [Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3) to compare two operands. This can be roughly summarised as follows:

-   If the operands are both objects, return `true` only if both operands reference the same object.
-   If one operand is `null` and the other is `undefined`, return `true`.
-   If the operands are of different types, try to convert them to the same type before comparing:
    -   When comparing a number to a string, try to convert the string to a numeric value.
    -   If one of the operands is `Boolean`, convert the Boolean operand to 1 if it is `true` and +0 if it is `false`.
    -   If one of the operands is an object and the other is a number or a string, try to convert the object to a primitive using the object's `valueOf()` and `toString()` methods.
-   If the operands have the same type, they are compared as follows:
    -   `String`: return `true` only if both operands have the same characters in the same order.
    -   `Number`: return `true` only if both operands have the same value. `+0` and `-0` are treated as the same value. If either operand is `NaN`, return `false`.
    -   `Boolean`: return `true` only if operands are both `true` or both `false`.

The most notable difference between this operator and the [strict equality](strict_equality) (`===`) operator is that the strict equality operator does not attempt type conversion. Instead, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

## Examples

### Comparison with no type conversion

    1 == 1;              // true
    "hello" == "hello";  // true

### Comparison with type conversion

    "1" ==  1;            // true
    1 == "1";             // true
    0 == false;           // true
    0 == null;            // false
    0 == undefined;       // false
    0 == !!null;          // true, look at Logical NOT operator
    0 == !!undefined;     // true, look at Logical NOT operator
    null == undefined;    // true

    const number1 = new Number(3);
    const number2 = new Number(3);
    number1 == 3;         // true
    number1 == number2;   // false

### Comparison of objects

    const object1 = {"key": "value"}
    const object2 = {"key": "value"};

    object1 == object2 // false
    object2 == object2 // true

### Comparing strings and String objects

Note that strings constructed using `new String()` are objects. If you compare one of these with a string literal, the `String` object will be converted to a string literal and the contents will be compared. However, if both operands are `String` objects, then they are compared as objects and must reference the same object for comparison to succeed:

    const string1 = "hello";
    const string2 = String("hello");
    const string3 = new String("hello");
    const string4 = new String("hello");

    console.log(string1 == string2); // true
    console.log(string1 == string3); // true
    console.log(string2 == string3); // true
    console.log(string3 == string4); // false
    console.log(string4 == string4); // true

### Comparing Dates and strings

    const d = new Date('December 17, 1995 03:24:00');
    const s = d.toString(); // for example: "Sun Dec 17 1995 03:24:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)"
    console.log(d == s);    //true
