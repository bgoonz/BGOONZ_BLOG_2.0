## Description

`Number.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest positive number (not the most negative number) that can be represented within float precision — in other words, the number closest to 0. That's approximately `5e-324` (`5 × 10-324`). The ECMAScript spec doesn't define a precise value that implementations are required to support — instead the spec says, _"must be the smallest non-zero positive value that can actually be represented by the implementation"_. But in practice, its precise value in browsers and in Node.js is `2-1074`.

Because `MIN_VALUE` is a static property of [`Number`](../number), you always use it as `Number.MIN_VALUE`, rather than as a property of a [`Number`](../number) object you created.

## Examples

### Using MIN_VALUE

The following code divides two numeric values. If the result is greater than or equal to `MIN_VALUE`, the `func1` function is called; otherwise, the `func2` function is called.

    if (num1 / num2 >= Number.MIN_VALUE) {
      func1();
    } else {
      func2();
    }
