# new operator

The `new` lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

## Syntax

    new constructor[([arguments])]

### Parameters

`constructor`  
A class or function that specifies the type of the object instance.

`arguments`  
A list of values that the `constructor` will be called with.

## Description

The `new` keyword does the following things:

1.  Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object.
2.  Adds a property to the new object (`__proto__`) that links to the constructor function's prototype object
    **Note:** Properties/objects added to the construction function prototype are therefore accessible to all instances created from the constructor function (using `new`).

3.  Binds the newly created object instance as the `this` context (i.e. all references to `this` in the constructor function now refer to the object created in the first step).
4.  Returns `this` if the function doesn't return an object.

Creating a user-defined object requires two steps:

1.  Define the object type by writing a function that specifies its name and properties. For example, a constructor function to create an object `Foo`might look like this:

        function Foo(bar1, bar2) {
              this.bar1 = bar1;
              this.bar2 = bar2;
            }

2.  Create an instance of the object with `new`.

        var myFoo = new Foo('Bar 1', 2021);

**Note:** An object can have a property that is itself another object. See the examples below.

When the code `new Foo(...)` is executed, the following things happen:

1.  A new object is created, inheriting from `Foo.prototype`.
2.  The constructor function `Foo` is called with the specified arguments, and with `this` bound to the newly created object. `new Foo` is equivalent to `new Foo()`, i.e. if no argument list is specified, `Foo` is called without arguments.
3.  The object (not null, false, 3.1415 or other primitive types) returned by the constructor function becomes the result of the whole `new` expression. If the constructor function doesn't explicitly return an object, the object created in step 1 is used instead (normally constructors don't return a value, but they can choose to do so if they want to override the normal object creation process).

You can always add a property to a previously defined object instance. For example, the statement `car1.color = "black"` adds a property `color` to `car1`, and assigns it a value of "`black`".

However, this does not affect any other objects. To add the new property to all objects of the same type, you must add the property to the definition of the `Car` object type.

You can add a shared property to a previously defined object type by using the `Function.prototype` property. This defines a property that is shared by all objects created with that function, rather than by just one instance of the object type. The following code adds a color property with value `"original color"` to all objects of type `Car`, and then overwrites that value with the string "`black`" only in the instance object `car1`. For more information, see [prototype](../global_objects/function).

    function Car() {}
    car1 = new Car();
    car2 = new Car();

    console.log(car1.color);    // undefined

    Car.prototype.color = 'original color';
    console.log(car1.color);    // 'original color'

    car1.color = 'black';
    console.log(car1.color);    // 'black'

    console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(car1).color); // 'original color'
    console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(car2).color); // 'original color'
    console.log(car1.color);   // 'black'
    console.log(car2.color);   // 'original color'

**Note:** While the constructor function can be invoked like any regular function (i.e. without the `new` operator), in this case a new Object is not created and the value of `this` is also different.

## Examples

### Object type and object instance

Suppose you want to create an object type for cars. You want this type of object to be called `Car`, and you want it to have properties for make, model, and year. To do this, you would write the following function:

    function Car(make, model, year) {
      this.make = make;
      this.model = model;
      this.year = year;
    }

Now you can create an object called `myCar` as follows:

    var myCar = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993);

This statement creates `myCar` and assigns it the specified values for its properties. Then the value of `myCar.make` is the string "Eagle", `myCar.year` is the integer 1993, and so on.

You can create any number of `car` objects by calls to `new`. For example:

    var kensCar = new Car('Nissan', '300ZX', 1992);

### Object property that is itself another object

Suppose you define an object called `Person` as follows:

    function Person(name, age, sex) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.sex = sex;
    }

And then instantiate two new `Person` objects as follows:

    var rand = new Person('Rand McNally', 33, 'M');
    var ken = new Person('Ken Jones', 39, 'M');

Then you can rewrite the definition of `Car` to include an `owner` property that takes a `Person` object, as follows:

    function Car(make, model, year, owner) {
      this.make = make;
      this.model = model;
      this.year = year;
      this.owner = owner;
    }

To instantiate the new objects, you then use the following:

    var car1 = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993, rand);
    var car2 = new Car('Nissan', '300ZX', 1992, ken);

Instead of passing a literal string or integer value when creating the new objects, the above statements pass the objects `rand` and `ken` as the parameters for the owners. To find out the name of the owner of `car2`, you can access the following property:

    car2.owner.name
