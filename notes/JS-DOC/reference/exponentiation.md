# Exponentiation (\*\*)

The exponentiation operator (`**`) returns the result of raising the first operand to the power of the second operand. It is equivalent to `Math.pow`, except it also accepts BigInts as operands.

## Syntax

    Operator: var1 ** var2

## Description

The exponentiation operator is right-associative: `a ** b ** c` is equal to `a ** (b ** c)`.

In most languages, such as PHP, Python, and others that have an exponentiation operator (`**`), the exponentiation operator is defined to have a higher precedence than unary operators, such as unary `+` and unary `-`, but there are a few exceptions. For example, in Bash, the `**` operator is defined to have a lower precedence than unary operators.

In JavaScript, it is impossible to write an ambiguous exponentiation expression. That is, you cannot put a unary operator (`+/-/~/!/delete/void/typeof`) immediately before the base number; doing so will cause a SyntaxError.

    -2 ** 2;
    // 4 in Bash, -4 in other languages.
    // This is invalid in JavaScript, as the operation is ambiguous.

    -(2 ** 2);
    // -4 in JavaScript and the author's intention is unambiguous.

Note that some programming languages use the caret symbol ^ for exponentiation, but JavaScript uses that symbol for the [bitwise logical XOR operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#bitwise_xor).

## Examples

### Basic exponentiation

    2 ** 3   // 8
    3 ** 2   // 9
    3 ** 2.5 // 15.588457268119896
    10 ** -1 // 0.1
    NaN ** 2 // NaN

### Associativity

    2 ** 3 ** 2   // 512
    2 ** (3 ** 2) // 512
    (2 ** 3) ** 2 // 64

### Usage with unary operators

To invert the sign of the result of an exponentiation expression:

    -(2 ** 2) // -4

To force the base of an exponentiation expression to be a negative number:

    (-2) ** 2 // 4
