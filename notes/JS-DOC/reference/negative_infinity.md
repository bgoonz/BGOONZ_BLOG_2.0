## Description

The value of `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is the same as the negative value of the global object's [`Infinity`](../infinity) property.

This value behaves slightly differently than mathematical infinity:

-   Any positive value, including [`POSITIVE_INFINITY`](positive_infinity), multiplied by `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.
-   Any negative value, including `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, multiplied by `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is [`POSITIVE_INFINITY`](positive_infinity).
-   Any positive value divided by `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is negative zero.
-   Any negative value divided by `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is positive zero.
-   Zero multiplied by `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is [`NaN`](../nan).
-   [`NaN`](../nan) multiplied by `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is [`NaN`](../nan).
-   `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, divided by any negative value except `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, is [`POSITIVE_INFINITY`](positive_infinity).
-   `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, divided by any positive value except [`POSITIVE_INFINITY`](positive_infinity), is `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`.
-   `NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, divided by either `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` or [`POSITIVE_INFINITY`](positive_infinity), is [`NaN`](../nan).

You might use the `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` property to indicate an error condition that returns a finite number in case of success. Note, however, that [`isFinite`](../isfinite) would be more appropriate in such a case.

Because `NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is a static property of [`Number`](../number), you always use it as `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`, rather than as a property of a [`Number`](../number) object you created.

## Examples

### Using NEGATIVE_INFINITY

In the following example, the variable `smallNumber` is assigned a value that is smaller than the minimum value. When the [`if`](../../statements/if...else) statement executes, `smallNumber` has the value `-Infinity`, so `smallNumber` is set to a more manageable value before continuing.

    var smallNumber = (-Number.MAX_VALUE) * 2;

    if (smallNumber === Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY) {
      smallNumber = returnFinite();
    }
