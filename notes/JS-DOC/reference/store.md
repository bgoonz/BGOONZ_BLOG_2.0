## Syntax

    Atomics.store(typedArray, index, value)

### Parameters

`typedArray`  
An integer typed array. One of [`Int8Array`](../int8array), [`Uint8Array`](../uint8array), [`Int16Array`](../int16array), [`Uint16Array`](../uint16array), [`Int32Array`](../int32array), [`Uint32Array`](../uint32array), [`BigInt64Array`](../bigint64array), or [`BigUint64Array`](../biguint64array).

`index`  
The position in the `typedArray` to store a `value` in.

`value`  
The number to store.

### Return value

The value that has been stored.

### Exceptions

-   Throws a [`TypeError`](../typeerror), if `typedArray` is not one of the allowed integer types.
-   Throws a [`RangeError`](../rangeerror), if `index` is out of bounds in the `typedArray`.

## Examples
