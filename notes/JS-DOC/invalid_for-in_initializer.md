# SyntaxError: for-in loop head declarations may not have initializers

The JavaScript [strict mode](../strict_mode)-only exception "for-in loop head declarations may not have initializers" occurs when the head of a [for...in](../statements/for...in) contains an initializer expression, such as |`for (var i = 0 in obj)`|. This is not allowed in for-of loops in strict mode.

## Message

    SyntaxError: for-in loop head declarations cannot have an initializer (Edge)
    SyntaxError: for-in loop head declarations may not have initializers (Firefox)
    SyntaxError: for-in loop variable declaration may not have an initializer. (Chrome)

## Error type

[`SyntaxError`](../global_objects/syntaxerror) in [strict mode](../strict_mode) only.

## What went wrong?

The head of a [for...in](../statements/for...in) loop contains an initializer expression. That is, a variable is declared and assigned a value |`for (var i = 0 in obj)`|. In non-strict mode, this head declaration is silently ignored and behaves like `|for (var i in obj)|`. In [strict mode](../strict_mode), however, a `SyntaxError` is thrown.

## Examples

This example throws a `SyntaxError`:

    "use strict";

    var obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

    for (var i = 0 in obj) {
      console.log(obj[i]);
    }

    // SyntaxError: for-in loop head declarations may not have initializers

### Valid for-in loop

You can remove the initializer (`i = 0`) in the head of the for-in loop.

    "use strict";

    var obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

    for (var i in obj) {
      console.log(obj[i]);
    }

### Array iteration

The for...in loop [shouldn't be used for Array iteration](../statements/for...in#array_iteration_and_for...in). Did you intend to use a `for` loop instead of a `for-in` loop to iterate an [`Array`](../global_objects/array)? The `for` loop allows you to set an initializer then as well:

    var arr = [ "a", "b", "c" ]

    for (var i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {
      console.log(arr[i]);
    }

    // "c"

-   `for...in`
-   `for...of` - also disallows an initializer in both strict and non-strict mode.
-   `for` - preferred for array iteration, allows to define an initializer.
