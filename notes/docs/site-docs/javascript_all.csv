There are, however, several notable exceptions to this progress such as disk seek time and operating system robustness. In designing Google, we have considered both the rate of growth of the Web and technological changes. Google is designed to scale well to extremely large data sets. It makes efficient use of storage space to store the index. Its data structures are optimized for fast and efficient access (see section 4.2). Further, we expect that the cost to index and store text or HTML will eventually decline relative to the amount that will be available (see Appendix B). This will result in favorable scaling properties for centralized systems like Google.","","","","170","0","198","0","54","0","","","https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/docs/articles/how-search-engines-work/","https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/docs/articles/how-search-engines-work/"
