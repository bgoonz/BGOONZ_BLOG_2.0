  <strong>Note:</strong> This is the demo content for demonstration purpose only. The primary function of this content is to show you what this theme can do. There is a more detailed explanation in the <strong>Getting Started</strong> section.
</div>

### Syntax highlighting

You can add a language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your code block. For example, to highlight the **JavaScript** code, specify `javascript` next to the tick marks before the fenced code block:

<pre>
```javascript
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```
</pre>

The rendered output looks like this:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```

Or to highlight the **CSS** code, specify `css` next to the tick marks before the fenced code block:

<pre>
```css
body {
  background: #fff;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.66667; }

a {
  color: #d4a259;
  text-decoration: underline;
  -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease;
  transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease; }

a:hover {
  color: #1d1d1d;
  text-decoration: none; }
```
</pre>

The rendered output looks like this:

```css
body {
  background: #fff;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.66667; }

a {
  color: #d4a259;
  text-decoration: underline;
  -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease;
  transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease; }

a:hover {
  color: #1d1d1d;
  text-decoration: none; }
```

## Callouts

There are two types of callouts available in this theme, **important** and **note**.

<div class="important">
  <strong>Important:</strong> 
  This is an "Important" callout block of text. 
  This block indicates a warning or caution.
  Use it for an important message. 
</div>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> 
  This is an "Note" callout block of text. 
  This block signifies a general note or tip.
</div>

## Tables

You can build tables with markdown to help you organize information. To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each column’s header, and use pipes (|) to separate each column like in the example below.

| Name | Required | Type | Description |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | Required | `enum` | The type of the model. Must be one of - `page`, `config`, `data`, `object` |
| label | Required | `string` | The label of the model |
| description | | `string` | Description of the model. Used by some CMS. |
| fields | | `list` of `objects` | List of Field Models |
