Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.# create a new Gatsby site using the default starter gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default Start developing. Navigate into your new site's directory and start it up. cd my-default-starter/ gatsby develop Open the source code and start editing! Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! Note: You'll also see a second link: http://localhost:8000/___graphql. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the Gatsby tutorial. Open the my-default-starter directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!🧐 What's inside? A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.. ├── node_modules ├── src ├── .gitignore ├── .prettierrc ├── gatsby-browser.js ├── gatsby-config.js ├── gatsby-node.js ├── gatsby-ssr.js ├── LICENSE ├── package-lock.json ├── package.json └── README.md /node_modules: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed./src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for \"source code\"..gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for..prettierrc: This is a configuration file for Prettier. Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent. gatsby-browser.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby browser APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. gatsby-config.js: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you'd like to include, etc. (Check out the config docs for more detail). gatsby-node.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby Node APIs (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process. gatsby-ssr.js: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the Gatsby server-side rendering APIs (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering. LICENSE: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license. package-lock.json (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won't change this file directly). package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project. README.md: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.🎓 Learning Gatsby Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website. Here are some places to start: For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process. To dive straight into code samples, head to our documentation. In particular, check out the Guides, API Reference, and Advanced Tutorials sections in the sidebar.💫 Deploy Codebase bryan@LAPTOP-9LGJ3JGS:/c/MY-WEB-DEV/BLOG____2.0/BLOG_2.0/src$ tree -f . ├──

                  "AJAX and APIs AJAX and APIs – React Excerpt A JavaScript library for building user interfaces How can I make an AJAX call? You can use any AJAX library you like with React. Some popular ones are Axios, jQuery AJAX, and the browser built-in window.fetch. Where in the component lifecycle should I make an AJAX call? You should populate data with AJAX calls in the componentDidMount lifecycle method. This is so you can use setState to update your component when the data is retrieved. Example: Using AJAX results to set local state The component below demonstrates how to make an AJAX call in componentDidMount to populate local component state. The example API returns a JSON object like this:{ \"items\": [ { \"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Apples\", \"price\": \"$2\" }, { \"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Peaches\", \"price\": \"$5\" } ] } class MyComponent extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { error: null, isLoaded: false, items: [] }; } componentDidMount() { fetch(\"https://api.example.co": 1,

                  "Asynchronous-JS Asynchronous JavaScript Async functions: Let's start with the async keyword. It can be placed before a function, like this: async function f() { return 1; } The word \"async\" before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically. For instance, this function returns a resolved promise with the result of 1; let's test it: async function f() { return 1; } f().then(alert); // 1 ...We could explicitly return a promise, which would be the same: async function f() { return Promise.resolve(1); } f().then(alert); // 1 So, async ensures that the function returns a promise, and wraps non-promises in it. Simple enough, right? But not only that. There's another keyword, await, that works only inside async functions, and it's pretty cool.

Description The await expression causes async function execution to pause until a Promise is settled (that is, fulfilled or rejected), and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment. When resumed, the value of the await expression is that of the fulfilled Promise. If the Promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value. If the value of the expression following the await operator is not a Promise, it's converted to a resolved Promise. An await splits execution flow, allowing the caller of the async function to resume execution. After the await defers the continuation of the async func": 1,

Callstack Visualizer About the Call Stack TL;DR *The Call Stack tracks function calls. It is a LIFO stack of frames. Each frame represents a function call.* The Call Stack is a fundamental part of the JavaScript language. It is a record-keeping structure that allows us to perform function calls. Each function call is represented as a frame on the Call Stack. This is how the JavaScript engine keeps track of which functions have been called and in what order. The JS engine uses this information to ensure execution picks back up in the right spot after a function returns. When a JavaScript program first starts executing, the Call Stack is empty. When the first function call is made, a new frame is pushed onto the top of the Call Stack. When that function returns, its frame is popped off of the Call Stack. About the E": 1,

                  "Close Menu Node Export Module Node.js has a built-in module system. A Node.js file can import functionality exposed by other Node.js files. When you want to import something you use to import the functionality exposed in the library.js file that resides in the current file folder. In this file, functionality must be exposed before it can be imported by other files. Any other object or variable defined in the file by default is private and not exposed to the outer world. This is what the module.exports API offered by the module system allows us to do. When you assign an object or a function as a new exports property, that is the thing that's being exposed, and as such, it can be imported in other parts of your app, or in other apps as well. You can do so in 2 ways. The first is to assign an object to module.exports, which is an object provided out of the box by the module system, and this will make your file export just that object: The second way is to add the exported object a": 1,

Building apps that run in the browser is a completely different thing than building a Node.js application. Despite the fact that it's always JavaScript, there are some key differences that make the experience radically different. From the perspective of a frontend developer who extensively uses JavaScript, Node.js apps bring with them a huge advantage: the comfort of programming everything - the frontend and the backend - in a single language. You have a huge opportunity because we know how hard it is to fully, deeply learn a programming language, and by using the same language to perform all your work on the web - both on the client and on the server, you're in a unique position of advantage.

For example, consider a file named foo.js: const circle = require('./circle.js'); console.log(`The area of a circle of radius 4 is ${circle.area(4)}`); On the first line, foo.js loads the module circle.js that is in the same directory as foo.js. Here are the contents of circle.js: const { PI } = Math; exports.area = (r) => PI * r ** 2; exports.circumference = (r) => 2 * PI * r; The module circle.js has exported the functions area() and circumference(). Functions and objects are added to the root of a module by specifying additional properties on the special exports object.

For example, any voice assistant detects, authenticates and interprets commands from humans even if it is slow or fast. Our voice tone tends to be different during different times of the day. In the early morning after we get up from bed, we interact with a slower, heavier and lazier tone compared to other times of the day. These devices treat the signals as time series and compare the peaks, troughs and slopes by taking into account the varying lags and phases in the signals to come up with a similarity score. One of the most common algorithms used to accomplish this is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). It is a very robust technique to compare two or more Time Series by ignoring any shifts a": 1,

                  "Embed The Web A short history of embedding A long time ago on the Web, it was popular to use frames to create websites — small parts of a website stored in individual HTML pages. These were embedded in a master document called a frameset, which allowed you to specify the area on the screen that each frame filled, rather like sizing the columns and rows of a table. These were considered the height of coolness in the mid to late 90s, and there was evidence that having a webpage split up into smaller chunks like this was better for download speeds — especially noticeable with network connections being so slow back then. They did however have many problems, which far outweighed any positives as network speeds got faster, so you don't see them being used anymore. A little while later (late 90s, early 2000s), plugin technologies became very popular, such as Java Applets and Flash — these allowed web developers to embed rich content into webpages such as videos and animations, which j": 1,

My contribution was the following analogy: Imagine an enormous speaker, mounted on a pole, playing a repeating sound. The speaker is so large, you can see the cone move back and forth with the sound. Mark a point on the cone, and now rotate the pole. Trace the point from an above-ground view, if the resulting squiggly curve is off-center, then there is frequency corresponding the pole's rotational frequency represented in the sound. Dr Bill Connelly from Australia National University has created an interactive simulation of the analogy. Here, the sound from the speaker is a chord of two tones: just enter their frequency and am": 1,

Microsoft Windows instead uses Windows command prompt, a non-Unix terminal environment. In Windows environments, Git is often packaged as part of higher level GUI applications. GUIs for Git may attempt to abstract and hide the underlying version control system primitives. This can be a great aid for Git beginners to rapidly contribute to a project.
