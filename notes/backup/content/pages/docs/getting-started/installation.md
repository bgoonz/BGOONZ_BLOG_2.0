# installation

 **Note:** This is the demo content for demonstration purpose only. The primary function of this content is to show you what this theme can do. There is a more detailed explanation in the **Getting Started** section.

## Callouts

There are two types of callouts available in this theme, **note** and **important**. To add a callout to your documentation simply add the following `html` code with class `important` or `note`. Like in the example bellow.

### HTML example

Copy the code and modify these blocks according to your needs.

```text
<div class="important">
  <strong>Important:</strong> 
  This is an "Important" callout block of text.
  This block indicates a warning or caution. 
  Use it for an important message. 
</div>
```

```text
<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> 
  This is a "Note" callout block of text. 
  This block signifies a general note.
</div>
```

### Live example

 **Important:** This is an "Important" callout block of text. This block indicates a warning or caution. Use it for an important message.

 **Note:** This is a "Note" callout block of text. This block signifies a general note.

## Code blocks

 **Note:** Code blocks have copy functionality. To copy the code press the grey button located in the right side top corner.

You can create simple code blocks by placing triple backticks ``````````` before and after the code block. To render a code block more readable, we recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks.

```text
```
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```
```

```text
if (condition) {
  code to run if condition is true
} else {
  run some other code instead
}
```

## Tables

You can build tables with markdown to help you organize information. To add a table, use three or more hyphens \(---\) to create each column’s header, and use pipes \(\|\) to separate each column like in the example below.

```text

| Title | Title |
| ------| ----- |
| Text  | Text  |
| Text  | Text  |
```

| Title | Title |
| :--- | :--- |
| Text | Text |
| Text | Text |

 **Note:** Creating tables with hyphens and pipes can be time-consuming. To speed up the process, try using the [Markdown Tables Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).
