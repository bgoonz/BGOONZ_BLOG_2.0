        <h3 id="getting-visual-feedback-in-your-programs">Getting visual feedback in your programs</h3>
        <p>
            The first command we’ll learn in JavaScript is <code>console.log</code>. This command is used to <em>print</em> something onto the screen. As we
            write our first lines of code, we’ll be using <code>console.log</code> frequently as a way to visually see the output of our programs. Let’s write
            our first program:
        </p>
        <pre><code>console.log(&quot;hello world&quot;);
console.log(&quot;how are you?&quot;);</code></pre>
        <p>Executing the program above would print out the following:</p>
        <pre><code>hello world
how are you?</code></pre>
        <p>
            Nothing too ground breaking here, but pay close attention to the exact way we wrote the program. In particular, notice how we lay out the periods,
            parentheses, and quotation marks. We’ll also terminate lines with semicolons (;).
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <em
                    >Depending on how you structure your code, sometimes you’ll be able to omit semicolons at the end of lines. For now, you’ll want to include
                    them just as we do.</em
                >
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>
        <p>
            We refer to the exact arrangement of the symbols, characters, and keywords as <strong>syntax</strong>. These details matter — your computer will
            only be able to “understand” proper JavaScript syntax. A programming language is similar to a spoken language. A spoken language like English has
            grammar rules that we should follow in order to be understood by fellow speakers. In the same way, a programming language like JavaScript has syntax
            rules that we ought to follow!
        </p>
        <p>
            As you write your first lines of code in this new language, you may make many syntax errors. Don’t get frustrated! This is normal — all new
            programmers go through this phase. Every time we recognize an error in our code, we have an opportunity to reinforce your understanding of correct
            syntax. Adopt a growth mindset and learn from your mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, one of the best things about programming is that we can get such immediate feedback from our creations. There is no penalty for making
            a mistake when programming. Write some code, run the code, read the errors, fix the errors, rinse and repeat!
        </p>
        <h3 id="code-comments">Code comments</h3>
        <p>
            Occasionally we’ll want to leave <strong>comments</strong> or notes in our code. Commented lines will be ignored by our computer. This means that we
            can use comments to write plain english or temporarily avoid execution of some JavaScript lines. The proper <em>syntax</em> for writing a comment is
            to begin the line with double forward slashes (<code>//</code>):
        </p>
        <pre><code>// let&#39;s write another program!!!
console.log(&quot;hello world&quot;);

// console.log(&quot;how are you?&quot;);

console.log(&quot;goodbye moon&quot;);</code></pre>
        <p>The program above would only print:</p>
        <pre><code>hello world
goodbye moon</code></pre>
        <p>
            Comments are useful when annotating pieces of code to offer an explanation of how the code works. We’ll want to strive to write straightforward code
            that is self-explanatory when possible, but we can also use comments to add additional clarity. The real art of programming is to write code so
            elegantly that it is easy to follow.

        <p><strong>The Number Data Type</strong></p>
        <p>The <strong>number</strong> data type in JS is used to represent any numerical values, including integers and decimal numbers.</p>

        <p><strong>The Boolean Data Type</strong></p>

                    the statement.<br />

        <p><strong>Comparison Operators</strong></p>
        <p>All comparison operators will result in a boolean output.</p>
        <p><strong>The relative comparators</strong></p>
        <ul>

            <li>
                <span id="0437"><strong>&lt;</strong> (less than)</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="17ff"><strong>&gt;=</strong> (greater than or equal to)</span>
            </li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Fun Fact: “a” &lt; “b” is considered valid JS Code because string comparisons are compared lexicographically (meaning dictionary order), so “a” is
            less than “b” because it appears earlier!
        </p>
        <p>If there is ever a standstill comparison of two string lexicographically (i.e. app vs apple) the comparison will deem the shorter string lesser.</p>
        <p><strong>Difference between == and ===</strong></p>
        <h4 id="section">===</h4>
        <p>Strict Equality, will only return true if the two comparisons are entirely the same.</p>
        <h4 id="section-1">==</h4>
        <p>Loose Equality, will return true even if the values are of a different type, due to coercion. (Avoid using this)</p>

        <h3 id="including-comments">Including Comments</h3>
        <p>
            Comments are important because they help other people understand what is going on in your code or remind you if you forgot something yourself. Keep
            in mind that they have to be marked properly so the browser won’t try to execute them.
        </p>
        <p>In JavaScript you have two different options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span id="356d">Single-line comments — To include a comment that is limited to a single line, precede it with <code>//</code></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="ee3a"
                    >Multi-line comments — In case you want to write longer comments between several lines, wrap it in <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> to
                    avoid it from being executed</span
                >
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="variables-in-javascript">Variables in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Variables are stand-in values that you can use to perform operations. You should be familiar with them from math class.</p>
        <h3 id="var-const-let">var, const, let</h3>
        <p>You have three different possibilities for declaring a variable in JavaScript, each with their own specialties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span id="4b29"
                    ><code>var</code> — The most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with
                    <code>var</code> move to the top when the code is executed.</span
                >
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="d234"><code>const</code> — Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="0e3b"><code>let</code> — Similar to <code>const</code>, the <code>let</code> variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="data-types">Data Types</h3>
        <p>Variables can contain different types of values and data types. You use <code>=</code> to assign them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span id="b276">Numbers — <code>var age = 23</code></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="5571">Variables — <code>var x</code></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="e26c">Text (strings) — <code>var a = "init"</code></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="1312">Operations — <code>var b = 1 + 2 + 3</code></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="9880">True or false statements — <code>var c = true</code></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="335a">Constant numbers — <code>const PI = 3.14</code></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="7221">Objects — <code>var name = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"}</code></span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are more possibilities. Note that variables are case sensitive. That means <code>lastname</code> and <code>lastName</code> will be handled as
            two different variables.
        </p>
        <h3 id="objects">Objects</h3>
        <p>
            Objects are certain kinds of variables. They are variables that can have their own values and methods. The latter are actions that you can perform
            on objects.
        </p>
        <p>var person = {</p>
        <p>firstName:”John”,</p>
        <p>lastName:”Doe”,</p>
        <p>age:20,</p>
        <p>nationality:”German”</p>
        <p>};</p>
        <h3 id="the-next-level-arrays">The Next Level: Arrays</h3>
        <p>
            Next up in our JavaScript cheat sheet are arrays. Arrays are part of many different programming languages. They are a way of organizing variables
            and properties into groups. Here’s how to create one in JavaScript:
        </p>
        <p>var fruit = [“Banana”, “Apple”, “Pear”];</p>
        <p>Now you have an array called <code>fruit</code> which contains three items that you can use for future operations.</p>
        <h3 id="array-methods">Array Methods</h3>
        <p>Once you have created arrays, there are a few things you can do with them:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>
        <p>If you have variables, you can use them to perform different kinds of operations. To do so, you need operators.</p>
        <h3 id="basic-operators">Basic Operators</h3>

        <h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
        <p>JavaScript functions are blocks of code that perform a certain task. A basic function looks like this:</p>
        <p>function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {</p>
        <p>// what the function does</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>
            As you can see, it consists of the <code>function</code> keyword plus a name. The function’s parameters are in the brackets and you have curly
            brackets around what the function performs. You can create your own, but to make your life easier – there are also a number of default functions.
        </p>
        <h3 id="outputting-data">Outputting Data</h3>
        <p>A common application for functions is the output of data. For the output, you have the following options:</p>

        <h3 id="if-else-statements">If — Else Statements</h3>
        <p>
            These types of statements are easy to understand. Using them, you can set conditions for when your code is executed. If certain conditions apply,
            something is done, if not — something else is executed.
        </p>
        <p>if (condition) {</p>
        <p>// what to do if condition is met</p>
        <p>} <strong>else</strong> {</p>
        <p>// what to do if condition is not met</p>
        <p>}</p>
        <p>
            A similar concept to <code>if else</code> is the <code>switch</code> statement. However, using the switch you select one of several code blocks to
            execute.

        <h3 id="strings">Strings</h3>
        <p>Strings are what JavaScript calls to text that does not perform a function but can appear on the screen.</p>
        <p>var person = “John Doe”;</p>
        <p>In this case, <code>John Doe</code> is the string.</p>
        <h3 id="escape-characters">Escape Characters</h3>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, strings are marked with single or double-quotes. If you want to use quotation marks in a string, you need to use special characters:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span id="b4b1"><code>\'</code> — Single quote</span>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Aside from that you also have additional escape characters:</p>

        <p>Destructuring assignment makes it easy to work with functions that return arrays of values:</p>
        <p><code>let [r,theta] = toPolar(1.0, 1.0);</code></p>
        <pre><code>function toPolar(x, y) {

return [Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y), Math.atan2(y,x)];

}</code></pre>
        <p>Variable destructuring in loops:</p>
        <p><code>let o = { x: 1, y: 2 };</code></p>
        <pre><code>for(const [name, value] of Object.entries(o)) {

console.log(name, value); // Prints &quot;x 1&quot; and &quot;y 2&quot;

}</code></pre>
        <p>
            <strong>Note</strong>: The <code>Object.entries()</code> method returns an array of a given object’s own enumerable string-keyed property
            <code>[key, value]</code> pairs, in the same order as that provided by a <code>for...in</code> loop. (The only important difference is that a
            <code>for...in</code> loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well).
        </p>
        <p>The list of variables on the left can include extra commas to skip certain values on the right</p>
        <p><code>[,x,,y] = [1,2,3,4];</code></p>
        <p>x == 2; y == 4</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: the last comma does not stand for a value.</p>
        <p>
            To collect all unused or remaining values into a single variable when destructuring an array, use three dots <code>(...)</code>before the last
            variable name on the left-hand side
        </p>
        <p><code>let [x, ...y] = [1,2,3,4];</code></p>
        <p>y == [2,3,4]</p>
        <p><code>let [first, ...rest] = "Hello";</code></p>
        <p>first == “H”; rest ==[“e”,”l”,”l”,”o”]</p>
        <p>Destructuring assignment can also be performed when the righthand side is an object value.</p>
        <p><code>let transparent = {r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0};</code></p>

        <h3 id="expressions-and-operators">Expressions and Operators</h3>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, the values <code>null</code>and <code>undefined</code>are the only two values that do not have properties. In a regular property
            access expression using . or [], you get a <code>TypeError</code> if the expression on the left evaluates to <code>null</code>or
            <code>undefined</code>. You can use <code>?.</code> and <code>?.[]</code> syntax to guard against errors of this type.
        </p>
        <p>You can also invoke a function using <code>?.()</code> instead of <code>()</code>.</p>
        <p>
            With the <code>new ?.()</code> invocation syntax, if the expression to the left of the <code>?.</code> evaluates to <code>null</code> or
            <code>undefined</code>, then the entire invocation expression evaluates to <code>undefined</code>and no exception is thrown.
        </p>
        <p>Write the function invocation using <code>?.(),</code> knowing that invocation will only happen if there is actually a value to be invoked</p>
        <pre><code>function square(x, log) {

log?.(x); // Call the function if there is one

return x * x;

}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Note that expression <code>x++</code> is not always the same as <code>x = x + 1</code>.The <code>++</code> operator never performs string
            concatenation: it always converts its operand to a number and increments it. If x is the string “1”, <code>++x</code> is the number 2, but<code
                >x + 1</code
            >
            is the string “11”.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript objects are compared by reference, not by value. An object is equal to itself, but not to any other object. If two distinct objects have
            the same number of properties, with the same names and values, they are still not equal. Similarly, two arrays that have the same elements in the
            same order are not equal to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>NaN</code>value is never equal to any other value, including itself! To check whether a value <code>x</code> is <code>NaN</code>, use
            <code>x !==</code>, or the global <code>isNaN()</code> function.
        </p>
        <p>
            If both values refer to the same object, array, or function, they are equal. If they refer to different objects, they are not equal, even if both
            objects have identical properties.
        </p>
        <h3 id="evaluating-expressions">Evaluating Expressions</h3>
        <p>JavaScript has the ability to interpret strings of JavaScript source code, evaluating them to produce a value.</p>
        <p><code>eval("3+2")</code></p>
        <p>Because of security issues, some web servers use the HTTP “Content-Security-Policy” header to disable<code>eval()</code> for an entire website.</p>
        <h3 id="first-defined">First-Defined (??)</h3>
        <p>
            The first-defined operator <code>??</code> evaluates to its first defined operand: if its left operand is not <code>null</code> and not
            <code>undefined</code>, it returns that value.
        </p>
        <p><code>a ?? b</code> is equivalent to <code>(a !== null &amp;&amp; a !== undefined) ? a : b</code></p>
        <p>
            <code>??</code> is a useful alternative to <code>||.</code> The problem with this idiomatic use is that zero, the empty string, and false are all
            <code>falsy</code>values that may be perfectly valid in some circumstances. In this code example, if <code>maxWidth</code>is zero, that value will
            be ignored. But if we change the <code>||</code> operator to <code>??</code>, we end up with an expression where zero is a valid value.
        </p>
        <p><code>let max = maxWidth || preferences.maxWidth || 500;</code></p>
        <p><code>let max = maxWidth ?? preferences.maxWidth ?? 500;</code></p>
        <h3 id="delete-operator">delete Operator</h3>
        <p>Deleting an array element leaves a “hole” in the array and does not change the array’s length. The resulting array is sparse.</p>
        <h3 id="void-operator">void Operator</h3>
        <p>Using the <code>void</code> operator makes sense only if the operand has side effects.</p>
        <p><code>let counter = 0;</code></p>
        <p><code>const increment = () =&gt; void counter++;</code></p>
        <p><code>increment()</code></p>
        <p>undefined</p>
        <p><code>counter</code></p>
        <p>1</p>
        <h3 id="statements">Statements</h3>
        <p>Expressions are evaluated to produce a value, but statements are executed to make something happen.</p>
        <p>
            Expressions with side effects, such as assignments and function invocations, can stand alone as statements, and when used this way are known as
            expression statements.
        </p>
        <p>A similar category of statements are the declaration statements that declare new variables and define new functions.</p>
        <p>
            If a function does not have any side effects, there is no sense in calling it, unless it is part of a larger expression or an assignment statement.
        </p>
        <h3 id="forof">for/of</h3>
        <p>The <code>for/of</code> loop works with iterable objects. Arrays, strings, sets, and maps are iterable.</p>

        <p>Objects are not (by default) iterable. Attempting to use <code>for/of</code> on a regular object throws a <code>TypeError</code> at runtime.</p>
        <p>If you want to iterate through the properties of an object, you can use the <code>for/in</code> loop.</p>
        <p>
            Note: <code>for/of</code> can be used on objects with <code>Object.entries</code> property, but it will not pick properties from object’s prototype.

        <h3 id="debugger">debugger</h3>
        <p>If a debugger program is available and is running, then an implementation may (but is not required to) perform some kind of debugging action.</p>
        <p>
            In practice, this statement acts like a breakpoint: execution of JavaScript code stops, and you can use the debugger to print variables’ values,
            examine the call stack, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that it is not enough to have a debugger available: the debugger statement won’t start the debugger for you. If you’re using a web browser and
            have the developer tools console open, however, this statement will cause a breakpoint.
        </p>
        <h3 id="use-strict">use strict</h3>
        <p>
            Strict mode is a restricted subset of the language that fixes important language deficiencies and provides stronger error checking and increased
            security.
        </p>
        <p>The differences between strict mode and non-strict mode are the following:</p>
        <p>· The <code>with</code>statement is not allowed in strict mode.</p>
        <p>
            · In strict mode, all variables must be declared: a <code>ReferenceError</code>is thrown if you assign a value to an identifier that is not a
            declared variable, function, function parameter, catch clause parameter, or property of the global object.
        </p>
        <p>· In non-strict mode, this implicitly declares a global variable by adding a new property to the global object.</p>
        <p>
            · In strict mode, functions invoked as functions (rather than as methods) have a <code>this</code>value of undefined. (In non-strict mode, functions
            invoked as functions are always passed the global object as their <code>this</code>value.)
        </p>
        <p>
            · A function is invoked with <code>call()</code>or <code>apply()</code> , the <code>this</code>value is exactly the value passed as the first
            argument to <code>call()</code> or <code>apply()</code>. (In non-strict mode, <code>null</code>and <code>undefined</code>values are replaced with
            the global object and non-object values are converted to objects.)
        </p>
        <p>
            · In strict mode, assignments to non-writable properties and attempts to create new properties on non-extensible objects throw a
            <code>TypeError</code>. (In non-strict mode, these attempts fail silently.)
        </p>
        <p>
            · In strict mode, code passed to <code>eval()</code>cannot declare variables or define functions in the caller’s scope as it can in non-strict mode.
            Instead, variable and function definitions live in a new scope created for the <code>eval()</code>. This scope is discarded when the
            <code>eval()</code> returns.
        </p>
        <p>
            · In strict mode, the Arguments object in a function holds a static copy of the values passed to the function. In non-strict mode, the Arguments
            object has “magical” behavior in which elements of the array and named function parameters both refer to the same value.
        </p>
        <p>
            · In strict mode, a <code>SyntaxError</code>is thrown if the <code>delete</code>operator is followed by an unqualified identifier such as a
            variable, function, or function parameter. (In non-strict mode, such a <code>delete</code>expression does nothing and evaluates to false.)
        </p>
        <p>
            · In strict mode, an attempt to delete a non-configurable property throws a <code>TypeError</code>. (In non-strict mode, the attempt fails and the
            delete expression evaluates to false.)
        </p>
        <p>
            · In strict mode, it is a syntax error for an object literal to define two or more properties by the same name. (In non-strict mode, no error
            occurs.)
        </p>
        <h3 id="objects-1">Objects</h3>
        <p>In addition to its name and value, each property has three property attributes:</p>
        <p>· The <code>writable</code>attribute specifies whether the value of the property can be set.</p>
        <p>· The <code>enumerable</code>attribute specifies whether the property name is returned by a <code>for/in</code> loop.</p>
        <p>· The <code>configurable</code>attribute specifies whether the property can be deleted and whether its attributes can be altered.</p>
        <h3 id="prototypes">Prototypes</h3>
        <p>All objects created by object literals have the same prototype object, <code>Object.prototype.</code></p>
        <p>
            Objects created using the <code>new</code>keyword and a constructor invocation use the value of the prototype property of the constructor function
            as their prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
            Object created by <code>new Object()</code> inherits from <code>Object.prototype</code>, just as the object created by <code>{}</code> does.
            Similarly, the object created by <code>new Array()</code> uses <code>Array.prototype</code> as its prototype, and the object created by<code
                >new Date()</code
            >
            uses <code>Date.prototype</code> as its prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost all objects have a prototype, but only a relatively small number of objects have a <code>prototype</code>property. It is these objects with
            prototype properties that define the prototypes for all the other objects.
        </p>
        <p>Most built-in constructors (and most user-defined constructors) have a prototype that inherits from <code>Object.prototype</code>.</p>
        <p>
            <code>Date.prototype</code> inherits properties from <code>Object.prototype</code>, so a Date object created by <code>new Date()</code> inherits
            properties from both <code>Date.prototype</code> and <code>Object.prototype</code>. This linked series of prototype objects is known as a prototype
            chain.

        </p>
        <p><code>delete</code> does not remove properties that have a <code>configurable</code>attribute of false.</p>
        <p>
            Certain properties of built-in objects are non-configurable, as are properties of the global object created by variable declaration and function
            declaration.

        <p>
            Advantage of using in: <code>in</code> can distinguish between properties that do not exist and properties that exist but have been set to

        <p>Functions you can use to get an array of property names</p>

        <p>
            When the <code>Array()</code> constructor function is invoked with one numeric argument, it uses that argument as an array length. But when invoked
            with more than one numeric argument, it treats those arguments as elements for the array to be created. This means that the
            <code>Array()</code> constructor cannot be used to create an array with a single numeric element.
        </p>
        <p><code>Array.of()</code></p>

        <h3 id="array.from">Array.from()</h3>
        <p>It is also a simple way to make a copy of an array:</p>
        <p><code>let copy = Array.from(original);</code></p>
        <p>
            <code>Array.from()</code> is also important because it defines a way to make a true-array copy of an array-like object. Array-like objects are
            non-array objects that have a numeric length property and have values stored with properties whose names happen to be integers.
        </p>
        <p><code>let truearray = Array.from(arraylike);</code></p>
        <p>
            <code>Array.from()</code> also accepts an optional second argument. If you pass a function as the second argument, then as the new array is being
            built, each element from the source object will be passed to the function you specify, and the return value of the function will be stored in the
            array instead of the original value.
        </p>
        <h3 id="reading-and-writing-array-elements">Reading and Writing Array Elements</h3>
        <p>
            What is special about arrays is that when you use property names that are non-negative integers , the array automatically maintains the value of the
            <code>length</code> property for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript converts the numeric array index you specify to a string — the index 1 becomes the string “1”, then uses that string as a property name.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is helpful to clearly distinguish an array index from an object property name. All indexes are property names, but only property names that are
            integers between 0 and 231 are indexes. All arrays are objects, and you can create properties of any name on them. If you use properties that are
            array indexes, however, arrays have the special behavior of updating their <code>length</code> property as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that you can index an array using numbers that are negative or that are not integers. When you do this, the number is converted to a string,
            and that string is used as the property name. Since the name is not a non-negative integer, it is treated as a regular object property, not an array
            index.
        </p>
        <p><code>a[-1.23] = true;</code></p>
        <p>This creates a property named “-1.23”</p>
        <p><code>a["1000"] = 0;</code></p>
        <p>This the 1001st element of the array</p>
        <p><code>a[1.000] = 1;</code></p>
        <p>Array index 1. Same as a[1] = 1;</p>
        <p>
            The fact that array indexes are simply a special type of object property name means that JavaScript arrays have no notion of an “out of bounds”
            error. When you try to query a nonexistent property of any object, you don’t get an error; you simply get <code>undefined</code>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sparse-arrays">Sparse Arrays</h3>
        <p>
            Sparse arrays can be created with the <code>Array()</code> constructor or simply by assigning to an array index larger than the current array
            length.
        </p>
        <p><code>a[1000] = 0;</code></p>
        <p>Assignment adds one element but sets length to 1001.</p>
        <p>you can also make an array sparse with the <code>delete</code> operator.</p>
        <p>
            Note that when you omit a value in an array literal (using repeated commas as in <code>[1,,3]</code>), the resulting array is sparse, and the
            omitted elements simply do not exist
        </p>
        <h3 id="array-length">Array Length</h3>
        <p>
            if you set the length property to a nonnegative integer <code>n</code> smaller than its current value, any array elements whose index is greater
            than or equal to n are deleted from the array.
        </p>
        <p><code>a = [1,2,3,4,5];</code></p>
        <p><code>a.length = 3;</code></p>
        <p>a is now [1,2,3].</p>
        <p><code>a.length = 0;</code></p>
        <p>Delete all elements. a is [].</p>
        <p><code>a.length = 5;</code></p>
        <p>Length is 5, but no elements, like <code>new Array(5)</code></p>
        <p>
            You can also set the length property of an array to a value larger than its current value. Doing this does not actually add any new elements to the
            array; it simply creates a sparse area at the end of the array.
        </p>
        <h3 id="adding-and-deleting-array-elements">Adding and Deleting Array Elements</h3>
        <p><code>let a = [];</code></p>
        <p><code>a[0] = "zero";</code></p>
        <p><code>a[1] = "one";</code></p>
        <p>add elements to it.</p>
        <p>You can also use the <code>push()</code> method to add one or more values to the end of an array.</p>
        <p>
            You can use the<code>unshift()</code> method to insert a value at the beginning of an array, shifting the existing array elements to higher indexes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>pop()</code> method is the opposite of <code>push()</code>: it removes the last element of the array and returns it, reducing the length
            of an array by 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, the <code>shift()</code> method removes and returns the first element of the array, reducing the length by 1 and shifting all elements
            down to an index one lower than their current index.
        </p>
        <p>You can delete array elements with the delete operator</p>
        <p><code>let a = [1,2,3];</code></p>
        <p><code>delete a[2];</code></p>
        <p>a now has no element at index 2</p>
        <p><code>2 in a</code></p>
        <p>false</p>
        <p><code>a.length</code></p>
        <p>3: delete does not affect array length</p>
        <h3 id="iterating-arrays">Iterating Arrays</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to loop through each of the elements of an array (or any iterable object) is with the <code>for/of</code>loop</p>
        <pre><code>let letters = [...&quot;Hello world&quot;];

let string = &quot;&quot;;

for(let letter of letters) {

string += letter;

}</code></pre>
        <p>It has no special behavior for sparse arrays and simply returns <code>undefined</code> for any array elements that do not exist.</p>
        <p>
            If you want to use a <code>for/of</code> loop for an array and need to know the index of each array element, use the <code>entries()</code> method
            of the array
        </p>
        <pre><code>let letters = [...&quot;Hello world&quot;];

let everyother = &quot;&quot;;

for(let [index, letter] of letters.entries()) {

if (index % 2 === 0) everyother += letter;

}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Another good way to iterate arrays is with <code>forEach()</code>. This is not a new form of the for loop, but an array method that offers a
            functional approach to array iteration.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let letters = [...&quot;Hello world&quot;];

let uppercase = &quot;&quot;;

letters.forEach(letter =&gt; {

uppercase += letter.toUpperCase();

});</code></pre>
        <p>You can also loop through the elements of an array with a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
        <pre><code>for(let i = 0, len = letters.length; i &lt; len; i++) {

            First, all of these methods accept a function as their first argument and invoke that function once for each element (or some elements) of the

        <p>
            Note that <code>map()</code> returns a new array: it does not modify the array it is invoked on. If that array is sparse, your function will not be
            called for the missing elements, but the returned array will be sparse in the same way as the original array: it will have the same length and the
            same missing elements.
        </p>
        <p>To close the gaps in a sparse array, you can do this:</p>
        <p><code>let dense = sparse.filter(() =&gt; true);</code></p>
        <p>And to close gaps and remove undefined and null elements, you can use filter, like this:</p>
        <p><code>a = a.filter(x =&gt; x !== undefined &amp;&amp; x !== null);</code></p>
        <p>
            Unlike <code>filter()</code>, however,<code>find()</code> and <code>findIndex()</code> stop iterating the first time the predicate finds an element.
            When that happens, <code>find()</code> returns the matching element, and <code>findIndex()</code> returns the index of the matching element. If no
            matching element is found,<code>find()</code> returns <code>undefined</code> and<code>findIndex()</code>returns -1.
        </p>
        <p>When you invoke <code>reduce()</code> with no initial value, it uses the first element of the array as the initial value.</p>
        <p>
            <code>reduceRight()</code> works just like <code>reduce()</code>, except that it processes the array from highest index to lowest (right-to-left),
            rather than from lowest to highest. You might want to do this if the reduction operation has right-to-left associativity

        <p>
            The <code>push()</code> and<code>pop()</code> methods allow you to work with arrays as if they were stacks. The <code>push()</code> method appends
            one or more new elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>unshift()</code> and <code>shift()</code> methods behave much like <code>push()</code> and<code>pop()</code>, except that they insert and
            remove elements from the beginning of an array rather than from the end.
        </p>
        <p>

            <code>splice()</code> is a general-purpose method for inserting or removing elements from an array.<code>splice()</code> can delete elements from an
            array, insert new elements into an array, or perform both operations at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first argument to <code>splice()</code> specifies the array position at which the insertion and/or deletion is to begin. The second argument
            specifies the number of elements that should be deleted from (spliced out of) the array.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike <code>concat(), splice()</code> inserts arrays themselves, not the elements of those arrays.</p>

            <code>indexOf()</code> and <code>lastIndexOf()</code> compare their argument to the array elements using the equivalent of the === operator. If your
            array contains objects instead of primitive values, these methods check to see if two references both refer to exactly the same object. If you want
            to actually look at the content of an object, try using the <code>find()</code> method with your own custom predicate function instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>indexOf()</code> and <code>lastIndexOf()</code> take an optional second argument that specifies the array index at which to begin the search.
            Negative values are allowed for the second argument and are treated as an offset from the end of the array.
        </p>
        <p><code>indexOf()</code> will not detect the NaN value in an array, but <code>includes()</code> will</p>
        <p>
            When <code>sort()</code> is called with no arguments, it sorts the array elements in alphabetical order. To sort an array into some order other than
            alphabetical, you must pass a comparison function as an argument to <code>sort()</code>.

        <h3 id="functions-as-namespaces">Functions as Namespaces</h3>
        <p>
            Variables declared within a function are not visible outside of the function. For this reason, it is sometimes useful to define a function simply to
            act as a temporary namespace in which you can define variables without cluttering the global namespace.
        </p>
        <p>
            Variables that would have been global become local to the function. Following code defines only a single global variable: the function name
            <code>chunkNamespace</code>.
        </p>
        <pre><code>function chunkNamespace() {

// Chunk of code goes here

// Any variables defined in the chunk are local to this function

// instead of cluttering up the global namespace.

}

chunkNamespace();</code></pre>
        <p>
            If defining even a single property is too much, you can define and invoke an anonymous function in a single expression — IIEF (immediately invoked
            function expression)

        <pre><code>(function() {

// chunkNamespace() function rewritten as an unnamed expression.

}());</code></pre>
        <h3 id="closures">Closures</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript uses lexical scoping. This means that functions are executed using the variable scope that was in effect when they were defined, not the
            variable scope that is in effect when they are invoked.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to implement lexical scoping, the internal state of a JavaScript function object must include not only the code of the function but also a
            reference to the scope in which the function definition appears.
        </p>
        <p>
            This combination of a function object and a scope (a set of variable bindings) in which the function’s variables are resolved is called a closure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Closures become interesting when they are invoked from a different scope than the one they were defined in. This happens most commonly when a nested
            function object is returned from the function within which it was defined.

        <h3 id="the-length-property">The length Property</h3>
        <p>
            The read-only length property of a function specifies the arity of the function — the number of parameters it declares in its parameter list, which
            is usually the number of arguments that the function expects.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-name-property">The name Property</h3>
        <p>This property is primarily useful when writing debugging or error messages.</p>
        <h3 id="the-prototype-property">The prototype Property</h3>
        <p>When a function is used as a constructor, the newly created object inherits properties from the prototype object.</p>
        <h3 id="the-call-and-apply-methods">The call() and apply() Methods</h3>
        <p>
            <code>call()</code> and <code>apply()</code> allow you to indirectly invoke a function as if it were a method of some other object. The first
            argument to both <code>call()</code> and <code>apply()</code> is the object on which the function is to be invoked; this argument is the invocation
            context and becomes the value of the <code>this</code> keyword within the body of the function.
        </p>
        <p>To invoke the function<code>f()</code> as a method of the object o (passing no arguments),</p>
        <p><code>f.call(o);</code></p>
        <p><code>f.apply(o);</code></p>
        <p>To pass two numbers to the function <code>f()</code> and invoke it as if it were a method of the object o,</p>
        <pre><code>f.call(o, 1, 2);</code></pre>
        <p>
            The <code>apply()</code> method is like the <code>call()</code> method, except that the arguments to be passed to the function are specified as an
            array:
        </p>
        <pre><code>f.apply(o, [1,2]);</code></pre>
        <p>
            The <code>trace()</code>function defined uses the <code>apply()</code>method instead of a spread operator, and by doing that, it is able to invoke
            the wrapped method with the same arguments and the same this value as the wrapper method
        </p>
        <pre><code>function trace(o, m) {

let original = o[m];

o[m] = function(...args) {

        <h3 id="the-bind-method">The bind() Method</h3>
        <p>The primary purpose of <code>bind()</code> is to bind a function to an object.</p>

        <p><code>let o = { x: 1 };</code></p>

        <p>3 // g is still bound to o, not p.</p>
        <p>The most common use case for calling <code>bind()</code> is to make non-arrow functions behave like arrow functions.</p>
        <p>Partial application is a common technique in functional programming and is sometimes called <code>currying</code>.</p>

        <h3 id="classes-and-constructors">Classes and Constructors</h3>
        <p>A constructor is a function designed for the initialization of newly created objects.</p>
        <p>
            The critical feature of constructor invocations is that the <code>prototype</code> property of the constructor is used as the prototype of the new
            object.
        </p>
        <p>
            While almost all objects have a prototype, only a few objects have a <code>prototype</code> property. It is function objects that have a
            <code>prototype</code> property.
        </p>
        <p>This means that all objects created with the same constructor function inherit from the same object and are therefore members of the same class.</p>
        <p>A Range class using a constructor</p>
        <pre><code>function Range(from, to) {

this.from = from;

this.to = to;

}

Range.prototype = {

includes: function(x) { return this.from &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= this.to; },

[Symbol.iterator]: function*() {

for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x &lt;= this.to; x++)

yield x;

},

toString: function() { return &quot;(&quot; + this.from + &quot;...&quot; + this.to + &quot;)&quot;; }

};</code></pre>
        <p><code>let r = new Range(1,3);</code></p>
        <p><code>r.includes(2)</code></p>
        <p>true</p>
        <p><code>r.toString()</code></p>
        <p>“(1…3)”</p>
        <p><code>[...r]</code></p>
        <p>[1, 2, 3]</p>
        <p>
            Because the <code>Range()</code>constructor is invoked with <code>new</code>, it does not have to call <code>Object.create()</code> or take any
            action to create a new object.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first example, the prototype was <code>range.methods</code>. This was a convenient and descriptive name, but arbitrary. In the second
            example, the prototype is <code>Range.prototype</code>, and this name is mandatory.
        </p>
        <p>
            An invocation of the <code>Range()</code> constructor automatically uses <code>Range.prototype</code> as the prototype of the
            <code>new Range</code> object.
        </p>
        <h3 id="constructors-class-identity-and-instanceof">Constructors, Class Identity, and instanceof</h3>
        <p>Two objects are instances of the same class if and only if they inherit from the same prototype object.</p>
        <p>
            The <code>instanceof</code> operator is not checking whether <code>r</code> was actually initialized by the Range constructor. Instead, it is
            checking whether <code>r</code> inherits from <code>Range.prototype</code>.
        </p>
        <pre><code>function Strange() {}

Strange.prototype = Range.prototype;

new Strange() instanceof Range</code></pre>
        <p>true</p>
        <p>
            If you want to test the prototype chain of an object for a specific prototype and do not want to use the constructor function as an intermediary,
            you can use the <code>isPrototypeOf()</code> method
        </p>
        <pre><code>range.methods.isPrototypeOf(r);</code></pre>
        <h3 id="the-constructor-property">The constructor Property</h3>
        <p>
            Every regular JavaScript function automatically has a <code>prototype</code> property. The value of this property is an object that has a single,
            non-enumerable <code>constructor</code> property.
        </p>
        <p>The value of the <code>constructor</code> property is the function object</p>
        <pre><code>let F = function() {};

let p = F.prototype;

let c = p.constructor;

c === F</code></pre>
        <p>true</p>
        <p><code>let o = new F();</code></p>
        <p><code>o.constructor === F</code></p>
        <p>true</p>
        <p>
            Instances of the Range class, as defined, do not have a constructor property. We can remedy this problem by explicitly adding a constructor to the
            prototype:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Range.prototype = {

constructor: Range

};</code></pre>
        <p>
            Another common technique that you are likely to see in older JavaScript code is to use the predefined prototype object with its constructor property
            and add methods to it one at a time with code like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Range.prototype.includes = function(x) {

return this.from &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= this.to;

};

Range.prototype.toString = function() {

return &quot;(&quot; + this.from + &quot;...&quot; + this.to + &quot;)&quot;;

};</code></pre>

        <pre><code>class Range {

constructor(from, to) {

this.from = from;

includes(x) { return this.from &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt;= this.to; }

for(let x = Math.ceil(this.from); x &lt;= this.to; x++)

        <p><code>let r = new Range(1,3);</code></p>
        <p><code>r.includes(2)</code></p>

        <p>
            Although class bodies are superficially similar to object literals, they are not the same thing. In particular, they do not support the definition
            of properties with name/value pairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your class does not need to do any initialization, you can omit the constructor keyword and its body, and an empty constructor function will be
            implicitly created for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to define a class that subclasses — or inherits from — another class, you can use the <code>extends</code> keyword with the class
            keyword:
        </p>
        <pre><code>class Span extends Range {

constructor(start, length) {

super(start, start + length);

}

        <p>9</p>
        <h3 id="static-methods">Static methods</h3>
        <p>
            You can define a <code>static</code> method within a class body by prefixing the method declaration with the <code>static</code> keyword. Static
            methods are defined as properties of the constructor function rather than properties of the prototype object.
        </p>
        <pre><code>static parse(s) {

        <p>
            The method defined by this code is <code>Range.parse()</code>, not <code>Range.prototype.parse()</code>, and you must invoke it through the
            constructor, not through an instance:

        <h3 id="getters-setters-and-other-method-forms">Getters, Setters, and other Method Forms</h3>
        <p>
            Within a class body, you can define getter and setter methods just as you can in object literals. The only difference is that in class bodies, you
            don’t put a comma after the getter or setter.
        </p>
        <h3 id="public-private-and-static-fields">Public, Private, and Static Fields</h3>
        <p>
            The ES6 standard only allows the creation of methods (including getters, setters, and generators) and static methods; it does not include syntax for
            defining fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to define a field on a class instance, you must do that in the constructor function or in one of the methods. And if you want to define
            a static field for a class, you must do that outside the class body, after the class has been defined.
        </p>
        <p>

            You may not use the <code>this</code> keyword in your constructor until after you have invoked the superclass constructor with <code>super()</code>.

            ES6 modularity is conceptually the same as Node modularity: each file is its own module, and constants, variables, functions, and classes defined
            within a file are private to that module unless they are explicitly exported.
        </p>
        <h3 id="es6-exports">ES6 Exports</h3>
        <p>To export a constant, variable, function, or class from an ES6 module, simply add the keyword export before the declaration</p>
        <pre><code>export const PI = Math.PI;

export function degreesToRadians(d) { return d * PI / 180; }

            It is common to write modules that export only one value (typically a function or class), and in this case, we usually use export

            With the wildcard import shown in the previous example, the importing module would use the imported <code>mean()</code> and<code>stddev()</code>

        <h3 id="the-set-class">The Set Class</h3>
        <p>Sets are not ordered or indexed, and they do not allow duplicates.</p>
        <pre><code>let s = new Set();

let t = new Set([1, s]);

let t = new Set(s);

let unique = new Set(&quot;Mississippi&quot;);</code></pre>
        <p>The argument to the <code>Set()</code> constructor need not be an array: any iterable object (including other Set objects) is allowed.</p>
        <p>
            The <code>add()</code> method takes a single argument; if you pass an array, it adds the array itself to the set, not the individual array elements.
            <code>add()</code> always returns the set it is invoked on, however, so if you want to add multiple values to a set, you can used chained method
            calls like.
        </p>
        <p>it is very important to understand that set membership is based on strict equality checks, like the === operator performs.</p>
        <p>
            The most important thing we do with sets is not to add and remove elements from them, but to check to see whether a specified value is a member of
            the set:
        </p>
        <p><code>let oneDigitPrimes = new Set([2,3,5,7]);</code></p>
        <p><code>oneDigitPrimes.has(2)</code></p>
        <p>The Set class is iterable, which means that you can use a <code>for/of</code> loop to enumerate all of the elements of a set:</p>
        <pre><code>let sum = 0;

for(let p of oneDigitPrimes) {

sum += p; // and add them up

}</code></pre>
        <p>Because Set objects are iterable, you can convert them to arrays and argument lists with the … spread operator</p>
        <p><code>[...oneDigitPrimes]</code></p>
        <p>
            JavaScript Set class always remembers the order that elements were inserted in, and it always uses this order when you iterate a set: the first
            element inserted will be the first one iterated (assuming you haven’t deleted it first), and the most recently inserted element will be the last one
            iterated.
        </p>
        <p>Set class also implements a <code>forEach()</code> method</p>

        <p>map is a set of keys, each of which has an associated value. This is not quite the same as a set of key/value pairs.</p>
        <p>
            use <code>has()</code> to check whether a map includes the specified key; use <code>delete()</code> to remove a key (and its associated value) from
            the map; use <code>clear()</code> to remove all key/value pairs from the map; and use the size property to find out how many keys a map contains.
        </p>
        <p><code>set()</code> method of Map can be chained.</p>
        <p>
            Any JavaScript value can be used as a key or a value in a Map. This includes<code>null, undefined</code>, and <code>NaN</code>, as well as reference

        <p>
            If you want to iterate just the keys or just the associated values of a map, use the <code>keys()</code> and <code>values()</code> methods: these
            return iterable objects that iterate keys and values, in insertion order. (The<br />
             <code>entries()</code> method returns an iterable object that iterates key/value pairs, but this is exactly the same as iterating the map
            directly.)

        <pre><code>[...m.keys()]

        <p>
            The <code>WeakMap</code>class is a variant (but not an actual subclass) of the Map class that does not prevent its key values from being garbage
            collected.
        </p>
        <p><code>WeakMap</code>keys must be objects or arrays; primitive values are not subject to garbage collection and cannot be used as keys.</p>
        <p>
            WeakMap implements only the<code>get(), set(), has(),</code> and <code>delete()</code> methods. In particular, <code>WeakMap</code> is not iterable
            and does not define <code>keys(), values(),</code> or <code>forEach()</code>. If WeakMap was iterable, then its keys would be reachable and it
            wouldn’t be weak.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, WeakMap does not implement the size property because the <code>size</code> of a WeakMap could change at any time as objects are garbage

        <h3 id="typed-arrays-and-binary-data">Typed Arrays and Binary Data</h3>
        <p>They differ from regular arrays in some very important ways</p>
        <p>
            · The elements of a typed array are all numbers. Unlike regular JavaScript numbers, however, typed arrays allow you to specify the type (signed and
            unsigned integers and IEEE-754 floating point) and size (8 bits to 64 bits) of the numbers to be stored in the array.
        </p>
        <p>· You must specify the length of a typed array when you create it, and that length can never change.</p>
        <p>· The elements of a typed array are always initialized to 0 when the array is created.</p>

        <pre><code>let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1024*1024);

buffer.byteLength</code></pre>
        <p>1024*1024</p>
        <p>Typed arrays are not true arrays, but they re-implement most array methods, so you can use them pretty much just like you’d use regular arrays:</p>
        <p><code>let ints = new Int16Array(10);</code></p>
        <p>10 short integers</p>
        <p><code>ints.fill(3).map(x=&gt;x*x).join("")</code></p>
        <p>“9999999999”</p>
        <p>
            Remember that typed arrays have fixed lengths, so the length property is read-only, and methods that change the length of the array (such as<code
                >push(), pop(), unshift(), shift(),</code
            >
            and <code>splice()</code>) are not implemented for typed arrays. Methods that alter the contents of an array without changing the length (such as
            <code>sort(), reverse()</code>, and <code>fill()</code>) are implemented.

        <p>If the left alternative matches, the right alternative is ignored, even if it would have produced a “better” match</p>
        <p>
            Another purpose of parentheses in regular expressions is to define subpatterns within the complete pattern. When a regular expression is
            successfully matched against a target string, it is possible to extract the portions of the target string that matched any particular parenthesized
            subpattern. For example, suppose you are looking for one or more lowercase letters followed by one or more digits. You might use the pattern
            <code>/[a-z]+\d+/</code>. But suppose you only really care about the digits at the end of each match. If you put that part of the pattern in
            parentheses (/[a-z]+(\d+)/), you can extract the digits from any matches you find,
        </p>
        <p>
            A related use of parenthesized subexpressions is to allow you to refer back to a subexpression later in the same regular expression. This is done by
            following a \ character by a digit or digits. The digits refer to the position of the parenthesized subexpression within the regular expression. For
            example, \1 refers back to the first subexpression, and \3 refers to the third.

        <h3 id="specifying-match-position">SPECIFYING MATCH POSITION</h3>
        <p>
            <em>regular expression anchors</em> because they anchor the pattern to a specific position in the search string. The most commonly used anchor
            elements are ^, which ties the pattern to the beginning of the string, and $, which anchors the pattern to the end of the string.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Pattern</strong></p>
        <p>match the word “JavaScript” on a line by itself</p>
        <p><code>/^JavaScript$/</code></p>
        <p>
            To search for “Java” as a word by itself you can try the pattern <code>/\sJava\s/</code>, which requires a space before and after the word. But
            there are two problems with this solution. First, it does not match “Java” at the beginning or the end of a string, but only if it appears with
            space on either side. Second, when this pattern does find a match, the matched string it returns has leading and trailing spaces, which is not quite
            what’s needed. So instead of matching actual space characters with \s, match (or anchor to) word boundaries with \b. The resulting expression is
            <code>/\bJava\b/</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The element <code>\B</code> anchors the match to a location that is not a word boundary. Thus, the pattern <code>/\B[Ss]cript/</code> matches
            “JavaScript” and “postscript”, but not “script” or “Scripting”.
        </p>
        <p>You can also use arbitrary regular expressions as anchor conditions.</p>
        <p>
            If you include an expression within <code>(?= and )</code> characters, it is a lookahead assertion, and it specifies that the enclosed characters
            must match, without actually matching them.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Pattern</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Matches</strong></p>
        <p>to match the name of a common programming language, but only if it is followed by a colon</p>
        <p><code>/[Jj]ava([Ss]cript)?(?=\:)/</code></p>
        <p>matches the word “JavaScript” in “JavaScript: The DefinitiveGuide”</p>
        <p>does not match “Java” in “Java in a Nutshell”</p>
        <p>If you instead introduce an assertion with <code>(?!</code>, it is a negative lookahead assertion.</p>
        <h3 id="flags">FLAGS</h3>
        <p>
            Flags are specified after the second / character of a regular expression literal or as a string passed as the second argument to the RegExp()

        <p>u</p>

        <p>
            Setting the u flag on a RegExp also allows you to use the new <code>\u{...}</code> escape sequence for Unicode character and also enables the \p{…}
            notation for Unicode character classes.

        <h3 id="search">SEARCH()</h3>
        <p>Strings support four methods that use regular expressions.</p>
        <p><code>"JavaScript".search(/script/ui)</code></p>
        <p>4</p>
        <p><code>"Python".search(/script/ui)</code></p>
        <p>-1</p>
        <p><code>search()</code> does not support global searches; it ignores the <code>g</code> flag of its regular expression argument.</p>
        <p>REPLACE()</p>
        <p><code>text.replace(/javascript/gi, "JavaScript");</code></p>
        <p>No matter how it is capitalized, replace it with the correct capitalization</p>
        <p>
            parenthesized subexpressions of a regular expression are numbered from left to right and that the regular expression remembers the text that each
            subexpression matches.
        </p>
        <p>to replace quotation marks in a string with other characters:</p>
        <p><code>let quote = /"([^"]*)"/g;</code></p>
        <p><code>'He said "stop"'.replace(quote, '«$1»')</code></p>
        <p>‘He said «stop»’</p>
        <p>If your RegExp uses named capture groups, then you can refer to the matching text by name rather than by number:</p>
        <p><code>let quote = /"(?&lt;quotedText&gt;[^"]*)"/g;</code></p>
        <p><code>'He said "stop"'.replace(quote, '«$&lt;quotedText&gt;»')</code></p>
        <p>‘He said «stop»’</p>
        <p>
            Instead of passing a replacement string as the second argument to replace(), you can also pass a function that will be invoked to compute the
            replacement value.
        </p>
        <p>Example to convert decimal integers in a string to hexadecimal:</p>
        <p><code>let s = "15 times 15 is 225";</code></p>
        <p><code>s.replace(/\d+/gu, n =&gt; parseInt(n).toString(16))</code></p>

        <p><code>"7 plus 8 equals 15".match(/\d+/g)</code></p>
        <p>[“7”, “8”, “15”]</p>
        <p>
            If the regular expression does not have the <code>g</code> flag set, <code>match()</code> does not do a global search; it simply searches for the
            first match. In this nonglobal case, <code>match()</code> still returns an array, but the array elements are completely different.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, if <code>match()</code> returns an array a, a[0] contains the complete match, a[1] contains the substring that matched the first parenthesized
            expression, and so on.
        </p>

        <pre><code>path = match[3];</code></pre>
        <p>“~david”</p>
        <p>In this non-global case, the array returned by match() also has some object properties in addition to the numbered array elements.</p>
        <p>input property refers to the string on which match() was called</p>
        <p>The index property is the position within that string at which the match starts.</p>
        <p>if the regular expression contains named capture groups, then the returned array also has a groups property whose value is an object.</p>

        <h3 id="matchall">MATCHALL()</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of returning an array of matching substrings like <code>match()</code> does, however, it returns an iterator that yields the kind of match
            objects that match() returns when used with a non-global RegExp.
        </p>
        <h3 id="split">SPLIT()</h3>
        <p><code>"123,456,789".split(",")</code></p>

        <p><code>"1, 2, 3,\n4, 5".split(/\s*,\s*/)</code></p>
        <p>[“1”, “2”, “3”, “4”,”5"]</p>
        <p>
            Surprisingly, if you call <code>split()</code> with a RegExp delimiter and the regular expression includes capturing groups, then the text that
            matches the capturing groups will be included in the returned array.
        </p>
        <p><code>const htmlTag = /&lt;([^&gt;]+)&gt;/;</code></p>

            The <code>RegExp()</code> constructor is useful when a regular expression is being dynamically created and thus cannot be represented with the

        <h3 id="the-lastindex-property-and-regexp-reuse">THE LASTINDEX PROPERTY AND REGEXP REUSE</h3>
        <p>
            The use of the <code>lastIndex</code> property with the g and y flags is a particularly awkward part of this API. When you use these flags, you need
            to be particularly careful when calling the <code>match(), exec()</code>, or <code>test()</code> methods because the behavior of these methods
            depends on <code>lastIndex</code>, and the value of <code>lastIndex</code> depends on what you have previously done with the RegExp object.
        </p>
        <p>To find the index of all &lt;p&gt; tags within a string of HTML text:</p>
        <pre><code>let match, positions = [];

while((match = /&lt;p&gt;/g.exec(html)) !== null) {

positions.push(match.index);

}</code></pre>
        <p>
            If the html string contains at least one &lt;p&gt; tag, then it will loop forever. For each iteration of the loop, we’re creating a new RegExp
            object with <code>lastIndex</code> set to 0, so <code>exec()</code> always begins at the start of the string, and if there is a match, it will keep
            matching over and over. The solution, of course, is to define the RegExp once, and save it to a variable so that we’re using the same RegExp object
            for each iteration of the loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, sometimes reusing a RegExp object is the wrong thing to do. Suppose, for example, that we want to loop through all of the words
            in a dictionary to find words that contain pairs of double letters.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let dictionary = [ &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;book&quot;, &quot;coffee&quot; ];

let doubleLetterWords = [];

let doubleLetter = /(\w)\1/g;

for(let word of dictionary) {

if (doubleLetter.test(word)) {

doubleLetterWords.push(word);

}

}</code></pre>
        <p><code>doubleLetterWords</code></p>
        <p>[“apple”, “coffee”]: “book” is missing!</p>
        <p>
            Because we set the g flag on the RegExp, the <code>lastIndex</code> property is changed after successful matches, and the <code>test()</code> method
            (which is based on <code>exec()</code>) starts searching for a match at the position specified by <code>lastIndex</code>. After matching the “pp” in
            “apple”, <code>lastIndex</code> is 3, and so we start searching the word “book” at position 3 and do not see the “oo” that it contains.

        <p>
            If you print a date (with console.log(century), for example), it will, by default, be printed in your local time zone. If you want to display a date
            in UTC, you should explicitly convert it to a string with <code>toUTCString()</code> or<code>toISOString()</code>.

        <p>
            Once you have a Date object, various get and set methods allow you to query and modify the year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute, second, and
            millisecond fields of the Date. Each of these methods hastwo forms: one that gets or sets using local time and one that gets or sets using UTC time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the methods for querying the day-of-month are <code>getDate()</code> and <code>getUTCDate()</code>. The more natural-sounding functions
            <code>getDay()</code> and <code>getUTCDay()</code> return the day-of-week (0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday). The day-of-week is read-only, so

        <h3 id="error-classes">Error Classes</h3>
        <p>
            One good reason to use an Error object is that, when you create an Error, it captures the state of the JavaScript stack, and if the exception is
            uncaught, the stack trace will be displayed with the error message, which will help you debug the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Error objects have two properties: <code>message</code> and <code>name</code>, and a<code>toString()</code> method. Node and all modern browsers

        <h3 id="json-serialization-and-parsing">JSON Serialization and Parsing</h3>
        <p>JavaScript supports JSON serialization and deserialization with the two functions <code>JSON.stringify()</code> and <code>JSON.parse().</code></p>
        <pre><code>let o = {s: &quot;&quot;, n: 0, a: [true, false, null]};

let s = JSON.stringify(o);</code></pre>
        <p>s == ‘{“s”:””,”n”:0,”a”:[true,false,null]}’</p>
        <pre><code>let copy = JSON.parse(s);</code></pre>
        <p>copy == {s: “”, n: 0, a:[true, false, null]}</p>
        <p>Inefficient way of creating a deep copy of an object</p>
        <pre><code>function deepcopy(o) {

return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o));

}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Typically, you pass only a single argument to <code>JSON.stringify()</code> and <code>JSON.parse()</code>. Both functions accept an optional second
            argument that allows us to extend the JSON format.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>JSON.stringify()</code> also takes an optional third argument. If you would like your JSONformatted string to be human-readable (if it is
            being used as a configuration file, for example), then you should pass null as the second argument and pass a number or string as the third
            argument. If the third argument is a number, then it will use that number of spaces for each indentation level. If the third argument is a string of
            whitespace (such as ‘\t’), it will use that string for each level of indent.
        </p>
        <h3 id="json-customizations">JSON Customizations</h3>
        <p>
            If <code>JSON.stringify()</code> is asked to serialize a value that is not natively supported by the JSON format, it looks to see if that value has
            a <code>toJSON()</code> method, and if so, it calls that method and then stringifies the return value in place of the original value. Date objects
            implement <code>toJSON()</code>: it returns the same string that <code>toISOString()</code> method does.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need to re-create Date objects (or modify the parsed object inany other way), you can pass a “reviver” function as the second argument to
            <code>JSON.parse()</code>.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let data = JSON.parse(text, function(key, value) {

if (key[0] === &quot;_&quot;) return undefined;

if (typeof value === &quot;string&quot; &amp;&amp; /^\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\dT\d\d:\d\d:\d\d.\d\d\dZ$/.test(value)) {

        <p>
            Console functions that print their arguments like console.log() have a little-known feature: if the first argument is a string that includes
            <code>%s, %i, %d, %f, %o, %O, or %c</code>, then this first argument is treated as format string, and the values of subsequent arguments are
            substituted into the string in place of the two-character % sequences.

            Often, however, HTTP requests encode the values of multiple form fields or multiple API parameters into the query portion of a URL. In this format,
            the query portion of the URL is a question mark followed by one or more name/value pairs, which are separated from one another by ampersands.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to encode these kinds of name/value pairs into the query portion of a URL, then the searchParams property will be more useful than the

        <h3 id="promises">Promises</h3>
        <p>Promises, a core language feature designed to simplify asynchronous programming.</p>
        <p>
            A Promise is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. That result may or may not be ready yet, and the Promise API is
            intentionally vague about this: there is no way to synchronously get the value of a Promise; you can only ask the Promise to call a callback
            function when the value is ready.
        </p>
        <p>
            One real problem with callback-based asynchronous programming is that it is common to end up with callbacks inside callbacks inside callbacks, with
            lines of code so highly indented that it is difficult to read.
        </p>
        <p>
            Promises allow this kind of nested callback to be re-expressed as a more linear Promise chain that tends to be easier to read and easier to reason
            about.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another problem with callbacks is that they can make handling errors difficult. If an asynchronous function (or an asynchronously invoked callback)
            throws an exception, there is no way for that exception to propagate back to the initiator of the asynchronous operation. This is a fundamental fact
            about asynchronous programming: it breaks exception handling. Promises help here by standardizing a way to handle errors and providing a way for
            errors to propagate correctly through a chain of promises.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that Promises represent the future results of single asynchronous computations. They cannot be used to represent repeated asynchronous
            computations, however.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can’t use Promises to replace <code>setInterval()</code> because that function invokes a callback function repeatedly, which is something that
            Promises are just not designed to do.

        <pre><code>getJSON(url).then(jsonData =&gt; {

// callback function that will be asynchronously invoked with the parsed JSON value when it becomes available.

});</code></pre>
        <p>
            The Promise object defines a then() instance method. Instead of passing our callback function directly to <code>getJSON()</code>, we instead pass it
            to the then() method. When the HTTP response arrives, the body of that response is parsed as JSON, and the resulting parsed value is passed to the
            function that we passed to <code>then()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you call the <code>then()</code> method of a Promise object multiple times, each of the functions you specify will be called when the promised
            computation is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many event listeners, though, a Promise represents a single computation, and each function registered with then() will be invoked only once.
        </p>
        <pre><code>function displayUserProfile(profile) { ...}

getJSON(&quot;/api/user/profile&quot;).then(displayUserProfile);</code></pre>
        <h3 id="handling-errors-with-promises">HANDLING ERRORS WITH PROMISES</h3>
        <p>
            Asynchronous operations, particularly those that involve networking, can typically fail in a number of ways, and robust code has to be written to
            handle the errors that will inevitably occur.
        </p>
        <p><code>getJSON("/api/user/profile").then(displayUserProfile, handleProfileError);</code></p>
        <p>
            if <code>getJSON()</code> runs normally, it passes its result to <code>displayUserProfile()</code>. If there is an error (the user is not logged in,
            the server is down, the user’s internet connection dropped, the request timed out, etc.), then <code>getJSON()</code> passes an Error object to
            <code>handleProfileError()</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, it is rare to see two functions passed to then(). There is a better and more idiomatic way of handling errors when working with
            Promises.
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand it, first consider what happens if <code>getJSON()</code> completes normally but an error occurs in <code>displayUserProfile()</code>.
            That callback function is invoked asynchronously when <code>getJSON()</code> returns, so it is also asynchronous and cannot meaningfully throw an
            exception (because there is no code on the call stack to handle it).
        </p>
        <pre><code>getJSON(&quot;/api/user/profile&quot;).then(displayUserProfile).catch(handleProfileError);</code></pre>
        <p>
            With this code, a normal result from<code>getJSON()</code> is still passed to <code>displayUserProfile()</code>, but any error in
            <code>getJSON()</code> or in <code>displayUserProfile()</code> (including any exceptions thrown by <code>displayUserProfile</code>) get passed to
            <code>handleProfileError()</code>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="chaining-promises">Chaining Promises</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most important benefits of Promises is that they provide a natural way to express a sequence of asynchronous operations as a linear chain
            of <code>then()</code> method invocations, without having to nest each operation within the callback of the previous one.
        </p>
        <pre><code>fetch(documentURL)

.then(response =&gt; response.json())

.then(document =&gt; {return render(document); })

.then(rendered =&gt; {cacheInDatabase(rendered); })

.catch(error =&gt; handle(error));</code></pre>
        <p>
            has largely been replaced by the newer, Promise-based Fetch API. In its simplest form, this new HTTP API is just the function fetch(). That promise
            is fulfilled when the HTTP response begins to arrive and the HTTP status and headers are available.
        </p>
        <pre><code>fetch(&quot;/api/user/profile&quot;)

.then(response =&gt; {

if (response.ok &amp;&amp;  response.headers.get(&quot;Content-Type&quot;) === &quot;application/json&quot;) {

// What can we do here? We don&#39;t actually have the response body yet.

}

});</code></pre>
        <p>
            But although the initial Promise is fulfilled, the body of the response may not yet have arrived. So these <code>text()</code> and<code
                >json()</code
            >
            methods for accessing the body of the response themselves return Promises.
        </p>
        <pre><code>fetch(&quot;/api/user/profile&quot;)

.then(response =&gt; {

return response.json();

})

.then(profile =&gt; {

displayUserProfile(profile);

});</code></pre>
        <p>
            There is a second <code>then()</code> in the chain, which means that the first invocation of the <code>then()</code> method must itself return a
            Promise. That is not how Promises work, however.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we write a chain of <code>.then()</code> invocations, we are not registering multiple callbacks on a single Promise object. Instead, each
            invocation of the <code>then()</code> method returns a new Promise object. That new Promise object is not fulfilled until the function passed to
            <code>then()</code> is complete.
        </p>
        <pre><code>fetch(theURL)       // task 1; returns promise 1

.then(callback1)  // task 2; returns promise 2

.then(callback2); // task 3; returns promise 3</code></pre>
        <h3 id="resolving-promises">Resolving Promises</h3>
        <p>There is actually a fourth Promise object involved as which brings up the point of what it means for a Promise to be “resolved.”</p>
        <p>
            fetch() returns a Promise object which, when fulfilled, passes a Response object to the callback function we register. This Response object
            has <code>.text(), .json(),</code> and other methods to request the body of the HTTP response in various forms. But since the body may not yet have
            arrived, these methods must return Promise objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            “task 2” calls the <code>.json()</code> method and returns its value. This is the fourth Promise object, and it is the return value of the
            <code>callback1()</code> function.
        </p>
        <p>Let’s consider:</p>
        <pre><code>function c1(response) {

let p4 = response.json();

return p4;

}

// callback 1

// returns promise 4

function c2(profile) {

displayUserProfile(profile);

}

// callback 2

let p1 = fetch(&quot;/api/user/profile&quot;);

promise 1, task 1

let p2 = p1.then(c1);

promise 2, task 2

let p3 = p2.then(c2);

promise 3, task 3</code></pre>
        <p>
            In order for Promise chains to work usefully, the output of task 2 must become the input to task 3. The input to task 3 is the body of the URL that
            was fetched, parsed as a JSON object. But the return value of callback c1 is not a JSON object, but Promise p4 for that JSON object.
        </p>
        <p>When p1 is fulfilled, c1 is invoked, and task 2 begins. And when p2 is fulfilled, c2 is invoked, and task 3 begins.</p>
        <p>
            And when p2 is fulfilled, c2 is invoked, and task 3 begins. But just because task 2 begins when c1 is invoked,it does not mean that task 2 must end
            when c1 returns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Promises are about managing asynchronous tasks, and if task 2 is asynchronous, then that task will not be complete by the time the callback returns.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you pass a callback c to the <code>then()</code> method, <code>then()</code> returns a Promise p and arranges to asynchronously invoke c at
            some later time. The callback performs some computation and returns a value v. When the callback returns, p is resolved with the value v. When a
            Promise is resolved with a value that is not itself a Promise, it is immediately fulfilled with that value.
        </p>
        <p>
            So if c returns a non-Promise, that return value becomes the value of p, p is fulfilled and we are done. But if the return value v is itself a
            Promise, then p is resolved but not yet fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this stage, p cannot settle until the Promise v settles. If v is fulfilled, then p will be fulfilled to the same value. If v is rejected, then p
            will be rejected for the same reason. This is what the “resolved” state of a Promise means
        </p>
        <p>
            the Promise has become associated with, or “locked onto,” another Promise. We don’t know yet whether p will be fulfilled or rejected, but our
            callback c no longer has any control over that. p is “resolved” in the sense that its fate now depends entirely on what happens to Promise v.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s bring this back to our URL-fetching example. When c1 returns p4, p2 is resolved. But being resolved is not the same as being fulfilled, so
            task 3 does not begin yet. When the full body of the HTTP response becomes available, then the .<code>json()</code> method can parse it and use that
            parsed value to fulfill p4. When p4 is fulfilled, p2 is automatically fulfilled as well, with the same parsed JSON value. At this point, the parsed
            JSON object is passed to c2, and task 3 begins.
        </p>
        <h3 id="more-on-promises-and-errors">More on Promises and Errors</h3>
        <p>
            With synchronous code, if you leave out error-handling code, you’ll at least get an exception and a stack trace that you can use to figure out what
            is going wrong. With asynchronous code, unhandled exceptions will often go unreported, and errors can occur silently, making them much harder to
            debug. The good news is that the <code>.catch()</code> method makes it easy to handle errors when working with Promises.
        </p>
        <p>THE CATCH AND FINALLY METHODS</p>
        <p>
            The <code>.catch()</code> method of a Promise is simply a shorthand way to call <code>.then()</code> with null as the first argument and an
            error-handling callback as the second argument.
        </p>
        <p>
            Normal exceptions don’t work with asynchronous code. The <code>.catch()</code> method of Promises is an alternative that does work for asynchronous
            code.
        </p>
        <pre><code>fetch(&quot;/api/user/profile&quot;)

.then(response =&gt; {

if (!response.ok) {

return null;

}

let type = response.headers.get(&quot;content-type&quot;);

if (type !== &quot;application/json&quot;) {

throw new TypeError(`Expected JSON, got ${type}`);

}

return response.json();

})

.then(profile =&gt; {

if (profile) {

displayUserProfile(profile);

}

else {

displayLoggedOutProfilePage();

}

})

.catch(e =&gt; {

if (e instanceof NetworkError) {

displayErrorMessage(&quot;Check your internet connection.&quot;);

}

else if (e instanceof TypeError) {

displayErrorMessage(&quot;Something is wrong with our server!&quot;);

}

else {

console.error(e);

}

});</code></pre>
        <p>p1 is the Promise returned by the <code>fetch()</code> call</p>
        <p>p2 is the Promise returned by the first <code>.then()</code> call</p>
        <p>c1 is the callback that we pass to that .<code>then()</code> call</p>
        <p>p3 is the Promise returned by the second <code>.then()</code> call</p>
        <p>c2 is the callback we pass to that call</p>
        <p>c3 is the callback that we pass to the <code>.catch()</code> call</p>
        <p>The first thing that could fail is the fetch() request itself. Let’s say p1 was rejected with a NetworkError object.</p>
        <p>
            We didn’t pass an error-handling callback function as the second argument to the <code>.then()</code> call, so p2 rejects as well with the same
            NetworkError object.
        </p>
        <p>Without a handler, though, p2 is rejected, and then p3 is rejected for the same reason.</p>
        <p>At this point, the c3 error-handling callback is called, and the NetworkError-specific code within it runs.</p>
        <p>
            There are a couple of things worth noting about this code. First, notice that the error object thrown with a regular, synchronous throw statement
            ends up being handled asynchronously with a <code>.catch()</code> method invocation in a Promise chain. This should make it clear why this shorthand
            method is preferred over passing a second argument to .<code>then()</code>, and also why it is so idiomatic to end Promise chains with a <code
                >.catch()</code
            >
            call.
        </p>
        <p>
            it is also perfectly valid to use <code>.catch()</code> elsewhere in a Promise chain. If one of the stages in your Promise chain can fail with an
            error, and if the error is some kind of recoverable error that should not stop the rest of the chain from running, then you can insert a <code
                >.catch()</code
            >
            call in the chain, resulting in code that might look like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>startAsyncOperation()

.then(doStageTwo)

.catch(recoverFromStageTwoError)

.then(doStageThree)

.then(doStageFour)

.catch(logStageThreeAndFourErrors);</code></pre>
        <p>
            If the callback returns normally, then the <code>.catch()</code> callback will be skipped, and the return value of the previous callback will become
            the input to the next .<code>then()</code> callback.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once an error has been passed to a <code>.catch()</code> callback, it stops propagating down the Promise chain. A <code>.catch()</code> callback can
            throw a new error, but if it returns normally, than that return value is used to resolve and/or fulfill the associated Promise, and<br />
             the error stops propagating.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, in complex network environments, errors can occur more or less at random, and it can be appropriate to handle those errors by simply
            retrying the asynchronous request.
        </p>

        <h3 id="promises-in-parallel">Promises in Parallel</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes,we want to execute a number of asynchronous operations in parallel. The function <code>Promise.all()</code> can do this.
            <code>Promise.all()</code> takes an array of Promise objects as its input and returns a Promise.
        </p>
        <p>
            The returned Promise will be rejected if any of the input Promises are rejected. Otherwise, it will be fulfilled with an array of the fulfillment
            values of each of the input Promises.
        </p>
        <pre><code>const urls = [ /* zero or more URLs here */ ];

promises = urls.map(url =&gt; fetch(url).then(r =&gt; r.text()));

Promise.all(promises)

.then(bodies =&gt; { /* do something with the array of strings */ })

.catch(e =&gt; console.error(e));</code></pre>
        <p>
            The Promise returned by <code>Promise.all()</code> rejects when any of the input Promises is rejected. This happens immediately upon the first
            rejection and can happen while other input Promises are still pending. In ES2020, <code>Promise.allSettled()</code> takes an array of input<br />
             Promises and returns a Promise, just like Promise.all() does. But <code>Promise.allSettled()</code> never rejects the returned Promise, and it does
            not fulfill that Promise until all of the input Promises have settled. The Promise resolves to an array of objects, with one object for each input
            Promise. Each of these returned objects has a status property set to “fulfilled” or “rejected.” If the status is “fulfilled”, then the object will
            also have a value property that gives the fulfillment value. And if the status is “rejected”, then the object will also have a reason property that
            gives the error or rejection value of the corresponding Promise.
        </p>
        <pre><code>Promise.allSettled([Promise.resolve(1), Promise.reject(2),3]).then(results =&gt; {

results[0] // =&gt; { status: &quot;fulfilled&quot;, value: 1 }

results[1] // =&gt; { status: &quot;rejected&quot;, reason: 2 }

results[2] // =&gt; { status: &quot;fulfilled&quot;, value: 3 }

});</code></pre>
        <p>
            Occasionally, you may want to run a number of Promises at once but may only care about the value of the first one to fulfill. In that case, you can
            use <code>Promise.race()</code> instead of <code>Promise.all()</code>. It returns a Promise that is fulfilled or rejected when the first of the
            Promises in the input array is fulfilled or rejected.

        <h3 id="async-and-await">async and await</h3>
        <p>
            These new keywords dramatically simplify the use of Promises and allow us to write Promise-based, asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code
            that blocks while waiting for network responses or other asynchronous events.
        </p>
        <p>
            Asynchronous code can’t return a value or throw an exception the way that regular synchronous code can. And this is why Promises are designed the
            way the are. The value of a fulfilled Promise is like the return value of a synchronous function. And the value of a rejected Promise is like a
            value thrown by a synchronous function.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> take efficient, Promise-based code and hide the Promises so that your asynchronous code can be as easy to
            read and as easy to reason about as inefficient, blocking, synchronous code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given a Promise object p, the expression await p waits until p settles. If p fulfills, then the value of await p is the fulfillment value of p. On
            the other hand, if p is rejected, then the await p expression throws the rejection value of p.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let response = await fetch(&quot;/api/user/profile&quot;);

let profile = await response.json();</code></pre>
        <p>
            It is critical to understand right away that the <code>await</code> keyword does not cause your program to block and literally do nothing until the
            specified Promise settles. The code remains asynchronous, and the <code>await</code> simply disguises this fact. This means that any code that uses
            await is itself asynchronous.
        </p>
        <h3 id="async-functions">async Functions</h3>
        <p>
            Because any code that uses await is asynchronous, there is one critical rule: you can only use the await keyword within functions that have been
            declared with the <code>async</code> keyword.
        </p>
        <pre><code>async function getHighScore() {

let response = await fetch(&quot;/api/user/profile&quot;);

let profile = await response.json();

return profile.highScore;

}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Declaring a function <code>async</code> means that the return value of the function will be a Promise even if no Promise-related code appears in the
            body of the function.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>getHighScore()</code> function is declared <code>async</code>, so it returns a Promise. And because it returns a Promise, we can use the
            <code>await</code> keyword with it:
        </p>
        <pre><code>displayHighScore(await getHighScore());</code></pre>
        <h3 id="awaiting-multiple-promises">Awaiting Multiple Promises</h3>
        <p>Suppose that we’ve written our <code>getJSON()</code> function using async:</p>
        <pre><code>async function getJSON(url) {

let response = await fetch(url);

let body = await response.json();

return body;

}</code></pre>
        <p>And now suppose that we want to fetch two JSON values with this function</p>
        <pre><code>let value1 = await getJSON(url1);

let value2 = await getJSON(url2);</code></pre>
        <p>
            The problem with this code is that it is unnecessarily sequential: the fetch of the second URL will not begin until the first fetch is complete. If
            the second URL does not depend on the value obtained from the firstURL, then we should probably try to fetch the two values at the same time.
        </p>
        <pre><code>let [value1, value2] = await Promise.all([getJSON(url1), getJSON(url2)]);</code></pre>

        <pre><code>const promises = urls.map(url =&gt; fetch(url));</code></pre>
        <p>
            We could now use<code>Promise.all()</code> to wait for all the Promises in the array to be fulfilled. But suppose we want the results of the first
            fetch as soon as they become available and don’t want to wait for all the URLs to be fetched.
