        <p>
            Nailing an interview takes more than just knowing how to answer common interview questions. You’ll also need to prepare questions of your own, think
            about salary, and get your communications right. Here’s how.
        </p>
        <h4 id="questions-to-ask-in-an-interview">Questions to ask in an interview</h4>
        <p>
            ⮕As the job seeker, it’s normal to feel like you’re being interrogated during interviews. However, at its core, an interview is a conversation, and
            should be a two-way interaction. As the interviewee, you need to stay engaged and ask thoughtful questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            ⮕By asking questions, you’re expressing your genuine curiosity towards the company. This helps companies know that you’re serious about them.
            Additionally, it also helps you evaluate whether the job and/or the company is really what you’re looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
            ⮕There are fantastic resources out there with more than a dozen questions you can ask interviewers. Here, we’ll provide a few that we think are
            essential to help you gain deeper understandings about the role, company, and your future within the company:
        </p>
        <p>⮕The job and cross-team communication</p>
        <p>⮕The company’s values and working culture</p>
        <p>⮕What are some shared qualities and characteristics among your employees?</p>
        <p>⮕What’s your favorite part about working at the company?</p>
        <p>⮕What’s your least favorite part about working at the company?</p>
        <p>Professional growth opportunities</p>
        <p>⮕Are there multiple product/service teams in the company? Can engineers apply to join a different team? What does the process look like?</p>
        <p>⮕Are there professional development courses and training available?</p>
        <p>⮕Do senior engineers and engineering leads usually get promoted from within the company?</p>

                may be eager to follow up with the hiring manager regarding your interview results. With that said, there’s a fine line between showing your
