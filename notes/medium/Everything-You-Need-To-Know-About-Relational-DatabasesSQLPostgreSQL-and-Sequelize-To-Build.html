        <h3 id="accessing-the-data">Accessing the Data</h3>
        <p>
            You can access and query the data using the <code>findByPk</code> , <code>findOne</code> , and <code>findAll</code> methods. First, make sure you
            import the models in your JavaScript file. In this case, we are assuming your JavaScript file is in the root of your project and so is the models
            folder.
        </p>
        <pre><code>const { Recipe, Ingredient, Instruction, MeasurementUnit } = require(&#39;./models&#39;);</code></pre>
        <p>
            The models folder exports each of the models that you have created. We have these four in our data model, so we will destructure the models to
            access each table individually. The associations that you have defined in each of your models will allow you to access data of related tables when
            you query your database using the <code>include</code> option.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to find all recipes, for the recipe list, you would use the <code>findAll</code> method. You need to await this, so make sure your
            function is async.
        </p>
        <pre><code>async function findAllRecipes() {

return await Recipe.findAll();

}</code></pre>
        <p>
            If you would like to include all the ingredients so you can create a shopping list for all the recipes, you would use <code>include</code> . This is
            possible because of the association you have defined in your Recipe and Ingredient models.
        </p>
        <pre><code>async function getShoppingList() {

return await Recipe.findAll({ include: [ Ingredient ] });

}</code></pre>
        <p>If you only want to find one where there is chicken in the ingredients list, you would use <code>findOne</code> and <code>findByPk</code> .</p>
        <pre><code>async function findAChickenRecipe() {

const chickenRecipe = await Ingredient.findOne({

where: {

foodStuff: &#39;chicken&#39;

}

});

return await Recipe.findByPk(chickenRecipe.recipeId);

}</code></pre>
        <h3 id="data-access-to-createupdatedelete-rows">Data Access to Create/Update/Delete Rows</h3>
        <p>
            You have two options when you want to create a row in a table (where you are saving one record into the table). You can either 
            <code>.build</code> the row and then  <code>.save</code> it, or you can  <code>.create</code> it. Either way it does the same thing. Here are some
            examples:
        </p>
        <p>Let’s say we have a form that accepts the name of the recipe (for simplicity). When we get the results of the form, we can:</p>
        <pre><code>const newRecipe = await Recipe.build({ title: &#39;Chicken Noodle Soup&#39; });

await newRecipe.save();</code></pre>
        <p>This just created our new recipe and added it to our Recipes table. You can do the same thing like this:</p>
        <pre><code>await Recipe.create({ title: &#39;Chicken Noodle Soup&#39; });</code></pre>
        <p>
            If you want to modify an item in your table, you can use <code>update</code> . Let’s say we want to change the chicken noodle soup to chicken noodle
            soup with extra veggies, first we need to get the recipe, then we can update it.
        </p>
        <pre><code>const modRecipe = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: &#39;Chicken Noodle Soup&#39; } });

await modRecipe.update({ title: &#39;Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies&#39; });</code></pre>
        <p>
            To delete an item from your table, you will do the same kind of process. Find the recipe you want to delete and <code>destroy</code> it, like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>const deleteThis = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: &#39;Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies&#39; } });

await deleteThis.destroy();</code></pre>
        <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you do not await these, you will receive a promise, so you will need to use  <code>.then</code> and 
            <code>.catch</code> to do more with the items you are accessing and modifying.
        </p>
        <h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
        <p>
            For the data types and validations in your models, here are the official docs. The sequelize docs are hard to look at, so these are the specific
            sections with just the lists:<br />
            <strong>Sequelize Data Types:</strong>
            <a href="https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
                ><em>https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html</em></a
            ><br />
            <strong>Validations:</strong>
            <a href="https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html#validations" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
                ><em>https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html#validations</em></a
            ><br />
            When you access the data in your queries, here are the operators available, again because the docs are hard to navigate, this is the specific
            section with the list of operators.<br />
            <strong>Operators:</strong>
            <a href="https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
                ><em>https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators</em></a
            ><br />
            The documentation for building, saving, creating, updating and destroying is linked here, it does a pretty good job of explaining in my opinion, it
            just has a title that we have not been using in this course. When they talk about an instance, they mean an item stored in your table.<br />
            <strong>Create/Update/Destroy:</strong>
            <a href="https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/instances.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
