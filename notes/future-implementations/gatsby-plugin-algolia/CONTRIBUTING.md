# Gatsby Plugin for Algolia

Hey there! Thanks for looking into how to contribute to our Algolia plugin ðŸ’Œ. This plugin works by hooking into the `onPostBuild` hook in Gatsby, so it will only run on production builds, not on development builds. 

The goals of this project are to create a nice plugin which will do _as little as operations as possible_ and be _as fast as possible_ to generate any Algolia index from arbitrary Gatsby graphQL queries.

Any contribution is of course welcome!

## Releasing
