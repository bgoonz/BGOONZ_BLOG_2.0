A plugin that simplifies adding [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)  

## Description  
The goal of this plugin is to allow users to bring their content to life and cultivate engaged communities by integrating Disqus comments into their blazing-fast Gatsby websites. After struggling to integrate different Disqus components into my Gatsby site, creating an easily-configured plugin for the Gatsby ecosystem felt like a no-brainer.  

## Install  
```sh
$ yarn add gatsby-plugin-disqus
```  
or  
```sh
$ npm install -S gatsby-plugin-disqus
```
