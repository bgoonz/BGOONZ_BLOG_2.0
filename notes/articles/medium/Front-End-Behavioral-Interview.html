                                1. DESCRIBE A WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT YOU WORKED ON FROM START TO FINISH. WHAT APPROACH DID YOU TAKE, WHAT CHALLENGES DID YOU
                                FACE, AND HOW WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?

                                Tip: Be transparent about what a real web development project looks like for you. Highlight your wins, of course, but don't shy
                                away from being real about the challenges. Interviewers aren't looking to hear that you never have setbacks (that's not
                                realistic). They want to hear how you get past setbacks and ultimately succeed.

                            <p name="173c" id="173c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                                Tip: Similar to the last question, interviewers are looking for honesty here. Sometimes projects go badly, and that's OK. What's
                                important is how you respond to failures and learn from them so they don't happen next time.
                            </p>

                                3. WHICH PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES ARE YOU PROFICIENT IN? ARE THERE ANY LANGUAGES YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
                                NEED TO LEARN?
                            </h3>
                            <p name="e567" id="e567" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                                Tip: This question is pretty straightforward — -let the interviewer know which languages you're familiar with and how you use
                                them. Ideally, you've scoped out the job beforehand and know that your experience syncs with what the employer needs. At the
                                same time, have some new languages in mind that you'd like to learn. This highlights your willingness to keep growing
                                professionally.
                            </p>

                            <p name="6693" id="6693" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                                Tip: It's a common pitfall to interview for a job and never explicitly say WHY you want to work in this specific field or for
                                this particular employer/company. Even if the question doesn't get asked, find a way to touch on it during the interview.

                            <p name="9ddc" id="9ddc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                                Tip: You may be tempted to say whatever you think the interviewer is looking for, but it's way better to be honest. If the team
                                you'll be working with has a work style that's completely outside of your comfort zone, then this particular job might not be a
                                good fit for you. That being said, most development teams are dynamic and flexible, and if your employer knows what kind of
                                environment suits you best, they can help find a spot on the team that WILL work for you.
                            </p>

                                6. HOW DO YOU KEEP ON TOP OF INDUSTRY NEWS AND TRENDS, AND HOW DO YOU APPLY THIS TO YOUR WORK?

                            <p name="ab22" id="ab22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                                Tip: You DO keep up with industry news, don't you? If so, simply rattle off your list of favorite news sources and why they're
                                effective for keeping you in the know. And if tech news is something you've overlooked while being in the weeds of learning tech
                                skills, take a few minutes to find a few suitable news blogs and tech Twitter accounts to put in your hip pocket (and be ready
                                to bust them out at your next interview).

                            <p name="d067" id="d067" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">
                                Tip: The gist here is to demonstrate that you understand the importance of keeping clients and stakeholders up to date, and that
                                you have ideas for establishing systems of communication (or that you're willing to work with systems like Agile or Scrum if
                                they're used by your employer).

                                Tip: Having an effective communication strategy with stakeholders doesn't mean you won't sometimes receive negative feedback. So
                                how do you respond? Do you get defensive? Shut down? Give up? Or do you find creative ways to accept that feedback and address
                                client or shareholder concerns? Interviewers are looking for candidates who can adapt to and recover from hard times, so either
                                think of a real example that you can share, or develop a client appeasement gameplan that you'll use when the time comes.

                                TO TECH.

                                Tip: As a web developer you'll find yourself in situations where you need to talk "tech” with non-techies. Making your work make
                                sense to people who have no idea what it is you actually do is a valuable skill. Take off your developer hat for a day and think
                                of some ways to describe web development to someone who doesn't know Java from JavaScript.

                                Tip: Interviewers may ask you to provide an example of a website you think is less than stellar, then ask you to describe what
                                you think is lacking and what you'd do to improve it. It's a good idea to have examples and explanations on hand (as well as
                                examples of sites you think are super effective) going into an interview. Answering this question comprehensively shows
                                interviewers that you aren't signing on to mindlessly write code — -you understand what makes good sites good and how to make
                                bad sites better.

                                Tip: This question is another one where you might be tempted to make the interviewer happy. But you know what's guaranteed to
                                make YOU unhappy? Working for a manager whose style you can't stand. Be as flexible and as open minded as you can when
                                describing your preferred management style, but if there's something that's a complete deal-breaker for you (or that you
                                particularly appreciate), don't be shy about making it known.

                                Tip: Soft skills can be a difference maker. If it's a choice between a skilled programmer and a skilled programmer who can write
                                well or who has experience with project management, most employers will pick the latter. So have a list of your own soft skills
                                ready, but also have examples of how they'll be relevant to a web developer job. It's not enough to say you're good at written
                                and verbal communication. You need to explain how your excellent written and verbal communication skills will help you relay
                                project details to team members and stakeholders.

                                Tip: Yes, you're interviewing for a web developer job, but remember to look to other experiences in your life for inspiration.
                                Examples like the time you helped improve the ordering system at the cafe you worked at or put together a volunteer fundraising
                                effort to save the music program at your kids' school all speak to the breadth of your problem solving abilities and
                                experiences.
