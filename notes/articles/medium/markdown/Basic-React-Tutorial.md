<em>You should probably skip this oneâ€¦ seriously it's just for internal use!</em>

#### Using `()` implicitly returns components.Role of `index.js` is to _render_ your application.The reference to `root` comes from a div in the body of your public html file.State of a component is simply a regular JS Object.Class Components require `render()` method to return JSX.Functional Components directly return JSX.`Class` is `className` in React.When parsing for an integer just chain `Number.parseInt("123")`

### React Concepts and Features

There are many benefits to using React over just Vanilla JS.

-   <span id="6bac">`Modularity`</span>
-   <span id="3fc9">To avoid the mess of many event listeners and template strings, React gives you the benefit of a lot of modularity.</span>
-   <span id="20d5">`Easy to start`</span>
-   <span id="8e3e">No specials tools are needed to use Basic React.</span>
-   <span id="f1a2">You can start working directly with `createElement` method in React.</span>
-   <span id="2a43">`Declarative Programming`</span>
-   <span id="c587">React is declarative in nature, utilizing either it's build in createElement method or the higher-level language known as JSX.</span>
-   <span id="866d">`Reusability`</span>
-   <span id="eff3">Create elements that can be re-used over and over.  
     **One-flow of data**</span>
-   <span id="5c6e">React apps are built as a combination of parent and child components.</span>
-   <span id="5a30">Parents can have one or more child components, all children have parents.</span>
-   <span id="d6c8">Data is never passed from child to the parent.</span>
-   <span id="dc54">`Virtual DOM` : React provides a Virtual DOM that acts as an agent between the real DOM and the developer to help debug, maintain, and provide general use.</span>
-   <span id="90bf">Due to this usage, React handles web pages much more intelligently; making it one of the speediest Front End Libraries available.</span>
