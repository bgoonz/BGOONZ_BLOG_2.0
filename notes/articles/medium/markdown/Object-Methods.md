### Iterating Through Objects

Objects store _unordered_  
`key`-`value` pairs. With Objects we can not rely on indices to access values.  
Meaning - we'll have to iterate through objects in new ways to access the keys  
and values within.

This article will cover:

1.  <span id="164e">Iterate through Object `keys` and `values` using a `for...in` loop</span>
2.  <span id="a166">Use the `Object.keys` and the `Object.values` methods to iterate through an Object.</span>

### For In Loop

We can use special syntax to iterate through each `key` of an object (in  
arbitrary order). This is super useful for looping through **both** the keys and  
values of an object.

The syntax looks like this:

    // The current key is assigned to *variable* on each iteration.
    for (let variable in object) {
      statement;
    }

### ex.)

    let obj = { name: "Rose", cats: 2 };
    // The key we are accessing is assigned to the `currentKey`
    // *variable* on each iteration.
    for (let currentKey in obj) {
      console.log(currentKey);
    }
    // prints out:
    // name
    // cats

The example above prints all the keys found in `obj` to the screen.

On each iteration of the loop, the `key` we are currently accessing is assigned to the`currentKey` variable.

To access values in an object, we would throw some bracket notation  
into the mix:

    let obj = { name: "Rose", cats: 2 };
    for (let key in obj) {
      let value = obj[key];
      console.log(value);
    }
    // prints out:
    // Rose
    // 2

#### You can only use variable keys when using bracket notation (`obj[key]`)!

> Like all variables, you can name the current key variable whatever you like -  
> just be descriptive! Here is an example of using a descriptive name for a key  
> variable:

    let employees = {
      manager: "Angela",
      sales: "Gracie",
      service: "Paul"
    };
    for (let title in employees) {
      let person = employees[title];
      console.log(person);
    }
    // prints out:
    // Angela
    // Gracie
    // Paul

### What's a method?

A **method** is essentially a function that _belongs to_ an object.

That means that every _method is a function_, but **not** every function  
is a method.

-   <span id="cb33">`myFunc` is a function</span>
-   <span id="2c47">`myObject.myFunc` is a _method_ of the object `myObject`</span>
-   <span id="14fe">`myObject["myFunc"]` is a _method_ of the object `myObject`  
    A method is just a key-value pair where the **key is the function name and the  
    value is the function definition**! Let's use what we learned earlier to teach  
    our dog some new tricks:</span>

<!-- -->

    let dog = {
      name: "Fido"
    };
    // defining a new key-value pair where the *function name* is the key
    // the function itself is the value!
    dog.bark = function() {
      console.log("bark bark!");
    };
    // this is the same thing as above just using Bracket Notation
    dog["speak"] = function(string) {
      console.log("WOOF " + string + " WOOF!!!");
    };
    dog.bark(); // prints `bark bark!`
    dog.speak("pizza"); // prints `WOOF pizza WOOF!!!`

Additionally, we can give objects methods when we initialize them:

    let dog2 = {
      name: "Rover",
      bark: function() {
        console.log("bork bork!");
      },
      speak: function(string) {
        console.log("BORK " + string + " BORK!!!");
      }
    };
    // Notice that in the object above, we still separate the key-value pairs with commas.
    // `bark` and `speak` are just keys with functions as values.
    dog2.bark(); // prints `bork bork!`
    dog2.speak("burrito"); // prints `BORK burrito BORK!!!`

To invoke, or call, a method we need to specify **which** object is calling that method. In the example above the `dog2` object had the `bark` method so to invoke `bark` we had to specify it was `dog2`'s method: `dog2.bark()`.

### Useful Object Methods

### Iterating through keys using `Object.keys`

The `Object.keys` method accepts an object as the argument and returns an array of the _keys_ within that Object.

    > let dog = {name: "Fido", age: "2"}
    undefined
    > Object.keys(dog)
    ['name', 'age']
    > let cup = {color: "Red", contents: "coffee", weight: 5}
    undefined
    > Object.keys(cup)
    ['color', 'contents', 'weight']

The return value of `Object.keys` method is an array of keys - which is useful  
for iterating!

### Iterating through keys using `Object.values`

The `Object.values` method accepts an object as the argument and returns an  
array of the _values_ within that Object.

    > let dog = {name: "Fido", age: "2"}
    undefined
    > Object.values(dog)
    ['Fido', '2']
    > let cup = {color: "Red", contents: "coffee", weight: 5}
    undefined
    > Object.keys(cup)
    ['Red', 'coffee', 5]

The return value of `Object.values` method is an array of values - which is  
useful for iterating!
