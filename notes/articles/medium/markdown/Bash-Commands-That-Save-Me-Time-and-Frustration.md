### Here's a Cheatsheet:

### Getting Started (Advanced Users Skip Section):

---

#### ✔ Check the Current Directory ➡ `pwd`:

On the command line, it's important to know the directory we are currently working on. For that, we can use `pwd` command.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*dimzLUrmDI4Ufev6.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>It shows that I'm working on my Desktop directory.

#### ✔ Display List of Files ➡ `ls`:

To see the list of files and directories in the current directory use `ls` command in your CLI.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HHzVrK2CtTPwTdYT.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Shows all of my files and directories of my Desktop directory.

-   <span id="20cb">To show the contents of a directory pass the directory name to the `ls` command i.e. `ls directory_name`.</span>
-   <span id="5cd8">Some useful `ls` command options:-</span>

OptionDescriptionls -alist all files including hidden file starting with '.'ls -llist with the long formatls -lalist long format including hidden files

#### ✔ Create a Directory ➡ `mkdir`:

We can create a new folder using the `mkdir` command. To use it type `mkdir folder_name`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*m3dDyC9vRJBUZSxR.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Use `ls` command to see the directory is created or not.

I created a cli-practice directory in my working directory i.e. Desktop directory.

#### ✔ Move Between Directories ➡ `cd`:

It's used to change directory or to move other directories. To use it type `cd directory_name`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*34KGxT2G8oNMDnIc.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Can use `pwd` command to confirm your directory name.

Changed my directory to the cli-practice directory. And the rest of the tutorial I'm gonna work within this directory.

#### ✔ Parent Directory ➡ `..`:

We have seen `cd` command to change directory but if we want to move back or want to move to the parent directory we can use a special symbol `..` after `cd` command, like `cd ..`

#### ✔ Create Files ➡ `touch`:

We can create an empty file by typing `touch file_name`. It's going to create a new file in the current directory (the directory you are currently in) with your provided name.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*xu1wtv7gJ2NMvP60.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>I created a hello.txt file in my current working directory. Again you can use `ls` command to see the file is created or not.

Now open your hello.txt file in your text editor and write _Hello Everyone!_ into your hello.txt file and save it.

#### ✔ Display the Content of a File ➡ `cat`:

We can display the content of a file using the `cat` command. To use it type `cat file_name`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*iKf5w9QFNCeLRv8a.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Shows the content of my hello.txt file.

#### ✔ Move Files & Directories ➡ `mv`:

To move a file and directory, we use `mv` command.

By typing `mv file_to_move destination_directory`, you can move a file to the specified directory.

By entering `mv directory_to_move destination_directory`, you can move all the files and directories under that directory.

Before using this command, we are going to create two more directories and another txt file in our cli-practice directory.

`mkdir html css touch bye.txt`

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*piaAQz_MQpzo7DPH.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Yes, we can use multiple directories & files names one after another to create multiple directories & files in one command.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5jmj_ZyNz46GuQKz.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Moved my bye.txt file into my css directory and then moved my css directory into my html directory.

#### ✔ Rename Files & Directories ➡ `mv`:

`mv` command can also be used to rename a file and a directory.

You can rename a file by typing `mv old_file_name new_file_name` & also rename a directory by typing `mv old_directory_name new_directory_name`.

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*WTVu1dd6gr-nmWhD.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Renamed my hello.txt file to the hi.txt file and html directory to the folder directory.

#### ✔ Copy Files & Directories ➡ `cp`:

To do this, we use the `cp` command.

-   <span id="62fa">You can copy a file by entering `cp file_to_copy new_file_name`.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*kCLVtKN9oKPbHfRF.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Copied my hi.txt file content into hello.txt file. For confirmation open your hello.txt file in your text editor.

-   <span id="9bfc">You can also copy a directory by adding the `-r` option, like `cp -r directory_to_copy new_directory_name`.</span>

_The_ `-r` _option for "recursive" means that it will copy all of the files including the files inside of subfolders._

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MnmzMiioIYCuK92B.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Here I copied all of the files from the folder to folder-copy.

#### ✔ Remove Files & Directories ➡ `rm`:

To do this, we use the `rm` command.

-   <span id="487a">To remove a file, you can use the command like `rm file_to_remove`.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ohCmdthd92_HA6Ze.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>Here I removed my hi.txt file.

-   <span id="0e9a">To remove a directory, use the command like `rm -r directory_to_remove`.</span>

<figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*voDbzwSpw24A2RjQ.gif" class="graf-image" /></figure>I removed my folder-copy directory from my cli-practice directory i.e. current working directory.

#### ✔ Clear Screen ➡ `clear`:

Clear command is used to clear the terminal screen.

#### ✔ Home Directory ➡ `~`:

The Home directory is represented by `~`. The Home directory refers to the base directory for the user. If we want to move to the Home directory we can use `cd ~` command. Or we can only use `cd` command.

### MY COMMANDS:

### 1.) Recursively unzip zip files and then delete the archives when finished:

**here is a** <a href="https://github.com/bgoonz/bash-commands-walkthrough/tree/master/steps/1-recursive-unzip" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"><strong>folde</strong></a>**r containing the before and after… I had to change folder names slightly due to a limit on the length of file-paths in a github repo.**

    find . -name "*.zip" | while read filename; do unzip -o -d "`dirname "$filename"`" "$filename"; done;

    find . -name "*.zip" -type f -print -delete

---

### 2.) Install node modules recursively:

    npm i -g recursive-install

    npm-recursive-install

---

### 3.) Clean up unnecessary files/folders in git repo:

    find . -empty -type f -print -delete #Remove empty files

    # -------------------------------------------------------
    find . -empty -type d -print -delete #Remove empty folders

    # -------------------------------------------------------

    # This will remove .git folders...    .gitmodule files as well as .gitattributes and .gitignore files.

    find . \( -name ".git" -o -name ".gitignore" -o -name ".gitmodules" -o -name ".gitattributes" \) -exec rm -rf -- {} +

    # -------------------------------------------------------

    # This will remove the filenames you see listed below that just take up space if a repo has been downloaded for use exclusively in your personal file system (in which case the following files just take up space)# Disclaimer... you should not use this command in a repo that you intend to use with your work as it removes files that attribute the work to their original creators!

    badFolder Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript

    When implementing a language feature for JavaScript, an implementer must make decisions about how the language in the specification maps to the implementation. Private fields is an example of where the specification language and implementation reality diverge, at least in SpiderMonkey- the JavaScript engine which powers Firefox. To understand more, I'll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.The post Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

    Looking fine with Firefox 89

    Firefox 89 has smartened up and brings with it a slimmed-down, slightly more minimalist interface.badFolder Along with this new look, we get some great styling features including a force-colours feature for media queries and better control over how fonts are displayed. The long-awaited top-level await keyword for JavaScript modules is now enabled, as well as the PerformanceEventTiming interface, which is another addition to the performance suite of APIs: 89 really has been working out!The post Looking fine with Firefox 89 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.

### 7.) Execute command recursively:

**Here I have modified the command I wish to run recursively to account for the fact that the 'find' command already works recursively, by appending the -maxdepth 1 flag…**

> **I am essentially removing the recursive action of the find command…**

**That way, if the command affects the more deeply nested folders we know the outer RecurseDirs function we are using to run the _find/pandoc_ line once in every subfolder of the working directory… is working properly!**

_If you want to run any bash script recursively all you have to do is substitue out line \#9 with the command you want to run once in every sub-folder._

    function RecurseDirs ()
    {
        oldIFS=$IFS
        IFS=$'\n'
        for f in "$@"
        do

    #Replace the line below with your own command!

    #find ./ -iname "*.md" -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec sh -c 'pandoc --standalone "${0}" -o "${0%.md}.html"' {} \;

    if [[ -d "${f}" ]]; then
                cd "${f}"
                RecurseDirs $(ls -1 ".")
                cd ..
            fi
