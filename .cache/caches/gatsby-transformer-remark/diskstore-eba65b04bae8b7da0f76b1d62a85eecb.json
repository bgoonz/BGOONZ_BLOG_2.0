With React, users can create reusable components, and these components display data as it changes over time. React Native also exists to help you create native mobile apps using React (the more common approach for users). In other words, React is a JavaScript tool that makes it easy to reason about, construct, and maintain stateless and stateful user interfaces. It provides the means to declaratively define and divide a UI into UI components (a.k.a., React components) using HTML-like nodes called React nodes. React nodes eventually get transformed into a format for UI rendering (e.g., HTML/DOM, canvas, svg, etc.).</p>\n<p>I could ramble on trying to express in words what React is, but I think it best to just show you. What follows is a whirlwind tour of React and React components from thirty thousand feet. Don't try and figure out all the details yet as I describe React in this section. The entire book is meant to unwrap the details showcased in the following overview. Still asking, <a href=\"https://www.reactenlightenment.com/what-is-react.html\">what is react?</a> Just follow along grabbing a hold of the big concepts for now.</p>\n<h2>Using React to create UI components similar to a <code>&#x3C;select></code></h2>\n<p>Below is an HTML <code>&#x3C;select></code> element that encapsulates child HTML <code>&#x3C;option></code> elements. Hopefully the creation and functionality of an HTML <code>&#x3C;select></code> is already familiar.</p>\n<p>When a browser parses the above tree of elements it will produce a UI containing a textual list of items that can be selected. Click on the \"Result\" tab in the above JSFiddle, to see what the browser produces.</p>\n<p>The browser, <a href=\"http://domenlightenment.com/\">the DOM</a>, and the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Shadow_DOM\">shadow DOM</a> are working together behind the scenes to turn the <code>&#x3C;select></code> HTML into a UI component. Note that the <code>&#x3C;select></code> component allows the user to make a selection thus storing the state of that selection (i.e., click on \"Volvo\", and you have selected it instead of \"Mercedes\").</p>\n<p>Using React you can create a custom <code>&#x3C;select></code> by using React nodes to make a React component that eventually will result in HTML elements in an HTML DOM.</p>\n<p>Let's create our own <code>&#x3C;select></code>-like UI component using React.</p>\n<h2>Defining a React component</h2>\n<p>Below I am creating a React component by invoking the <code>React.createClass</code> function in order to create a <code>MySelect</code> React component.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the <code>MySelect</code> component is made up of some styles and an empty React <code>&#x3C;div></code> node element.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const MySelect = React.createClass({ //define MySelect component\n    render: function(){\n        const mySelectStyle = {\n            border: '1px solid #999',\n            display: 'inline-block',\n            padding: '5px'\n        };\n        // using {} to reference a JS variable inside of JSX\n        return &#x3C;div style={mySelectStyle}>\n&#x3C;/div>; //react div element, via JSX\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>That <code>&#x3C;div></code> is an HTML-like tag, yes in JavaScript, called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/jsx/\">JSX</a>. JSX is an optional custom JavaScript syntax used by React to express React nodes that can map to real HTML elements, custom elements, and text nodes. React nodes, defined using JSX should not be considered a one to one match to HTML elements. There are <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/dom-differences.html\">differences</a> and some <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-gotchas.html\">gotchas</a>.</p>\n<p>JSX syntax must be transformed from JSX to real JavaScript in order to be parsed by ES5 JS engines. The above code, if not transformed would of course cause a JavaScript error.</p>\n<p>The official tool used to transform JSX to actual JavaScript code is called <a href=\"http://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>.</p>\n<p>After Babel (or something similar) transforms the JSX <code>&#x3C;div></code> in the above code into real JavaScript, it will look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>return React.createElement('div', { style: mySelectStyle });\n</code></pre>\n<p>instead of this:</p>\n<pre><code>return &#x3C;div style={mySelectStyle}>\n&#x3C;/div>;\n</code></pre>\n<p>For now, just keep in mind that when you write HTML-like tags in React code, eventually it must be transformed into real JavaScript, along with any ES6 syntax.</p>\n<p>The <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> component at this point consist of an empty React <code>&#x3C;div></code> node element. That's a rather trivial component, so let's change it.</p>\n<p>I'm going to define another component called <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> and then use the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component within the <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> component (a.k.a., composition).</p>\n<p>Examine the updated JavaScript code below which defines both the <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> and <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> React components.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const MySelect = React.createClass({\n    render: function(){\n        const mySelectStyle = {\n            border: '1px solid #999',\n            display: 'inline-block',\n            padding: '5px'\n        };\n        return ( //react div element, via JSX, containing &#x3C;MyOption> component\n            &#x3C;div style={mySelectStyle}>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Volvo\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Saab\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Mercedes\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Audi\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n            &#x3C;/div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nconst MyOption = React.createClass({  //define MyOption component\n    render: function(){\n        return &#x3C;div>{this.props.value}&#x3C;/div>; //react div element, via JSX\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should note how the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component is used inside of the <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> component and that both are created using JSX.</p>\n<h2>Passing Component Options Using React attributes/props</h2>\n<p>Notice that the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component is made up of one <code>&#x3C;div></code> containing the expression <code>{this.props.value}</code>. The <code>{}</code> brackets indicate to JSX that a JavaScript expression is being used. In other words, inside of <code>{}</code> you can write JavaScript.</p>\n<p>The <code>{}</code> brackets are used to gain access (i.e., <code>this.props.value</code>) to the properties or attributes passed by the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component. In other words, when the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component is rendered the <code>value</code> option, passed using an HTML-like attribute (i.e., <code>value=\"Volvo\"</code>), will be placed into the <code>&#x3C;div></code>. These HTML looking attributes are considered React attributes/<a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props.html\">props</a>. React uses them to pass stateless/immutable options into components. In this case we are simply passing the <code>value</code> prop to the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component. Not unlike how an argument is passed to a JavaScript function. And in fact that is exactly what is going on behind the JSX.</p>\n<h2>Rendering a component to the Virtual DOM, then HTML DOM</h2>\n<p>At this point our JavaScript only defines two React Components. We have yet to actually render these components to the Virtual DOM and thus to the HTML DOM.</p>\n<p>Before we do that I'd like to mention that up to this point all we have done is define two React components using JavaScript. In theory, the JavaScript we have so far is just the definition of a UI component. It doesn't strictly have to go into a DOM, or even a Virtual DOM. This same definition, in theory, could also be used to render this component to a <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native\">native mobile platform</a> or an <a href=\"https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas\">HTML canvas</a>. But we're not going to do that, even though we could. Just be aware that React is a pattern for organizing a UI that can transcend the DOM, front-end applications, and <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdomserver\">even the web platform</a>.</p>\n<p>Let's now render the <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> component to the virtual DOM which in turn will render it to the actual DOM inside of an HTML page.</p>\n<p>In the JavaScript below notice I added a call to the <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> function on the last line. Here I am passing the <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> function the component we want to render (i.e., <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code>) and a reference to the HTML element already in the HTML DOM (i.e., `<div id=\"app\"></p>\n</div>`) where I want to render my React `<MySelect>` component.\n<p>Click on the \"Result\" tab and you will see our custom React <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> component rendered to the HTML DOM.</p>\n<p>Note that all I did was tell React where to start rendering components and which component to start with. React will then render any children components (i.e., <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code>) contained within the starting component (i.e., <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code>).</p>\n<p>Hold up, you might be thinking. We haven't actually created a <code>&#x3C;select></code> at all. All we have done is create a static/stateless list of text strings. We'll fix that next.</p>\n<p>Before I move on I want to point out that no implicit DOM interactions were written to get the <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> component into the real DOM. In other words, no jQuery code was invoked during the creation of this component. The dealings with the actual DOM have all been abstracted by the React virtual DOM. In fact, when using React what you are doing is describing a virtual DOM that React takes and uses to create a real DOM for you.</p>\n<h2>Using React state</h2>\n<p>In order for our <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> component to mimic a native <code>&#x3C;select></code> element we are going to have to add state. After all what good is a custom <code>&#x3C;select></code> element if it can't keep the state of the selection.</p>\n<p>State typically gets involved when a component contains snapshots of information. In regards to our custom <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component, its state is the currently selected text or the fact that no text is selected at all. Note that state will typically involve user events (i.e., mouse, keyboard, clipboard, etc.) or network events (i.e., AJAX) and its value is used to determine when the UI needs to be re-rendered (i.e., when value changes re-render).</p>\n<p>State is typically found on the top most component which makes up a UI component. Using the React <code>getInitialState()</code> function we can set the default state of our component to <code>false</code> (i.e., nothing selected) by returning a state object when <code>getInitialState</code> is invoked (i.e., <code>return {selected: false};</code>). The <code>getInitialState</code> <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle\">lifecycle method</a> gets invoked once before the component is mounted. The return value will be used as the initial value of <code>this.state</code>.</p>\n<p>I've updated the code below accordingly to add state to the component. As I am making updates to the code, make sure you read the JavaScript comments which call attention to the changes in the code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const MySelect = React.createClass({\n    getInitialState: function(){ //add selected, default state\n        return {selected: false}; //this.state.selected = false;\n    },\n    render: function(){\n        const mySelectStyle = {\n            border: '1px solid #999',\n            display: 'inline-block',\n            padding: '5px'\n        };\n        return (\n            &#x3C;div style={mySelectStyle}>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Volvo\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Saab\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Mercedes\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Audi\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n            &#x3C;/div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nconst MyOption = React.createClass({\n    render: function(){\n        return &#x3C;div>{this.props.value}&#x3C;/div>;\n    }\n});\n\nReactDOM.render(&#x3C;MySelect />, document.getElementById('app'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the default state set, next we'll add a callback function called <code>select</code> that gets called when a user clicks on an option. Inside of this function we get the text of the option that was selected (via the <code>event</code> parameter) and use that to determine how to <code>setState</code> on the current component. Notice that I am using <code>event</code> details passed to the <code>select</code> callback. This pattern should look familiar if you've had any experience with jQuery.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const MySelect = React.createClass({\n    getInitialState: function(){\n        return {selected: false};\n    },\n    select:function(event){// added select function\n        if(event.target.textContent === this.state.selected){//remove selection\n            this.setState({selected: false}); //update state\n        }else{//add selection\n            this.setState({selected: event.target.textContent}); //update state\n        }   \n    },\n    render: function(){\n        const mySelectStyle = {\n            border: '1px solid #999',\n            display: 'inline-block',\n            padding: '5px'\n        };\n        return (\n            &#x3C;div style={mySelectStyle}>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Volvo\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Saab\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Mercedes\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption value=\"Audi\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n            &#x3C;/div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nconst MyOption = React.createClass({\n    render: function(){\n        return &#x3C;div>{this.props.value}&#x3C;/div>;\n    }\n});\n\nReactDOM.render(&#x3C;MySelect />, document.getElementById('app'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order for our <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> components to gain access to the <code>select</code> function we'll have to pass a reference to it, via props, from the <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> component to the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component. To do this we add <code>select={this.select}</code> to the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> components.</p>\n<p>With that in place we can add <code>onClick={this.props.select}</code> to the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> components. Hopefully it's obvious that all we have done is wired up a <code>click</code> event that will call the <code>select</code> function. React takes care of wiring up the real click handler in the real DOM for you.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const MySelect = React.createClass({\n    getInitialState: function(){\n        return {selected: false};\n    },\n    select:function(event){\n        if(event.target.textContent === this.state.selected){\n            this.setState({selected: false});\n        }else{\n            this.setState({selected: event.target.textContent});\n        }   \n    },\n    render: function(){\n        const mySelectStyle = {\n            border: '1px solid #999',\n            display: 'inline-block',\n            padding: '5px'\n        };\n        return (//pass reference, using props, to select callback to &#x3C;MyOption>\n            &#x3C;div style={mySelectStyle}>\n                &#x3C;MyOption select={this.select} value=\"Volvo\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption select={this.select} value=\"Saab\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption select={this.select} value=\"Mercedes\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n                &#x3C;MyOption select={this.select} value=\"Audi\">\n&#x3C;/MyOption>\n            &#x3C;/div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nconst MyOption = React.createClass({\n    render: function(){//add event handler that will invoke select callback\n        return &#x3C;div onClick={this.props.select}>{this.props.value}&#x3C;/div>;\n    }\n});\n\nReactDOM.render(&#x3C;MySelect />, document.getElementById('app'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>By doing all this we can now set the state by clicking on one of the options. In other words, when you click on an option the <code>select</code> function will now run and set the state of the <code>MySelect</code> component. However, the user of the component has no idea this is being done because all we have done is update our code so that state is managed by the component. At this point we have no feedback visually that anything is selected. Let's fix that.</p>\n<p>The next thing we will need to do is pass the current state down to the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component so that it can respond visually to the state of the component.</p>\n<p>Using props, again, we will pass the <code>selected</code> state from the <code>&#x3C;MySelect></code> component down to the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component by placing the property <code>state={this.state.selected}</code> on all of the <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> components. Now that we know the state (i.e., <code>this.props.state</code>) and the current value (i.e., <code>this.props.value</code>) of the option we can verify if the state matches the value in a given <code>&#x3C;MyOption></code> component . If it does, we then know that this option should be selected. We do this by writing a simple <code>if</code> statement which adds a styled selected state (i.e., <code>selectedStyle</code>) to the JSX <code>&#x3C;div></code> if the state matches the value of the current option. Otherwise, we return a React element with <code>unSelectedStyle</code> styles.</p>\n<p>Make sure you click on the \"Result\" tab above and use the custom React select component to verify the new functioning.</p>\n<p>While our React UI select component is not as pretty or feature complete as you might hope, I think you can see still where all this is going. React is a tool that can help you reason about, construct, and maintain stateless and stateful UI components, in a structure tree (i.e., a tree of components).</p>\n<p>Before moving on to the role of the virtual DOM I do want to stress that you don't have to use JSX and Babel. You can always bypass these tools and just write straight JavaScript. Below, I'm showing the final state of the code after the JSX has been transformed by Babel. If you choose not to use JSX, then you'll have to write the following code yourself instead of the code I've written throughout this section.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const MySelect = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'MySelect',\n\n  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n    return { selected: false };\n  },\n  select: function select(event) {\n    if (event.target.textContent === this.state.selected) {\n      this.setState({ selected: false });\n    } else {\n      this.setState({ selected: event.target.textContent });\n    }\n  },\n  render: function render() {\n    const mySelectStyle = {\n      border: '1px solid #999',\n      display: 'inline-block',\n      padding: '5px'\n    };\n    return React.createElement(\n      'div',\n      { style: mySelectStyle },\n      React.createElement(MyOption, { state: this.state.selected, select: this.select, value: 'Volvo' }),\n      React.createElement(MyOption, { state: this.state.selected, select: this.select, value: 'Saab' }),\n      React.createElement(MyOption, { state: this.state.selected, select: this.select, value: 'Mercedes' }),\n      React.createElement(MyOption, { state: this.state.selected, select: this.select, value: 'Audi' })\n    );\n  }\n});\n\nconst MyOption = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'MyOption',\n\n  render: function render() {\n    const selectedStyle = { backgroundColor: 'red', color: '#fff', cursor: 'pointer' };\n    const unSelectedStyle = { cursor: 'pointer' };\n    if (this.props.value === this.props.state) {\n      return React.createElement(\n        'div',\n        { style: selectedStyle, onClick: this.props.select },\n        this.props.value\n      );\n    } else {\n      return React.createElement(\n        'div',\n        { style: unSelectedStyle, onClick: this.props.select },\n        this.props.value\n      );\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nReactDOM.render(React.createElement(MySelect, null), document.getElementById('app'));\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Understanding the role of the Virtual DOM</h2>\n<p>I'm going to end this whirlwind tour where most people typically start talking about React. I'll finish off this React overview by talking about the merits of the React virtual DOM.</p>\n<p>Hopefully you notice the only interaction with the real DOM we had during the creation of our custom select UI is when we told the <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> function where to render our UI component in the HTML page (i.e., render it to `<div id=\"app\"></p>\n</div>`). This might just be the only interaction you ever have with the real DOM when building out a React application from a tree of React components. And herein lies much of the value of React. By using React, you really don't ever have to think about the DOM like you once did when you were writing jQuery code. React replaces jQuery, as a complete DOM abstraction, by removing most, if not all, implicit DOM interactions from your code. Of course, that's not the only benefit, or even the best benefit.\n<p>Because the DOM has been completely abstracted by the Virtual DOM this allows for a heavy handed performance pattern of updating the real DOM when state is changed. The Virtual DOM keeps track of UI changes based on state and props. It then compares that to the real DOM, and then makes only the minimal changes required to update the UI. In other words, the real DOM is only ever patched with the minimal changes needed when state or props change.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seeing these performant updates in real time will often clarify any confusion about the performant DOM diffing. Look at the animated image below showcasing the usage (i.e., changing state) of the UI component we created in this chapter.</li>\n<li>Notice that as the UI component changes state only the minimally needed changes to the real DOM are occurring. We know that React is doing it's job because the only parts of the real DOM that are actually being updated are the parts with a green outline/background. The entire UI component is not being updated on each state change, only the parts that require a change.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let me be clear, this isn't a revolutionary concept. You could accomplish the same thing with some carefully crafted and performant minded jQuery code. However, by using React you'll rarely, if ever, have to think about it. The Virtual DOM is doing all the performance work for you. In a sense, this is the best type of jQuery/DOM abstraction possible. One where you don't even have to worry about, or code for, the DOM. It all just happens behinds the scene without you ever implicitly having to interact with the DOM itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, it might be tempting to leave this overview thinking the value of React is contained in the fact that it almost eliminates the need for something like jQuery. And while the Virtual DOM is certainly a relief when compared to implicit jQuery code, the value of React does not rest alone on the Virtual DOM. The Virtual DOM is just the icing on the cake. Simply stated, the value of React rests upon the fact it provides a simple and maintainable pattern for creating a tree of UI components. Imagine how simple programming a UI could be by defining the entire interface of your application using reusable React components alone.</p>\n</details>\n<p>We'll get to the funny XML-like tags soon. We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen. When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.</p>\n<p>Here, ShoppingList is a <strong>React component class</strong>, or <strong>React component type</strong>. A component takes in parameters, called <code>props</code> (short for \"properties\"), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the <code>render</code> method.</p>\n<p>The <code>render</code> method returns a <em>description</em> of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result. In particular, <code>render</code> returns a <strong>React element</strong>, which is a lightweight description of what to render. Most React developers use a special syntax called \"JSX\" which makes these structures easier to write. The <code>&#x3C;div /></code> syntax is transformed at build time to <code>React.createElement('div')</code>. The example above is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre><code>return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},\n  React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),\n  React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)\n);\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>---\n\n### Valid JSX:\n\n    &#x3C;div>\n      &#x3C;p>Paragraph One&#x3C;/p>\n      &#x3C;p>Paragraph Two&#x3C;/p>\n      &#x3C;p>Paragraph Three&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;/div>\n\n---\n\n### Invalid JSX:\n\n    &#x3C;p>Paragraph One&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;p>Paragraph Two&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;p>Paragraph Three&#x3C;/p>\n\n#### To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/\\* \\*/} to wrap around the comment text.\n\nTo put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/\\* \\*/} to wrap around the comment text.\n\nThe code editor has a JSX element similar to what you created in the last challenge. Add a comment somewhere within the provided div element, without modifying the existing h1 or p elements.\n\n\n```js\n\n    const JSX = (\n      &#x3C;div>\n      {/* This is a comment */}\n        &#x3C;h1>This is a block of JSX&#x3C;/h1>\n        &#x3C;p>Here's a subtitle&#x3C;/p>\n      &#x3C;/div>\n    );\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this:</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"f724\">the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render,</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"7093\">and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"aafc\">— -> This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript.

Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed.  \n> The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as_ `&#x3C;br />` _in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled.  \n> A_ `&#x3C;div>`_, on the other hand, can be written as_ `&#x3C;div />`_or_`&#x3C;div>\n&#x3C;/div>`_.  \n> The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the_ `&#x3C;div />`_._\n\n### Fix the errors in the code editor so that it is valid JSX and successfully transpiles. Make sure you don't change any of the content — you only need to close tags where they are needed.\n\n\n```js\n\n    const JSX = (\n      &#x3C;div>\n        &#x3C;h2>Welcome to React!&#x3C;/h2> &#x3C;br >\n        &#x3C;p>Be sure to close all tags!&#x3C;/p>\n        &#x3C;hr >\n      &#x3C;/div>\n    );\n\n### Ans:\n\n```js\n\n const JSX = (\n      &#x3C;div>\n        &#x3C;h2>Welcome to React!&#x3C;/h2> &#x3C;br />\n        &#x3C;p>Be sure to close all tags!&#x3C;/p>\n        &#x3C;hr />\n      &#x3C;/div>\n    );\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<h3>React: Create a Stateless Functional Component</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>There are two ways to create a React component.
