For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const btn = document.querySelector(\"button\");\n\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  alert(\"hi!\");\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>In React, we write event handlers directly on the elements in our JSX, like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">&#x3C;button type=\"button\" onClick={() => alert(\"hi!\")}>\n  Say hi!\n&#x3C;/button>\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This may seem counter-intuitive regarding best-practice advice that tends to advise against use of inline event handlers on HTML, but remember that JSX is actually part of your JavaScript.</p>\n<p>In the above example, we're adding an <code>onClick</code> attribute to the <code>&#x3C;button></code> element. The value of that attribute is a function that triggers a simple alert.</p>\n<p>The <code>onClick</code> attribute has special meaning here: it tells React to run a given function when the user clicks on the button. There are a couple of other things to note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The camel-cased nature of <code>onClick</code> is important — JSX will not recognize <code>onclick</code> (again, it is already used in JavaScript for a specific purpose, which is related but different — standard <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onclick\"><code>onclick</code></a> handler properties).</li>\n<li>All browser events follow this format in JSX – <code>on</code>, followed by the name of the event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's apply this to our app, starting in the <code>Form.js</code> component.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#handling_form_submission\" title=\"Permalink to Handling form submission\">Handling form submission</a></h3>\n<p>At the top of the <code>Form()</code> component function, create a function named <code>handleSubmit()</code>. This function should <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#preventing_default_behavior\">prevent the default behavior of the <code>submit</code> event</a>. After that, it should trigger an <code>alert()</code>, which can say whatever you'd like. It should end up looking something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">function handleSubmit(e) {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  alert(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To use this function, add an <code>onSubmit</code> attribute to the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form\"><code>&#x3C;form></code></a> element, and set its value to the <code>handleSubmit</code> function:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now if you head back to your browser and click on the \"Add\" button, your browser will show you an alert dialog with the words \"Hello, world!\" — or whatever you chose to write there.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#callback_props\" title=\"Permalink to Callback props\">Callback props</a></h2>\n<p>In React applications, interactivity is rarely confined to just one component: events that happen in one component will affect other parts of the app. When we start giving ourselves the power to make new tasks, things that happen in the <code>&#x3C;Form /></code> component will affect the list rendered in <code>&#x3C;App /></code>.</p>\n<p>We want our <code>handleSubmit()</code> function to ultimately help us create a new task, so we need a way to pass information from <code>&#x3C;Form /></code> to <code>&#x3C;App /></code>. We can't pass data from child to parent in the same way as we pass data from parent to child using standard props. Instead, we can write a function in <code>&#x3C;App /></code> that will expect some data from our form as an input, then pass that function to <code>&#x3C;Form /></code> as a prop. This function-as-a-prop is called a callback prop. Once we have our callback prop, we can call it inside <code>&#x3C;Form /></code> to send the right data to <code>&#x3C;App /></code>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#handling_form_submission_via_callbacks\" title=\"Permalink to Handling form submission via callbacks\">Handling form submission via callbacks</a></h3>\n<p>Inside the top of our <code>App()</code> component function, create a function named <code>addTask()</code> which has a single parameter of <code>name</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>function addTask(name) {\n  alert(name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we'll pass <code>addTask()</code> into <code>&#x3C;Form /></code> as a prop. The prop can have whatever name you want, but pick a name you'll understand later. Something like <code>addTask</code> works, because it matches the name of the function as well as what the function will do. Your <code>&#x3C;Form /></code> component call should be updated as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;Form addTask={addTask} />\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, you can use this prop inside the <code>handleSubmit()</code> function in your <code>&#x3C;Form /></code> component! Update it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>function handleSubmit(e) {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  props.addTask(\"Say hello!\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Clicking on the \"Add\" button in your browser will prove that the <code>addTask()</code> callback function works, but it'd be nice if we could get the alert to show us what we're typing in our input field! This is what we'll do next.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> We decided to name our callback prop <code>addTask</code> to make it easy to understand what the prop will do. Another common convention you may well come across in React code is to prefix callback prop names with the word <code>on</code>, followed by the name of the event that will cause them to be run. For instance, we could have given our form a prop of <code>onSubmit</code> with the value of <code>addTask</code>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#state_and_the_usestate_hook\" title=\"Permalink to State and the useState hook\">State and the <code>useState</code> hook</a></h2>\n<p>So far, we've used props to pass data through our components and this has served us just fine. Now that we're dealing with user input and data updates, however, we need something more.</p>\n<p>For one thing, props come from the parent of a component. Our <code>&#x3C;Form /></code> will not be inheriting a new name for our task; our <code>&#x3C;input /></code> element lives directly inside of <code>&#x3C;Form /></code>, so <code>&#x3C;Form/></code> will be directly responsible for creating that new name. We can't ask <code>&#x3C;Form /></code> to spontaneously create its own props, but we <em>can</em> ask it to track some of its own data for us. Data such as this, which a component itself owns, is called <strong>state</strong>. State is another powerful tool for React because components not only <em>own</em> state, but can <em>update</em> it later. It's not possible to update the props a component receives; only to read them.</p>\n<p>React provides a variety of special functions that allow us to provide new capabilities to components, like state. These functions are called <strong>hooks</strong>, and the <code>useState</code> hook, as its name implies, is precisely the one we need in order to give our component some state.</p>\n<p>To use a React hook, we need to import it from the React module. In <code>Form.js</code>, change your very first line so that it reads like this:</p>\n<pre><code>import React, { useState } from \"react\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>This allows us to import the <code>useState()</code> function by itself, and utilize it anywhere in this file.</p>\n<p><code>useState()</code> creates a piece of state for a component, and its only parameter determines the <em>initial value</em> of that state. It returns two things: the state, and a function that can be used to update the state later.</p>\n<p>This is a lot to take in at once, so let's try it out. We're going to make ourselves a <code>name</code> state, and a function for updating the <code>name</code> state.</p>\n<p>Write the following above your <code>handleSubmit()</code> function, inside <code>Form()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const [name, setName] = useState('Use hooks!');\n</code></pre>\n<p>What's going on in this line of code?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are setting the initial <code>name</code> value as \"Use hooks!\".</li>\n<li>We are defining a function whose job is to modify <code>name</code>, called <code>setName()</code>.</li>\n<li><code>useState()</code> returns these two things, so we are using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment\">array destructuring</a> to capture them both in separate variables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#reading_state\" title=\"Permalink to Reading state\">Reading state</a></h3>\n<p>You can see the <code>name</code> state in action right away. Add a <code>value</code> attribute to the form's input, and set its value to <code>name</code>. Your browser will render \"Use hooks!\" inside the input.</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;input\n  type=\"text\"\n  id=\"new-todo-input\"\n  className=\"input input__lg\"\n  name=\"text\"\n  autoComplete=\"off\"\n  value={name}\n/>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Change \"Use hooks!\" to an empty string once you're done; this is what we want for our initial state.</p>\n<pre><code>const [name, setName] = useState('');\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#reading_user_input\" title=\"Permalink to Reading user input\">Reading user input</a></h3>\n<p>Before we can change the value of <code>name</code>, we need to capture a user's input as they type. For this, we can listen to the <code>onChange</code> event. Let's write a <code>handleChange()</code> function, and listen for it on the <code>&#x3C;input /></code> tag.</p>\n<pre><code>// near the top of the `Form` component\nfunction handleChange(e) {\n  console.log(\"Typing!\");\n}\n\n// Down in the return statement\n&#x3C;input\n  type=\"text\"\n  id=\"new-todo-input\"\n  className=\"input input__lg\"\n  name=\"text\"\n  autoComplete=\"off\"\n  value={name}\n  onChange={handleChange}\n/>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Currently, your input's value will not change as you type, but your browser will log the word \"Typing!\" to the JavaScript console, so we know our event listener is attached to the input. In order to change the input's value, we have to use our <code>handleChange()</code> function to update our <code>name</code> state.</p>\n<p>To read the contents of the input field as they change, you can access the input's <code>value</code> property. We can do this inside <code>handleChange()</code> by reading <code>e.target.value</code>. <code>e.target</code> represents the element that fired the <code>change</code> event — that's our input. So, <code>value</code> is the text inside it.</p>\n<p>You can <code>console.log()</code> this value to see it in your browser's console.</p>\n<pre><code>function handleChange(e) {\n  console.log(e.target.value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#updating_state\" title=\"Permalink to Updating state\">Updating state</a></h3>\n<p>Logging isn't enough — we want to actually store the updated state of the name as the input value changes! Change the <code>console.log()</code> to <code>setName()</code>, as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code>function handleChange(e) {\n  setName(e.target.value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we need to change our <code>handleSubmit()</code> function so that it calls <code>props.addTask</code> with name as an argument — remember our callback prop? This will serve to send the task back to the <code>App</code> component, so we can add it to our list of tasks at some later date. As a matter of good practice, you should clear the input after your form submits, so we'll call <code>setName()</code> again with an empty string to do so:</p>\n<pre><code>function handleSubmit(e) {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  props.addTask(name);\n  setName(\"\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>At last, you can type something into the input field in your browser and click <em>Add</em> — whatever you typed will appear in an alert dialog.</p>\n<p>Your <code>Form.js</code> file should now read like this:</p>\n<pre><code>import React, { useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction Form(props) {\n  const [name, setName] = useState(\"\");\n\n  function handleChange(e) {\n    setName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  function handleSubmit(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    props.addTask(name);\n    setName(\"\");\n  }\n  return (\n    &#x3C;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      &#x3C;h2 className=\"label-wrapper\">\n        &#x3C;label htmlFor=\"new-todo-input\" className=\"label__lg\">\n          What needs to be done?\n        &#x3C;/label>\n      &#x3C;/h2>\n      &#x3C;input\n        type=\"text\"\n        id=\"new-todo-input\"\n        className=\"input input__lg\"\n        name=\"text\"\n        autoComplete=\"off\"\n        value={name}\n        onChange={handleChange}\n      />\n      &#x3C;button type=\"submit\" className=\"btn btn__primary btn__lg\">\n        Add\n      &#x3C;/button>\n    &#x3C;/form>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Form;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> One thing you'll notice is that you are able to submit empty tasks by just pressing the Add button without entering a task name. Can you think of a way to disallow empty tasks from being added? As a hint, you probably need to add some kind of check into the <code>handleSubmit()</code> function.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#putting_it_all_together_adding_a_task\" title=\"Permalink to Putting it all together: Adding a task\">Putting it all together: Adding a task</a></h2>\n<p>Now that we've practiced with events, callback props, and hooks we're ready to write functionality that will allow a user to add a new task from their browser.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#tasks_as_state\" title=\"Permalink to Tasks as state\">Tasks as state</a></h3>\n<p>Import <code>useState</code> into <code>App.js</code>, so that we can store our tasks in state — update your <code>React</code> import line to the following:</p>\n<pre><code>import React, { useState } from \"react\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>We want to pass <code>props.tasks</code> into the <code>useState()</code> hook – this will preserve its initial state.

There's one problem however: we can't just pass the <code>name</code> argument of <code>addTask()</code> into <code>setTasks</code>, because <code>tasks</code> is an array of objects and <code>name</code> is a string. If we tried to do this, the array would be replaced with the string.</p>\n<p>First of all, we need to put <code>name</code> into an object that has the same structure as our existing tasks. Inside of the <code>addTask()</code> function, we will make a <code>newTask</code> object to add to the array.</p>\n<p>We then need to make a new array with this new task added to it and then update the state of the tasks data to this new state. To do this, we can use spread syntax to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax#copy_an_array\">copy the existing array</a>, and add our object at the end. We then pass this array into <code>setTasks()</code> to update the state.</p>\n<p>Putting that all together, your <code>addTask()</code> function should read like so:</p>\n<pre><code>function addTask(name) {\n  const newTask = { id: \"id\", name: name, completed: false };\n  setTasks([...tasks, newTask]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you can use the browser to add a task to our data! Type anything into the form and click \"Add\" (or press the Enter key) and you'll see your new todo item appear in the UI!</p>\n<p><strong>However, we have another problem</strong>: our <code>addTask()</code> function is giving each task the same <code>id</code>. This is bad for accessibility, and makes it impossible for React to tell future tasks apart with the <code>key</code> prop. In fact, React will give you a warning in your DevTools console — \"Warning: Encountered two children with the same key...\"</p>\n<p>We need to fix this. Making unique identifiers is a hard problem – one for which the JavaScript community has written some helpful libraries. We'll use <a href=\"https://github.com/ai/nanoid\">nanoid</a> because it's tiny, and it works.</p>\n<p>Make sure you're in the root directory of your application and run the following terminal command:</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're using yarn, you'll need the following instead: <code>yarn add nanoid</code></p>\n<p>Now we can import <code>nanoid</code> into the top of <code>App.js</code> so we can use it to create unique IDs for our new tasks. First of all, include the following import line at the top of <code>App.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>import { nanoid } from \"nanoid\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let's update <code>addTask()</code> so that each task ID becomes a prefix todo- plus a unique string generated by nanoid. Update your <code>newTask</code> constant declaration to this:</p>\n<pre><code>const newTask = { id: \"todo-\" + nanoid(), name: name, completed: false };\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save everything, and try your app again — now you can add tasks without getting that warning about duplicate IDs.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_events_state#detour_counting_tasks\" title=\"Permalink to Detour: counting tasks\">Detour: counting tasks</a></h2>\n<p>Now that we can add new tasks, you may notice a problem: our heading reads 3 tasks remaining, no matter how many tasks we have!

This function will have an <code>id</code> parameter, but we're not going to use it yet. For now, we'll log the first task in the array to the console – we're going to inspect what happens when we check or uncheck it in our browser:</p>\n<p>Add this just above your <code>taskList</code> constant declaration:</p>\n<pre><code>function toggleTaskCompleted(id) {\n  console.log(tasks[0])\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we'll add <code>toggleTaskCompleted</code> to the props of each <code>&#x3C;Todo /></code> component rendered inside our <code>taskList</code>; update it like so:</p>\n<pre><code>const taskList = tasks.map(task => (\n  &#x3C;Todo\n      id={task.id}\n      name={task.name}\n      completed={task.completed}\n      key={task.id}\n      toggleTaskCompleted={toggleTaskCompleted}\n  />\n));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, go over to your <code>Todo.js</code> component and add an <code>onChange</code> handler to your <code>&#x3C;input /></code> element, which should use an anonymous function to call <code>props.toggleTaskCompleted()</code> with a parameter of <code>props.id</code>. The <code>&#x3C;input /></code> should now look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;input\n  id={props.id}\n  type=\"checkbox\"\n  defaultChecked={props.completed}\n  onChange={() => props.toggleTaskCompleted(props.id)}\n/>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save everything and return to your browser and notice that our first task, Eat, is checked. Open your JavaScript console, then click on the checkbox next to Eat. It unchecks, as we expect. Your JavaScript console, however, will log something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Object { id: \"task-0\", name: \"Eat\", completed: true }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The checkbox unchecks in the browser, but our console tells us that Eat is still completed.

We can test each task, and exclude a task from the new array if its <code>id</code> prop matches the <code>id</code> parameter passed into <code>deleteTask()</code>.</p>\n<p>Update the <code>deleteTask()</code> function inside your <code>App.js</code> file as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>function deleteTask(id) {\n  const remainingTasks = tasks.filter(task => id !== task.id);\n  setTasks(remainingTasks);\n}\n</code></pre>"}
