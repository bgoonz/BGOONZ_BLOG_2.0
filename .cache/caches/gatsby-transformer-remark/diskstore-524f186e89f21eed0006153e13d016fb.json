Here are my personal extension preferences for VS Code as a JavaScript developer:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ESLint <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint\">ESLint</a> turns the popular JavaScript linter into an extension of VS Code. It automatically reads your linting configuration, identifies problems and even fixes them for you, if you want.</li>\n<li>GitLens <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens\">GitLens</a> is a very powerful collaboration tool for VS Code. It provides many useful tools for git such as blame, code authorship, activity heatmaps, recent changes, file history and even commit search.</li>\n<li>Debugger for Chrome <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome\">Debugger for Chrome</a> allows you to debug your JavaScript code in Chrome or Chromium. Breakpoints, call stack inspection and stepping inside a function are only some of its features.</li>\n<li>Bracket Pair Colorizer 2 <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2\">Bracket Pair Colorizer 2</a> makes reading code faster as it makes matching brackets the same color. This extension for VS Code improves upon its predecessor by providing improved performance.</li>\n<li>Bookmarks <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks\">Bookmarks</a> is one of those extensions that will significantly reduce your time jumping between different files, as it allows you to save important positions and navigate back to them easily and quickly.</li>\n<li>TODO Highlight <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight\">TODO Highlight</a> simplifies tracking leftover tasks by allowing you to list all of your TODO annotations, as well as adding a handy background highlight to them to make them pop out immediately.</li>\n<li>Live Server <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer\">Live Server</a> gives you an easy way to serve web pages from VS Code, making previewing and debugging a lot easier. One of the core features is the live reload support that many developers are used to.</li>\n<li>REST Client <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client\">REST Client</a> allows you to send HTTP requests and view the responses directly in VS Code. This extension supports a wide range of formats and authorization and should work with most setups.</li>\n<li>One Dark Pro <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zhuangtongfa.Material-theme\">One Dark Pro</a> is one of the most popular VS Code themes and with very good reason. It provides a clean theme with a nice palette that has great contrast and is very comfortable to use on a daily basis.</li>\n<li>Fira Code <a href=\"https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode\">Fira Code</a> is not a traditional VS Code extension and might take a couple more steps to set up, but it’s a superb programming font with ligatures that will help you scan code faster once you get used to it.</li>\n</ol>"}
