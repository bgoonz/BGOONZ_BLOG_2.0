My contribution was the following analogy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine an enormous speaker, mounted on a pole, playing a repeating sound. The speaker is so large, you can see the cone move back and forth with the sound. Mark a point on the cone, and now rotate the pole. Trace the point from an above-ground view, if the resulting squiggly curve is off-center, then there is frequency corresponding the pole's rotational frequency represented in the sound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr Bill Connelly from Australia National University has created an interactive simulation of the analogy. Here, the sound from the speaker is a chord of two tones: just enter their frequency and amplitude, and see how the DFT is calculated from the analysis of the rotation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.billconnelly.net/?p=276\"><img src=\"https://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b01bb08743789970d-800wi\" alt=\"DFT\" title=\"DFT\"></a></p>"}
