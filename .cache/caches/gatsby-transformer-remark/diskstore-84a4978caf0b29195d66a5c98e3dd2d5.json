    "val": "<h1>Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm Explained (Python)</h1>\n<p>In this world which is getting dominated by Internet of Things (IoT), there is an increasing need to understand signals from devices installed in households, shopping malls, factories and offices. For example, any voice assistant detects, authenticates and interprets commands from humans even if it is slow or fast. Our voice tone tends to be different during different times of the day. In the early morning after we get up from bed, we interact with a slower, heavier and lazier tone compared to other times of the day. These devices treat the signals as time series and compare the peaks, troughs and slopes by taking into account the varying lags and phases in the signals to come up with a similarity score. One of the most common algorithms used to accomplish this is <em>Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)</em>. It is a very robust technique to compare two or more Time Series by ignoring any shifts and speed.</p>\n<p>As part of Walmart Real Estate team, I am working on understanding the energy consumption pattern of different assets like refrigeration units, dehumidifiers, lighting, etc. installed in the retail stores.This will help in improving quality of data collected from IoT sensors, detect and prevent faults in the systems and improve energy consumption forecasting and planning. This analysis involves time series of energy consumption during different times of a day i.e. different days of a week, weeks of a month and months of a year. Time series forecasting often gives bad predictions when there is sudden shift in phase of the energy consumption due to unknown factors. For example if the defrost schedule, items refresh routine for a refrigeration unit, or weather changes suddenly and are not captured to explain the phase shifts of energy consumption, it is important to detect these change points.</p>\n<p>In the example below, the items refresh routine of a store has shifted by 2 hours on Tuesday leading the shift in peak energy consumption of refrigeration units and this information was not available to us for many such stores.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*WEe7LQivzU4YOvDCe0_P_A.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*WEe7LQivzU4YOvDCe0_P_A.png\"></p>\n<p>The peak at 2 am got shifted to 4 am. DTW when run recursively for consecutive days can identify the cases for which phase shift occurred without much change in shape of signals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/52/1*jDuu7XE8XitCTBSythQICw.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*jDuu7XE8XitCTBSythQICw.png\"></p>\n<p>The training data can be restricted to Tuesday onwards to improve the prediction of energy consumption in future in this case as phase shift was detected on Tuesday. The setup improved the predictions substantially ( > 50%) for the stores for which the reason of shift was not known. This was not possible by traditional ways of one to one comparison of signals.</p>\n<p>In this blog, I will explain how DTW algorithm works and throw some light on the calculation of the similarity score between two time series and its implementation in python. Most of the contents in this blog have been sourced from this <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1163055\">paper</a>, also mentioned in the references section below.</p>\n<p>2. Why do we need DTW ?</p>\n<p>Any two time series can be compared using euclidean distance or other similar distances on a one to one basis on time axis. The amplitude of first time series at time T will be compared with amplitude of second time series at time T. This will result into a very poor comparison and similarity score even if the two time series are very similar in shape but out of phase in time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*HQleh0-1HlGsLkVlcaFRLw.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*HQleh0-1HlGsLkVlcaFRLw.png\"></p>\n<p>DTW compares amplitude of first signal at time T with amplitude of second signal at time T+1 and T-1 or T+2 and T-2. This makes sure it does not give low similarity score for signals with similar shape and different phase.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*6Yzt8SiQ-kTRx8pFqDZXkw.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*6Yzt8SiQ-kTRx8pFqDZXkw.png\"></p>\n<p>3. How it works?</p>\n<p>Let us take two time series signals P and Q</p>\n<p>Series 1 (P) : 1,4,5,10,9,3,2,6,8,4</p>\n<p>Series 2 (Q): 1,7,3,4,1,10,5,4,7,4</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*x8-vv9W3cfmdd0mW_1MLTg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*x8-vv9W3cfmdd0mW_1MLTg.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Step 1 :</em> Empty Cost Matrix Creation</p>\n<p>Create an empty cost matrix M with x and y labels as amplitudes of the two series to be compared.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*MrjHYFHyeeE3aiBEA-E5cw.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*MrjHYFHyeeE3aiBEA-E5cw.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Step 2: Cost Calculation</em></p>\n<p>Fill the cost matrix using the formula mentioned below starting from left and bottom corner.</p>\n<p>M(i, j) = |P(i) --- Q(j)| + min ( M(i-1,j-1), M(i, j-1), M(i-1,j) )</p>\n<p>where</p>\n<p>M is the matrix</p>\n<p>i is the iterator for series P</p>\n<p>j is the iterator for series Q</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hhpagt7BEeFU22X83Q76yQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*hhpagt7BEeFU22X83Q76yQ.png\"></p>\n<p>Let us take few examples (11,3 and 8 ) to illustrate the calculation as highlighted in the below table.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bHaMHM9eBfLc6q166iiI9g.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*bHaMHM9eBfLc6q166iiI9g.png\"></p>\n<p>for 11,</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*dzBbhICP6wqwtmW-GGwGmg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*dzBbhICP6wqwtmW-GGwGmg.png\"></p>\n<p>|10 --4| + min( 5, 12, 5 )</p>\n<p>= 6 + 5</p>\n<p>= 11</p>\n<p>Similarly for 3,</p>\n<p>|4 --1| + min( 0 )</p>\n<p>= 3+ 0</p>\n<p>= 3</p>\n<p>and for 8,</p>\n<p>|1 --3| + min( 6)</p>\n<p>= 2 + 6</p>\n<p>= 8</p>\n<p>The full table will look like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*7pphf0WWYElhtohnQPFPNA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*7pphf0WWYElhtohnQPFPNA.png\"></p>\n<p><em>Step 3:</em> Warping Path Identification</p>\n<p>Identify the warping path starting from top right corner of the matrix and traversing to bottom left.

It is a method to calculate the optimal matching between two sequences. DTW is useful in many domains such as speech recognition, data mining, financial markets, etc. It's commonly used in data mining to measure the distance between two time-series.</p>\n<p>In this post, we will go over the mathematics behind DTW. Then, two illustrative examples are provided to better understand the concept. If you are not interested in the math behind it, please jump to examples.</p>\n<h1>Formulation</h1>\n<p>Let's assume we have two sequences like the following:</p>\n<p><em>𝑋=𝑥[1], 𝑥[2], ..., x[i], ..., x[n]</em></p>\n<p><em>Y=y[1], y[2], ..., y[j], ..., y[m]</em></p>\n<p>The sequences 𝑋 and 𝑌 can be arranged to form an 𝑛-by-𝑚 grid, where each point (𝑖, j) is the alignment between 𝑥[𝑖] and 𝑦[𝑗].</p>\n<p>A warping path 𝑊 maps the elements of 𝑋 and 𝑌 to minimize the <em>distance</em> between them. 𝑊 is a sequence of grid points (𝑖, 𝑗). We will see an example of the warping path later.</p>\n<h2>Warping Path and DTW distance</h2>\n<p>The Optimal path to (𝑖<em>𝑘, 𝑗</em>𝑘) can be computed by:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*8hJEJWuxrccwCMuUG_aPbQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*8hJEJWuxrccwCMuUG_aPbQ.png\"></p>\n<p>where 𝑑 is the Euclidean distance. Then, the overall path cost can be calculated as</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2OGDOJ-a0zTO_9T1FIGejQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/272/1*2OGDOJ-a0zTO_9T1FIGejQ.png\"></p>\n<h1>Restrictions on the Warping function</h1>\n<p>The warping path is found using a dynamic programming approach to align two sequences. Going through all possible paths is \"combinatorically explosive\" [1]. Therefore, for efficiency purposes, it's important to limit the number of possible warping paths, and hence the following constraints are outlined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boundary Condition: This constraint ensures that the warping path begins with the start points of both signals and terminates with their endpoints.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SHsmQu2TqpaDyIArn2snzg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/452/1*SHsmQu2TqpaDyIArn2snzg.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monotonicity condition: This constraint preserves the time-order of points (not going back in time).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*RNg2VENGaWoyvGrvyeg61A.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/311/1*RNg2VENGaWoyvGrvyeg61A.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuity (step size) condition: This constraint limits the path transitions to adjacent points in time (not jumping in time).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lU99pFyomdPeaHuR26bDyA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/418/1*lU99pFyomdPeaHuR26bDyA.png\"></p>\n<p>In addition to the above three constraints, there are other less frequent conditions for an allowable warping path:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warping window condition: Allowable points can be restricted to fall within a given warping window of width 𝜔 (a positive integer).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9apgwkXeU3gOHLudFsIosA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/168/1*9apgwkXeU3gOHLudFsIosA.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slope condition: The warping path can be constrained by restricting the slope, and consequently avoiding extreme movements in one direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An acceptable warping path has combinations of chess king moves that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Horizontal moves: (𝑖, 𝑗) → (𝑖, 𝑗+1)</li>\n<li>Vertical moves: (𝑖, 𝑗) → (𝑖+1, 𝑗)</li>\n<li>Diagonal moves: (𝑖, 𝑗) → (𝑖+1, 𝑗+1)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Implementation</h1>\n<p>Let's import all python packages we need.</p>\n<p>import pandas as pd<br>\nimport numpy as np# Plotting Packages<br>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>\nimport seaborn as sbn# Configuring Matplotlib<br>\nimport matplotlib as mpl<br>\nmpl.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 300<br>\nsavefig<em>options = dict(format=\"png\", dpi=300, bbox</em>inches=\"tight\")# Computation packages<br>\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean<br>\nfrom fastdtw import fastdtw</p>\n<p>Let's define a method to compute the accumulated cost matrix <em>D</em> for the warp path. The cost matrix uses the Euclidean distance to calculate the distance between every two points. The methods to compute the Euclidean distance matrix and accumulated cost matrix are defined below:</p>\n<h1>Example 1</h1>\n<p>In this example, we have two sequences <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> with different lengths.</p>\n<h1>Create two sequences\\</h1>\n<p>x = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1]<br>\ny = [2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 0]</p>\n<p>We cannot calculate the Euclidean distance between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> since they don't have equal lengths.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ADzLGLGGq13onO72EO_ZpQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*ADzLGLGGq13onO72EO_ZpQ.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 1: Euclidean distance between x and y (is it possible? 🤔) (Image by Author)</p>\n<h1>Compute DTW distance and warp path</h1>\n<p>Many Python packages calculate the DTW by just providing the sequences and the type of distance (usually Euclidean). Here, we use a popular Python implementation of DTW that is <a href=\"https://github.com/slaypni/fastdtw\">FastDTW</a> which is an approximate DTW algorithm with lower time and memory complexities [2].</p>\n<p>dtw<em>distance, warp</em>path = fastdtw(x, y, dist=euclidean)</p>\n<p>Note that we are using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/scipy/\">SciPy</a>'s distance function <em>Euclidean</em> that we imported earlier. For a better understanding of the warp path, let's first compute the accumulated cost matrix and then visualize the path on a grid. The following code will plot a heatmap of the accumulated cost matrix.</p>\n<p>cost<em>matrix = compute</em>accumulated<em>cost</em>matrix(x, y)</p>\n<p>Example 1: Python code to plot (and save) the heatmap of the accumulated cost matrix</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/54/1*PIKZAwsV15NBvqkh9N1KMg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/375/1*PIKZAwsV15NBvqkh9N1KMg.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 1: Accumulated cost matrix and warping path (Image by Author)</p>\n<p>The color bar shows the cost of each point in the grid. As can be seen, the warp path (blue line) is going through the lowest cost on the grid. Let's see the DTW distance and the warping path by printing these two variables.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DTW distance: 6.0<br>\nWarp path: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The warping path starts at point (0, 0) and ends at (4, 6) by 6 moves. Let's also calculate the accumulated cost most using the functions we defined earlier and compare the values with the heatmap.</p>\n<p>cost<em>matrix = compute</em>accumulated<em>cost</em>matrix(x, y)<br>\nprint(np.flipud(cost_matrix)) # Flipping the cost matrix for easier comparison with heatmap values!>>> [[32. 12. 10. 10.  6.]<br>\n[23. 11.  6.  6.  5.]<br>\n[19. 11.  5.  5.  9.]<br>\n[19.  7.  4.  5.  8.]<br>\n[19.  3.  6. 10.  4.]<br>\n[10.  2.  6.  6.  3.]<br>\n[ 1.  2.  2.  2.  3.]]</p>\n<p>The cost matrix is printed above has similar values to the heatmap.</p>\n<p>Now let's plot the two sequences and connect the mapping points. The code to plot the DTW distance between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is given below.</p>\n<p>Example 1: Python code to plot (and save) the DTW distance between x and y</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bF9I-49iVW9b2MvDbRBZxA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*bF9I-49iVW9b2MvDbRBZxA.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 1: DTW distance between x and y (Image by Author)</p>\n<h1>Example 2</h1>\n<p>In this example, we will use two sinusoidal signals and see how they will be matched by calculating the DTW distance between them.</p>\n<p>Example 2: Generate two sinusoidal signals (x1 and x2) with different lengths</p>\n<p>Just like Example 1, let's calculate the DTW distance and the warp path for *x1 *and *x2 *signals using FastDTW package.</p>\n<p>distance, warp_path = fastdtw(x1, x2, dist=euclidean)</p>\n<p>Example 2: Python code to plot (and save) the DTW distance between x1 and x2</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Bzubc5uGFXd_-Sj7W_QFjg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*Bzubc5uGFXd_-Sj7W_QFjg.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 2: DTW distance between x1 and x2 (Image by Author)</p>\n<p>As can be seen in above figure, the DTW distance between the two signals is particularly powerful when the signals have similar patterns. The extrema (maximum and minimum points) between the two signals are correctly mapped. Moreover, unlike Euclidean distance, we may see many-to-one mapping when DTW distance is used, particularly if the two signals have different lengths.</p>\n<p>You may spot an issue with dynamic time warping from the figure above. Can you guess what it is?</p>\n<p>The issue is around the head and tail of time-series that do not properly match. This is because the DTW algorithm cannot afford the warping invariance for at the endpoints. In short, the effect of this is that a small difference at the sequence endpoints will tend to contribute disproportionately to the estimated similarity[3].</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>DTW is an algorithm to find an optimal alignment between two sequences and a useful distance metric to have in our toolbox. This technique is useful when we are working with two non-linear sequences, particularly if one sequence is a non-linear stretched/shrunk version of the other. The warping path is a combination of \"chess king\" moves that starts from the head of two sequences and ends with their tails.</p>\n<p>You can find the Jupyter notebook for this blog post <a href=\"https://github.com/e-alizadeh/medium/blob/master/notebooks/intro_to_dtw.ipynb\">here</a>.

DTW has been applied to temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphics data --- indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear sequence can be analysed with DTW.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>The idea to compare arrays with different length is to build one-to-many and many-to-one matches so that the total distance can be minimised between the two.</em></p>\n<p>Suppose we have two different arrays red and blue with different length:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/42/1*uFicSZjqkNBfsyrsJw7J9g.jpeg?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/612/1*uFicSZjqkNBfsyrsJw7J9g.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>Clearly these two series follow the same pattern, but the blue curve is longer than the red. If we apply the one-to-one match, shown in the top, the mapping is not perfectly synced up and the tail of the blue curve is being left out.</p>\n<p>DTW overcomes the issue by developing a one-to-many match so that the troughs and peaks with the same pattern are perfectly matched, and there is no left out for both curves(shown in the bottom top).</p>\n<h1>Rules</h1>\n<p>In general, DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g. time series) with certain restriction and rules(comes from wiki):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every index from the first sequence must be matched with one or more indices from the other sequence and vice versa</li>\n<li>The first index from the first sequence must be matched with the first index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)</li>\n<li>The last index from the first sequence must be matched with the last index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)</li>\n<li>The mapping of the indices from the first sequence to indices from the other sequence must be monotonically increasing, and vice versa, i.e. if <code>j > i</code> are indices from the first sequence, then there must not be two indices <code>l > k</code> in the other sequence, such that index <code>i</code> is matched with index <code>l</code> and index <code>j</code> is matched with index <code>k</code> , and vice versa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The optimal match is denoted by the match that satisfies all the restrictions and the rules and that has the minimal cost, where the cost is computed as the sum of absolute differences, for each matched pair of indices, between their values.</p>\n<p>To summarise is that <em>head and tail must be positionally matched, no cross-match and no left out.</em></p>\n<h1>Implementation</h1>\n<p>The implementation of the algorithm looks extremely concise:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*fGr2Mj7fEB7tEyqAzcp2LA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*fGr2Mj7fEB7tEyqAzcp2LA.png\"></p>\n<p>where <code>DTW[i, j]</code> is the distance between <code>s[1:i]</code> and <code>t[1:j]</code> with the best alignment.</p>\n<p>The key lies in:</p>\n<p>DTW[i, j] := cost + minimum(DTW[i-1, j ],<br>\nDTW[i , j-1],<br>\nDTW[i-1, j-1])</p>\n<p>Which is saying that the cost of between two arrays with length <code>i and j</code> equals <em>the distance between the tails + the minimum of cost in arrays with length *`</em>i-1, j<em><code>_ , _</code></em>i, j-1<em><code>_ , and _</code></em>i-1, j-1*`_ ._</p>\n<p>Put it in python would be:</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*eogOkXkOUzi6Cq7U9BgiLg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*eogOkXkOUzi6Cq7U9BgiLg.png\"></p>\n<p>The distance between <code>a and b</code> would be the last element of the matrix, which is 2.</p>\n<h2>Add Window Constraint</h2>\n<p>One issue of the above algorithm is that we allow one element in an array to match an unlimited number of elements in the other array(as long as the tail can match in the end), this would cause the mapping to bent over a lot, for example, the following array:</p>\n<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>\nb = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, ..., 5]</p>\n<p>To minimise the distance, the element 2 in array <code>a</code> would match all the 2 in array <code>b</code> , which causes an array <code>b</code> to bent severely. To avoid this, we can add a window constraint to limit the number of elements one can match:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*0_xypte7FHDWJuuBexEvHg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*0_xypte7FHDWJuuBexEvHg.png\"></p>\n<p>The key difference is that now each element is confined to match elements in range <code>i --- w</code> and <code>i + w</code> . The <code>w := max(w, abs(n-m))</code> guarantees all indices can be matched up.</p>\n<p>The implementation and example would be:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2K6C-3QrRmbbhpe-jt9UQA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*2K6C-3QrRmbbhpe-jt9UQA.png\"></p>\n<h1>Apply a Package</h1>\n<p>There is also contributed packages available on Pypi to use directly. Here I demonstrate an example using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/fastdtw/\">fastdtw</a>:</p>\n<p>It gives you the distance of two lists and index mapping(the example can extend to a multi-dimension array).</p>"
