HTML5 was a big change in the way that the standard was put together and followed a long break in the development of standards for HTML: HTML 4.0.1 was last updated in 2000, HTML5 was finally released in 2012. The goal of HTML5 was to standardise current practice in browsers, rather than to define new structures or limit what was possible. The W3C worked with the browser developers to agree on standards for new technologies that they had introduced. For example, being able to include audio and video elements in HTML had been possible in some browsers; HTML5 defined a standard for these that all browser vendors could agree on and implement.","position":{"start":{"line":169,"column":1,"offset":29254},"end":{"line":169,"column":766,"offset":30019},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":169,"column":1,"offset":29254},"end":{"line":169,"column":766,"offset":30019},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":170,"column":1,"offset":30020}}}}
