We will use PostgreSQL, or postgres , primarily for our RDBMS and it will be able to create individual databases for each of our projects.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Describe what relational data is</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"d8fd\">In general, relational data is information that is connected to other pieces of information.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"2fa8\">When working with relational databases, we can connect two entries together utilizing foreign keys (explained below).</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"e199\">In a pets database, we could be keeping track of dogs and cats as well as the toys that each of them own. That ownership of a cat to a toy is the relational aspect of relational data. Two pieces of information that can be connected together to show some sort of meaning.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Define what a database is</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"06fe\">The actual location that data is stored.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"78c5\">A database can be made up of many tables that each store specific kinds of information.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"f752\">We could have a pets database that stores information about many different types of animals. Each animal type could potentially be represented by a different table.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Define what a database table is</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"04ae\">Within a database, a table stores one specific kind of information.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"3878\">The records (entries) on these tables can be connected to records on other tables through the use of foreign keys</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"d6f9\">In our pets database, we could have a dogs table, with individual records</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Describe the purpose of a primary key</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"4d0e\">A primary key is used in the database as a unique identifier for the table.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"8fb0\">We often use an id field that simply increments with each entry. The incrementing ensures that each record has a unique identifier, even if their are other fields of the record that are repeated (two people with the same name would still need to have a unique identifier, for example).</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"8876\">With a unique identifier, we can easily connect records within the table to records from other tables.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Describe the purpose of a foreign key</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"cf54\">A foreign key is used as the connector from this record to the primary key of another table s record.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"f397\">In our pets example, we can imagine two tables to demonstrate: a table to represent cats and a table to represent toys. Each of these tables has a primary key of id that is used as the unique identifier. In order to make a connection between a toy and a cat, we can add another field to the cat table called owner<em>id , indicating that it is a foreign key for the cat table. By setting a toy s owner</em>id to the same value as a particular cat s id , we can indicate that the cat is the owner of that toy.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Describe how to properly name things in PostgreSQL</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"d6e6\">Names within postgres should generally consist of only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"0fb3\">Tables within a database are plural by convention, so a table for cats would typically be cats and office locations would be office_locations (all lowercase, underscores to replace spaces, plural)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Connect to an instance of PostgreSQL with the command line tool psql</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"1b7f\">The psql command by default will try to connect to a database and username that matches your system s username</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"1454\">We connect to a different database by providing an argument to the psql command</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"3439\">psql pets</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"fb37\">To connect with a different username we can use the -U flag followed by the username we would like to use. To connect to the pets database as pets_user</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"d357\">psql -U pets_user pets</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"e139\">If there is a password for the user, we can tell psql that we would like a prompt for the password to show up by using the -W flag.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"8709\">psql -U pets<em>user -W pets (the order of our flags doesn t matter, as long as any arguments associated with them are together, such as pets</em>user directly following -U in this example)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Identify whether a user is a normal user or a superuser by the prompt in the psql shell</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"8ff5\">You can tell if you are logged in as a superuser or normal user by the prompt in the terminal.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"de97\">If the prompt shows =>, the user is a normal user</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"7ce3\">If the prompt show =#, the user is a superuser</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Create a user for the relational database management system</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"f4dc\">Within psql, we can create a user with the CREATE USER {username} {WITH options} command.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"7eda\">The most common options we ll want to use are WITH PASSWORD ‘mypassword’ to provide a password for the user we are creating, CREATEDB to allow the user to create new databases, or SUPERUSER to create a user with all elevated permissions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Create a database in the database management system</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"3fff\">We can use the command CREATE DATABASE {database name} {options} inside psql to create a new database.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"7d2f\">A popular option we may utilize is WITH OWNER {owner name} to set another user as the owner of the database we are making.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Configure a database so that only the owner (and superusers) can connect to it</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"1a73\">We can GRANT and REVOKE privileges from a database to users or categories of users.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"8795\">In order to remove connection privileges to a database from the public we can use REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE {db_name} FROM PUBLIC;, removing all public connection access.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"ee98\">If we wanted to grant it back, or to a specific user, we could similarly do GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE {db_name} FROM {specific user, PUBLIC, etc.};</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>View a list of databases in an installation of PostgreSQL</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"2111\">To list all databases we can use the \\l or \\list command in psql.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Create tables in a database</strong></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">CREATE TABLE {table name} (\n{columnA} {typeA},\n{columnB} {typeB},\netc…\n);</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"a2fc\">The whitespace does not matter. Creating the SQL statements on multiple lines is easier to read, but just like JavaScript, they can be presented differently.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"a203\">One common issue is that SQL does not like trailing commas, so the last column cannot have a comma after its type in this example.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>View a list of tables in a database</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"964a\">To list all database tables, use the \\dt command.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Identify and describe the common data types used in PostgreSQL</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"a2fd\">There are many different data types that we can use in our tables, here are some common examples:</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"1d53\">SERIAL: autoincrementing, very useful for IDs</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"78ce\">VARCHAR(n): a string with a character limit of n</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"2e02\">TEXT: doesn t have character limit, but less performant</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"c20e\">BOOLEAN: true/false</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"d525\">SMALLINT: signed two-byte integer (-32768 to 32767)</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"6b96\">INTEGER: signed four-byte integer (standard)</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"fa38\">BIGINT: signed eight-byte integer (very large numbers)</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"aa0c\">NUMERIC: or DECIMAL, can store exact decimal values</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"1fb6\">TIMESTAMP: date and time</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Describe the purpose of the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints, and create columns in database tables that have them</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"377b\">In addition to the data type, we can provide flags for constraints to place on our column data.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"bda2\">The UNIQUE flag indicates that the data for the column must not be repeated.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"e14c\">By default we can create entries in our tables that are missing data from columns. When creating a pet, maybe we don t provide an age because we don t know it, for example. If we want to require that the data be present in order to create a new record, we can indicate that column must be NOT NULL.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"6745\">In the example below, we are requiring our pets to have unique names and for them to be present (both UNIQUE and NOT NULL). We have no such constraints on the age column, allowing repetition of ages or their complete absence.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">CREATE TABLE pets (\nid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\nname VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\nage SMALLINT\n);</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>Create a primary key for a table</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"da50\">When creating a table we can indicate the primary key by passing in the column name to parentheses like so:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">CREATE TABLE people (\nid SERIAL,\nfirst_name VARCHAR(50),\nlast_name VARCHAR(50),\nPRIMARY KEY (id)\n);</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"4871\">We could have also used the PRIMARY KEY flag on the column definition itself:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">CREATE TABLE people (\nid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\nfirst_name VARCHAR(50),\nlast_name VARCHAR(50)\n);</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>Create foreign key constraints to relate tables</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"e576\">In our table definition, we can use the line FOREIGN KEY (foreign<em>key</em>stored<em>in</em>this<em>table) REFERENCE {other table} ({other</em>tables<em>key</em>name}) to connect two tables.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"4c08\">This is probably easier to see in an example:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">CREATE TABLE people (\nid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\nfirst_name VARCHAR(50),\nlast_name VARCHAR(50)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE pets (\nid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\nname VARCHAR(255),\nage SMALLINT,\nperson_id INTEGER,\nFOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES people (id)\n);</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>SQL is not case sensitive for its keywords but is for its entity names</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"7749\">Exactly as the LO states, CREATE TABLE and create table are interpreted the same way.

We can clear out any records that we have by dropping all of our tables, then just run our seed files to get it into a predetermined starting point. This is great for our personal projects, testing environments, starting values for new tables we create, etc.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"22c5\">There are two main ways we can use a seed file with psql, the &#x3C; and the | operators.

What data are are you storing, what are the fields for each entity?</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"cd73\">You can think of this in similar ways to OOP (object oriented programming).</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"0cf7\">If you wanted to model this information using classes, what classes would you make? Those are generally going to be the tables that are created in your database.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"57f4\">The attributes of your classes are generally going to be the fields/columns that we need for each table.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"0681\">Identify primary keys. Most of the time these will be ids that you can generate as a serial field, incrementing with each addition to the database.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"99da\">Establish table relationships. Connect related data together with foreign keys. Know how we store these keys in a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"c8c4\">With a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship, we are able to use a foreign key on the table to indicate the other specific record that it is connected to.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"2e56\">With a many-to-many relationship, each record could be connected to multiple records, so we have to create a join table to connect these entities. A record on this join table connects a record from one table to a record from another table.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How to use transactions to group multiple SQL commands into one succeed or fail operation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"6bfa\">We can define an explicit transaction using BEGIN and ending with either COMMIT or ROLLBACK.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"0c34\">If any command inside the block fails, everything will be rolled back. We can also specify that we want to roll back at the end of the block instead of committing. We saw that this can be useful when analyzing operations that would manipulate our database.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">BEGIN;\nUPDATE accounts SET balance = balance — 100.00\nWHERE name = ‘Alice’;\nUPDATE branches SET balance = balance — 100.00\nWHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‘Alice’);\nUPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00\nWHERE name = ‘Bob’;\nUPDATE branches SET balance = balance + 100.00\nWHERE name = (SELECT branch_name FROM accounts WHERE name = ‘Bob’);\nCOMMIT;\n\nBEGIN;\nEXPLAIN ANALYZE\nUPDATE cities\nSET city = ‘New York City’\nWHERE city = ‘New York’;\nROLLBACK;</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>How to apply indexes to tables to improve performance</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"704c\">An index can help optimize queries that we have to run regularly. If we are constantly looking up records in a table by a particular field (such as username or phone number), we can add an index in order to speed up this process.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"142a\">An index maintains a sorted version of the field with a reference to the record that it points to in the table (via primary key). If we want to find a record based on a field that we have an index for, we can look through this index in a more efficient manner than having to scan through the entire table (generally O(log n) since the index is sorted, instead of O(n) for a sequential scan).</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"2c8f\">To add an index to a field we can use the following syntax:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"a6d3\">To drop an index we can do the following:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">DROP INDEX index_name</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"12fa\">Making an index is not always the best approach.

Sequelize will automatically make fields for an id, createdAt, and updatedAt, as well, so we do not need to specify these.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"4d04\">Once our migration file is created, we can go in and edit any details that we need to. Most often we will want to add in database constraints such as allowNull: false, adding a uniqueness constraint with unique: true, adding in character limits to fields such as type: Sequelize.STRING(100), or specifying a foreign key with references to another table references: { model: ‘Categories’ }.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"ca79\">After we make any necessary changes to our migration file, we need to perform the migration, which will run the SQL commands to actually create the table.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">npx sequelize-cli db:migrate</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"78a8\">This command runs any migration files that have not been previously run, in the order that they were created (this is why the timestamp in the file name is important)</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"0790\">If we realize that we made a mistake after migrating, we can undo our previous migration, or all of our migrations. After undoing them, we can make any changes necessary to our migration files (They won t be deleted from the undo, so we don t need to generate anything! Just make the necessary changes to the files that already exist and save the files.).

This file is what allows sequelize to transform the results of its SQL queries into useful JavaScript objects for us.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"5c70\">The model is where we can specify a validation that we want to perform before trying to run a SQL query.

data using the <code class=\"language-text\">findByPk</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">findOne</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">findAll</code> methods. First, make sure you import the models in your JavaScript file. In this case, we are assuming your JavaScript file is in the root of your project and so is the models folder.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const { Recipe, Ingredient, Instruction, MeasurementUnit } = require('./models');</code></pre></div>\n<p>The models folder exports each of the models that you have created. We have these four in our data model, so we will destructure the models to access each table individually. The associations that you have defined in each of your models will allow you to access data of related tables when you query your database using the <code class=\"language-text\">include</code> option.</p>\n<p>If you want to find all recipes, for the recipe list, you would use the <code class=\"language-text\">findAll</code> method. You need to await this, so make sure your function is async.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">async function findAllRecipes() {\n\nreturn await Recipe.findAll();\n\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you would like to include all the ingredients so you can create a shopping list for all the recipes, you would use <code class=\"language-text\">include</code>. This is possible because of the association you have defined in your Recipe and Ingredient models.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">async function getShoppingList() {\n\nreturn await Recipe.findAll({ include: [ Ingredient ] });\n\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you only want to find one where there is chicken in the ingredients list, you would use <code class=\"language-text\">findOne</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">findByPk</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">async function findAChickenRecipe() {\n\nconst chickenRecipe = await Ingredient.findOne({\n\nwhere: {\n\nfoodStuff: 'chicken'\n\n}\n\n});\n\nreturn await Recipe.findByPk(chickenRecipe.recipeId);\n\n}</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Data Access to Create/Update/Delete Rows</h3>\n<p>You have two options when you want to create a row in a table (where you are saving one record into the table). You can either <code class=\"language-text\">.build</code> the row and then <code class=\"language-text\">.save</code> it, or you can <code class=\"language-text\">.create</code> it. Either way it does the same thing. Here are some examples:</p>\n<p>Let’s say we have a form that accepts the name of the recipe (for simplicity). When we get the results of the form, we can:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const newRecipe = await Recipe.build({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });\n\nawait newRecipe.save();</code></pre></div>\n<p>This just created our new recipe and added it to our Recipes table. You can do the same thing like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">await Recipe.create({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' });</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you want to modify an item in your table, you can use <code class=\"language-text\">update</code>. Let's say we want to change the chicken noodle soup to chicken noodle soup with extra veggies, first we need to get the recipe, then we can update it.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const modRecipe = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup' } });\n\nawait modRecipe.update({ title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' });</code></pre></div>\n<p>To delete an item from your table, you will do the same kind of process. Find the recipe you want to delete and <code class=\"language-text\">destroy</code> it, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const deleteThis = await Recipe.findOne({ where: { title: 'Chicken Noodle Soup with Extra Veggies' } });\n\nawait deleteThis.destroy();</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you do not await these, you will receive a promise, so you will need to use <code class=\"language-text\">.then</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">.catch</code> to do more with the items you are accessing and modifying.</p>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>For the data types and validations in your models, here are the official docs. The sequelize docs are hard to look at, so these are the specific sections with just the lists:<br>\n<strong>Sequelize Data Types:</strong> <a href=\"https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\"><em>https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/data-types.html</em></a><br>\n<strong>Validations:</strong> <a href=\"https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html#validations\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\"><em>https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/models-definition.html#validations</em></a><br>\nWhen you access the data in your queries, here are the operators available, again because the docs are hard to navigate, this is the specific section with the list of operators.<br>\n<strong>Operators:</strong> <a href=\"https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\"><em>https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/querying.html#operators</em></a><br>\nThe documentation for building, saving, creating, updating and destroying is linked here, it does a pretty good job of explaining in my opinion, it just has a title that we have not been using in this course.
