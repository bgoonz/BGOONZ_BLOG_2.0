a closure is \"the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared\" -\n    alternatively, \"when an inner function uses or changes variables in an outer function\" -\n    closures have access to any variables within their own scope + scope of outer functions + global scope— the set of all these available variables is \"lexical environemnt\" -\n    closure keeps reference to all variables ** even\nif the outer\nfunction has returned **\n    -each\nfunction has a private mutable state that cannot be accessed externally\n    -\n    the inner\nfunction will maintain a reference to the scope in which it was declared.so it has access to variables that were initialized in any outer scope— even\nif that scope\n    -\n    if a variable exists in the scope of what could have been accessed by a\nfunction(e.g.global scope, outer\n    function, etc), does that variable wind up in the closure even\nif it never got accessed ?\n    -\n    if you change the value of a variable(e.g.i++) you will change the value of that variable in the scope that it was declared in\n\n    ``\n`javascript\nfunction createCounter() {\n   // this function starts a counter at 0, then returns a\n   // new function that can access and change that counter\n   //\n   // each new counter you create will have a single internal\n   // state, that can be changed only by calling the function.\n   // you can't access that state from outside of the function,\n   // even though the count variable in question is initialized\n   // by the outer function, and it remains accessible to the\n   // inner function after the outer function returns.\n   let count = 0;\n   return function() {\n      count ++;\n      return count;\n   }\n}\n\nlet counter = createCounter();\nconsole.log(counter()); //=> 1\nconsole.log(counter()); //=> 2\n// so the closure here comes into play because\n// an inner function is accessing and changing\n// a variable from an outer function\n\n// the closure is the combination of the counter\n// function and the all the variables that existed\n// in the scope that it was declared in. because\n// inner blocks/functions have access to outer\n// scopes, that includes the scope of the outer\n// function.\n\n// so counter variable is a closure, in that\n// it contains the inner count value that was\n// initialized by the outer createCounter() function\n// count has been captured or closed over\n\n// this state is private, so if i run createCounter again\n// i get a totally separate count that doesn't interact\n// with the previous one and each of the new functions\n// will have their own internal state based on the\n// initial declaration in the now-closed outer function\n\nlet counter2 = createCounter();\nconsole.log(counter2()); // => 1\n\n// if i set a new function equal to my existing counter\n// the internal state is shared with the new function\nlet counter3 = counter2;\nconsole.log(counter3());","position":{"start":{"line":947,"column":1,"offset":40847},"end":{"line":1073,"column":29,"offset":47821},"indent":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]}},{"type":"heading","depth":4,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Define
