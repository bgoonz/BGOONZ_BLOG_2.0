This post highlights the most common and convenient ones.</p>\n<p>Official packages for all the major platforms are available at <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>.</p>\n<p>One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package manager. In this case, every operating system has its own.</p>\n<p>On macOS, <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> is the de-facto standard, and - once installed - allows you to install Node.js very easily, by running this command in the CLI:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">brew install node\n</code></pre>\n<p>Other package managers for Linux and Windows are listed in <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\">https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/</a></p>\n<p><code>nvm</code> is a popular way to run Node.js. It allows you to easily switch the Node.js version, and install new versions to try and easily rollback if something breaks, for example.</p>\n<p>It is also very useful to test your code with old Node.js versions.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/creationix/nvm\">https://github.com/creationix/nvm</a> for more information about this option.</p>\n<p>My suggestion is to use the official installer if you are just starting out and you don't use Homebrew already, otherwise, Homebrew is my favorite solution.</p>\n<p>In any case, when Node.js is installed you'll have access to the <code>node</code> executable program in the command line.</p>"}
