The syntax is intended to be used by preprocessors (i.e., transpilers like Babel) to transform HTML-like text found in JavaScript files into standard JavaScript objects that a JavaScript engine will parse.</h6>\n<p><strong>Basically, by using JSX you can write concise HTML/XML-like structures (e.g., DOM like tree structures) in the same file as you write JavaScript code, then Babel will transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code. Unlike the past, instead of putting JavaScript into HTML, JSX allows us to put HTML into JavaScript.</strong></p>\n<p>By using JSX one can write the following JSX/JavaScript code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const nav = (\n    &#x3C;ul id=\"nav\">\n      &#x3C;li>\n&#x3C;a href=\"#\">Home&#x3C;/a>\n&#x3C;/li>\n      &#x3C;li>\n&#x3C;a href=\"#\">About&#x3C;/a>\n&#x3C;/li>\n      &#x3C;li>\n&#x3C;a href=\"#\">Clients&#x3C;/a>\n&#x3C;/li>\n      &#x3C;li>\n&#x3C;a href=\"#\">Contact Us&#x3C;/a>\n&#x3C;/li>\n    &#x3C;/ul>\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And Babel will transform it into this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const nav = React.createElement(\n   \"ul\",\n   { id: \"nav\" },\n   React.createElement(\n      \"li\",\n      null,\n      React.createElement(\n         \"a\",\n         { href: \"#\" },\n         \"Home\"\n      )\n   ),\n   React.createElement(\n      \"li\",\n      null,\n      React.createElement(\n         \"a\",\n         { href: \"#\" },\n         \"About\"\n      )\n   ),\n   React.createElement(\n      \"li\",\n      null,\n      React.createElement(\n         \"a\",\n         { href: \"#\" },\n         \"Clients\"\n      )\n   ),\n   React.createElement(\n      \"li\",\n      null,\n      React.createElement(\n         \"a\",\n         { href: \"#\" },\n         \"Contact Us\"\n      )\n   )\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can think of JSX as a shorthand for calling <code>React.createElement()</code>.</p>\n<p>The idea of mixing HTML and JavaScript in the same file can be a rather contentious topic. Ignore the debate. Use it if you find it helpful. If not, write the React code required to create React nodes. Your choice. My opinion is that JSX provides a concise and familiar syntax for defining a tree structure with attributes that does not require learning a templating language or leaving JavaScript. Both of which are can be a win when building large applications.</p>\n<p>It should be obvious but JSX is easier to read and write over large pyramids of JavaScript function calls or object literals (e.g., contrast the two code samples in this section). Additionally the React team clearly believes JSX is better suited for defining UI's than a traditional templating (e.g., Handlebars) solution:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>markup and the code that generates it are intimately tied together. Additionally, display logic is often very complex and using template languages to express it becomes cumbersome. We've found that the best solution for this problem is to generate HTML and component trees directly from the JavaScript code such that you can use all of the expressive power of a real programming language to build UIs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Consider this variable declaration:</p>\n<p>This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.</p>\n<p>It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>JSX produces React \"elements\". We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html\">next section</a>. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.</p>\n<h3>Why JSX?</h3>\n<p>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.</p>\n<p>Instead of artificially separating <em>technologies</em> by putting markup and logic in separate files, React <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">separates <em>concerns</em></a> with loosely coupled units called \"components\" that contain both. We will come back to components in a <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html\">further section</a>, but if you're not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY\">this talk</a> might convince you otherwise.</p>\n<p>React <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html\">doesn't require</a> using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, let's get started!</p>\n<h3>Embedding Expressions in JSX</h3>\n<p>In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:</p>\n<p>You can put any valid <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions\">JavaScript expression</a> inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.</p>\n<p>In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an &#x3C;h1> element.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/introducing-jsx\">Try it on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn't required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/2846283\">automatic semicolon insertion</a>.</p>\n<h3>JSX is an Expression Too</h3>\n<p>After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.</p>\n<p>This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:</p>\n<h3>Specifying Attributes with JSX</h3>\n<p>You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:</p>\n<p>You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:</p>\n<p>Don't put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, class becomes <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className\">className</a> in JSX, and tabindex becomes <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/tabIndex\">tabIndex</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Specifying Children with JSX</h3>\n<p>If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />, like XML:</p>\n<p>JSX tags may contain children:</p>\n<h3>JSX Prevents Injection Attacks</h3>\n<p>It is safe to embed user input in JSX:</p>\n<p>By default, React DOM <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html\">escapes</a> any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that's not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\">XSS (cross-site-scripting)</a> attacks.</p>\n<h3>JSX Represents Objects</h3>\n<p>Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.</p>\n<p>These two examples are identical:</p>\n<p>React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:</p>\n<p>These objects are called \"React elements\". You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.</p>\n<p>We will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html\">next section</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using the <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/editors\">\"Babel\" language definition</a> for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX code is properly highlighted.</p>\n</blockquote>"}
