Concepts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"685f\">Identify the difference between <code>const</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>var</code> declarations</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"7308\"><code>const</code> - cannot reassign variable, scoped to block</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"e07f\"><code>let</code> - can reassign variable, scoped to block</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"670d\"><code>var</code> - outdated, may or may not be reassigned, scoped to function. can be not just reassigned, but also redeclared!</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"b254\">a variable will always evaluate to the value it contains regardless of how it was declared</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"aace\">Explain the difference between <code>const</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>var</code> declarations</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"5d79\"><code>var</code> is function scoped—so if you declare it anywhere in a function, the declaration (but not assignment) is \"hoisted\"</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"a54b\">so it will exist in memory as \"undefined\" which is bad and unpredictable</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"2dc2\"><code>var</code> will also allow you to redeclare a variable, while <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> will raise a syntax error. you shouldn't be able to do that!</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"1f74\"><code>const</code> won't let you reassign a variable, but if it points to a mutable object, you will still be able to change the value by mutating the object</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"2c20\">block-scoped variables allow new variables with the same name in new scopes</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"c3d4\">block-scoped still performs hoisting of all variables within the block, but it doesn't initialize to the value of <code>undefined</code> like <code>var</code> does, so it throws a specific reference error if you try to access the value before it has been declared</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"f797\">if you do not use <code>var</code> or <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> when initializing, it will be declared as global—THIS IS BAD</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"2212\">if you assign a value without a declaration, it exists in the global scope (so then it would be accessible by all outer scopes, so bad). however, there's no hoisting, so it doesn't exist in the scope until after the line is run</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"86d1\">Predict the evaluation of code that utilizes function scope, block scope, lexical scope, and scope chaining</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"25dc\">scope of a program means the set of variables that are available for use within the program</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"bcaf\">global scope is represented by the <code>window</code> object in the browser and the <code>global</code> object in Node.js</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"7bc3\">global variables are available everywhere, and so increase the risk of name collisions</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"5172\">local scope is the set of variables available for use within the function</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"ed33\">when we enter a function, we enter a new scope</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"c21b\">includes functions arguments, local variables declared inside function, and any variables that were already declared when the function is defined (hmm about that last one)</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"51ad\">for blocks (denoted by curly braces <code>{}</code>, as in conditionals or <code>for</code> loops), variables can be block scoped</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"09f1\">inner scope does not have access to variables in the outer scope</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"587e\">scope chaining — if a given variable is not found in immediate scope, javascript will search all accessible outer scopes until variable is found</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"6ea5\">so an inner scope can access outer scope variables</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"5188\">but an outer scope can never access inner scope variables</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Define an arrow function</h4>\n<pre><code>let arrowFunction = (param1, param2) => {\n\nlet sum = param1 + param2;\n\nreturn sum;\n\n}\n\n// with 1 param you can remove parens around parameters let arrowFunction = param =>\n\n// if your return statement is one line, you can use implied return let arrowFunction = param => param + 1;\n\n// you don't have to assign to variable, can be anonymous // if you never need to use it again param => param + 1;\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Given an arrow function, deduce the value of <code>this</code> without executing the code</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"0ee6\">arrow functions are automatically bound to the context they were declared in.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"9fb2\">unlike regular function which use the context they are invoked in (unless they have been bound using <code>Function#bind</code>).</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"683a\">if you implement an arrow function as a method in an object the context it will be bound to is NOT the object itself, but the global context.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"e9e1\">so you can't use an arrow function to define a method directly</span></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- -->\n<pre><code>let obj = {\nname: \"my object\",\nunboundFunc:

function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared\" -\n    alternatively, \"when an inner function uses or changes variables in an outer function\" -\n    closures have access to any variables within their own scope + scope of outer functions + global scope— the set of all these available variables is \"lexical environemnt\" -\n    closure keeps reference to all variables ** even\nif the outer\nfunction has returned **\n    -each\nfunction has a private mutable state that cannot be accessed externally\n    -\n    the inner\nfunction will maintain a reference to the scope in which it was declared.so it has access to variables that were initialized in any outer scope— even\nif that scope\n    -\n    if a variable exists in the scope of what could have been accessed by a\nfunction(e.g.global scope, outer\n    function, etc), does that variable wind up in the closure even\nif it never got accessed ?\n    -\n    if you change the value of a variable(e.g.i++) you will change the value of that variable in the scope that it was declared in\n\n    ``\n`javascript\nfunction createCounter() {\n   // this function starts a counter at 0, then returns a\n   // new function that can access and change that counter\n   //\n   // each new counter you create will have a single internal\n   // state, that can be changed only by calling the function.\n   // you can't access that state from outside of the function,\n   // even though the count variable in question is initialized\n   // by the outer function, and it remains accessible to the\n   // inner function after the outer function returns.\n   let count = 0;\n   return function() {\n      count ++;\n      return count;\n   }\n}\n\nlet counter = createCounter();\nconsole.log(counter()); //=> 1\nconsole.log(counter()); //=> 2\n// so the closure here comes into play because\n// an inner function is accessing and changing\n// a variable from an outer function\n\n// the closure is the combination of the counter\n// function and the all the variables that existed\n// in the scope that it was declared in. because\n// inner blocks/functions have access to outer\n// scopes, that includes the scope of the outer\n// function.\n\n// so counter variable is a closure, in that\n// it contains the inner count value that was\n// initialized by the outer createCounter() function\n// count has been captured or closed over\n\n// this state is private, so if i run createCounter again\n// i get a totally separate count that doesn't interact\n// with the previous one and each of the new functions\n// will have their own internal state based on the\n// initial declaration in the now-closed outer function\n\nlet counter2 =
