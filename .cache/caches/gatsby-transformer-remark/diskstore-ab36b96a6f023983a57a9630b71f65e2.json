If you're typing this often, you can <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/introduction-to-npm-scripts-1dbb2ae01633\">create an npm script</a> to give this command a name.</p>\n<h2>How to Minify Your Minify your HTML, CSS and JavaScript Using an Online Tool\n\n</h2>\n<p>Many of these online tools have a similar process which involve the following steps:</p>\n<p>Paste in your source code or upload the source code file.\nOptimize the settings for a specific output (if options are available)\nClick a button to minify or compress the code.\nCopy the minified code output or download the minified code file.</p>\n<p>For this example, I'm going to use the minify tools from minifycode.com.</p>\n<p>First, locate the css file (commonly named style.css) in your site files and open the file using a page editor. Then copy the entire css code to your clipboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/min4.png\"></p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://minifycode.com/css-minifier/\">minifycode.com</a> and click the CSS minifier tab. Then paste the CSS code into the input box and click the Minify CSS button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/min5.png\"></p>\n<p>After the new minified code is generated, copy the code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/min6.png\"></p>\n<p>Then go back to the css file of your website and replace the code with the new minified version.</p>\n<p>That's it!</p>\n<p>Repeat the same process to minify your site's JavaScript and Html file(s) as well.</p>\n<h3>Overview\n\n</h3>\n<p>Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser - e.g. code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable and function names, and so on.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/optimize-encoding-and-transfer#minification-preprocessing--context-specific-optimizations\">preprocessing &#x26; context-specific optimizations</a> to learn more.</p>\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n<p>You should minify your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To minify HTML, try <a href=\"https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier\">HTMLMinifier</a></li>\n<li>-</li>\n<li>To minify CSS, try <a href=\"https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano\">CSSNano</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/css/csso\">csso</a>.</li>\n<li>To minify JavaScript, try <a href=\"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2\">UglifyJS</a>. The <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler\">Closure Compiler</a> is also <a href=\"https://github.com/samccone/The-cost-of-transpiling-es2015-in-2016#summary-of-findings\">very effective</a>. You can create a build process that uses these tools to minify and rename the development files and save them to a production directory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively, the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module\">PageSpeed Module</a>, integrates with an Apache or Nginx web server to automatically optimize your site, including resource minification.</p>"}
