They only connote the algorithm's performance for a particular scenario, and all three can be used for any scenario.</li>\n<li>Worst Case means given an unideal input, Average Case means given a typical input, Best case means a ideal input. Ex. Worst case means given an input the algorithm performs particularly bad, or best case an already sorted array for a sorting algorithm.</li>\n<li>Best Case and Big Omega are generally not helpful since Best Cases are rare in the real world and lower bound might be very different than an upper bound.</li>\n<li>Big-O isn't everything.

WAI-ARIA's semantic markup coupled with JavaScript works to provide an understandable and interactive experience for people who use AT.\nAn example using ARIA:</p>\n<div\n      role=\"combobox\"\n      aria-expanded=\"false\"\n      aria-owns=\"ex1-grid\"\n      aria-haspopup=\"grid\"\n      id=\"ex1-combobox\">\n...\n</div>\nCredit: W3C's [ARIA 1.1 Combobox with Grid Popup Example](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/combobox/aria1.1pattern/grid-combo.html)\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Accessible Rich Internet Applications</li>\n<li>Benefits people who use assistive technologies (AT)</li>\n<li>Provides role, name, and state</li>\n<li>Semantic HTML coupled with JavaScript</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/\">WAI-ARIA Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/\">WAI-ARIA Spec</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4bH57rWPnYo\">ARIA Serious?

It's an abstraction on top of the Promise API that makes asynchronous operations <em>look</em> like they're synchronous.\n<code>async</code> functions automatically return a Promise object. Whatever you <code>return</code> from the <code>async</code> function will be the promise's <em>resolution</em>. If instead you <code>throw</code> from the body of an <code>async</code> function, that will be how your async function <em>rejects</em> the promise it returns.\nMost importantly, <code>async</code> functions are able to use the <code>await</code> keyword in their function body, which <strong>pauses the function</strong> until the operation after the <code>await</code> completes, and allows it to return that operation's result to a variable synchronously.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Normal promises in regular function:\nfunction foo() {\n    promiseCall().then((result) => {\n        // do something with the result\n    });\n}\n// async functions\nasync function foo() {\n    const result = await promiseCall();\n    // do something with the result\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>async</code> functions are just syntactic sugar on top of Promises.</li>\n<li>They make asynchronous operations look like synchronous operations in your function.</li>\n<li>They implicitly return a promise which resolves to whatever your <code>async</code> function returns, and reject to whatever your <code>async</code> function <code>throw</code>s.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function\">MDN Docs - async function</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await\">MDN Docs - await</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Create a function <code>batches</code> that returns the maximum number of whole batches that can be cooked from a recipe.</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">/**\nIt accepts two objects as arguments: the first object is the recipe\nfor the food, while the second object is the available ingredients.\nEach ingredient's value is a number representing how many units there are.\n`batches(recipe, available)`\n*/\n// 0 batches can be made\nbatches({ milk: 100, butter: 50, flour: 5 }, { milk: 132, butter: 48, flour: 51 });\nbatches({ milk: 100, flour: 4, sugar: 10, butter: 5 }, { milk: 1288, flour: 9, sugar: 95 });\n// 1 batch can be made\nbatches({ milk: 100, butter: 50, cheese: 10 }, { milk: 198, butter: 52, cheese: 10 });\n// 2 batches can be made\nbatches({ milk: 2, sugar: 40, butter: 20 }, { milk: 5, sugar: 120, butter: 500 });\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>We must have all ingredients of the recipe available, and in quantities that are more than or equal to the number of units required.

If one of the ingredients required by the recipe is not available at all, the ratio will evaluate to <code>NaN</code>, so the logical OR operator can be used to fallback to <code>0</code> in this case.\nUse the spread <code>...</code> operator to feed the array of all the ingredient ratios into <code>Math.min()</code> to determine the lowest ratio.

BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a \"namespace\" for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-{.sourceCode\" data-meta=\".css}\">/* block component */\n.block {\n}\n/* element */\n.block__element {\n}\n/* modifier */\n.block__element--modifier {\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is an example with the class names on markup:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-{.sourceCode\" data-meta=\".html}\">&#x3C;nav class=\"navbar\">\n  &#x3C;a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link navbar__link--active\">\n&#x3C;/a>\n  &#x3C;a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\">\n&#x3C;/a>\n  &#x3C;a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\">\n&#x3C;/a>\n&#x3C;/nav>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, <code>navbar</code> is the Block, <code>navbar__link</code> is an Element that makes no sense outside of the <code>navbar</code> component, and <code>navbar__link--active</code> is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the <code>navbar__link</code> Element.\nSince Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use <code>is-*</code> flags instead as modifiers.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-{.sourceCode\" data-meta=\".html}\">&#x3C;a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link is-active\">\n&#x3C;/a>\n</code></pre>\n<p>These must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-{.sourceCode\" data-meta=\".css}\">.navbar__link.is-active {\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Alternative solutions to scope issues like CSS-in-JS</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/writing-clean-and-maintainable-css-using-bem-methodology-1dcbf810a664\">Writing clean and maintainable CSS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is Big O Notation?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. The best algorithms will execute the fastest and have the simplest complexity.\nAlgorithms don't always perform the same and may vary based on the data they are supplied.

The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.\nHowever, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user's cache still references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.\nCache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old file.\nA common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the file.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>src=\"js/script.js\"</code> => <code>src=\"js/script.js?v=2\"</code>\nThe browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/strategies-for-cache-busting-css/\">Strategies for cache-busting CSS</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> How can you avoid callback hells?</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">getData(function (a) {\n    getMoreData(a, function (b) {\n        getMoreData(b, function (c) {\n            getMoreData(c, function (d) {\n                getMoreData(d, function (e) {\n                    // ...\n                });\n            });\n        });\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Refactoring the functions to return promises and using <code>async/await</code> is usually the best option. Instead of supplying the functions with callbacks that cause deep nesting, they return a promise that can be <code>await</code>ed and will be resolved once the data has arrived, allowing the next line of code to be evaluated in a sync-like fashion.\nThe above code can be restructured like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function asyncAwaitVersion() {\n    const a = await getData();\n    const b = await getMoreData(a);\n    const c = await getMoreData(b);\n    const d = await getMoreData(c);\n    const e = await getMoreData(d);\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modularization: break callbacks into independent functions</li>\n<li>Use a control flow library, like async</li>\n<li>Use generators with Promises</li>\n<li>Use async/await (from v7 on)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>As an efficient JavaScript developer, you have to avoid the constantly growing indentation level, produce clean and readable code and be able to handle complex flows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackabuse.com/avoiding-callback-hell-in-node-js/\">Avoiding Callback Hell in Node.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.hellojs.org/asynchronous-javascript-from-callback-hell-to-async-and-await-9b9ceb63c8e8\">Asynchronous JavaScript: From Callback Hell to Async and Await</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of <code>setState</code>?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>The callback function is invoked when <code>setState</code> has finished and the component gets rendered.

A simple usage example of the children prop is as follows:</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function GenericBox({ children }) {\n    return &#x3C;div className=\"container\">{children}&#x3C;/div>;\n}\nfunction App() {\n    return (\n        &#x3C;GenericBox>\n            &#x3C;span>Hello&#x3C;/span> &#x3C;span>World&#x3C;/span>\n        &#x3C;/GenericBox>\n    );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Children is a prop that allows components to be passed as data to other components.</li>\n<li>The React API provides methods to work with this prop.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#children-in-jsx\">React docs on Children</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Why does React use <code>className</code> instead of <code>class</code> like in HTML?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>React's philosophy in the beginning was to align with the browser DOM API rather than HTML, since that more closely represents how elements are created. Setting a <code>class</code> on an element meant using the <code>className</code> API:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const element = document.createElement('div');\nelement.className = 'hello';\n</code></pre>\n<p>Additionally, before ES5, reserved words could not be used in objects:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const element = {\n    attributes: {\n        class: 'hello'\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In IE8, this will throw an error.\nIn modern environments, destructuring will throw an error if trying to assign to a variable:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const { class } = this.props // Error\nconst { className } = this.props // All good\nconst { class: className } =\n    this.props // All good, but\n        cumbersome!\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, <code>class</code> <em>can</em> be used as a prop without problems, as seen in other libraries like Preact. React currently allows you to use <code>class</code>, but will throw a warning and convert it to <code>className</code> under the hood. There is currently an open thread (as of January 2019) discussing changing <code>className</code> to <code>class</code> to reduce confusion.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> How do you clone an object in JavaScript?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Using the object spread operator <code>...</code>, the object's own enumerable properties can be copied into the new object.

Can you give a useful example of one?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>A closure is a function defined inside another function and has access to its lexical scope even when it is executing outside its lexical scope. The closure has access to variables in three scopes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variables declared in its own scope</li>\n<li>Variables declared in the scope of the parent function</li>\n<li>Variables declared in the global scope\nIn JavaScript, all functions are closures because they have access to the outer scope, but most functions don't utilise the usefulness of closures: the persistence of state. Closures are also sometimes called stateful functions because of this.\nIn addition, closures are the only way to store private data that can't be accessed from the outside in JavaScript. They are the key to the UMD (Universal Module Definition) pattern, which is frequently used in libraries that only expose a public API but keep the implementation details private, preventing name collisions with other libraries or the user's own code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Closures are useful because they let you associate data with a function that operates on that data.</li>\n<li>A closure can substitute an object with only a single method.</li>\n<li>Closures can be used to emulate private properties and methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures\">MDN docs for closures</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-closure-b2f0d2152b36\">What is a closure</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/dailyjs/i-never-understood-javascript-closures-9663703368e8\">I never understood JavaScript closures</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> How do you compare two objects in JavaScript?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Even though two different objects can have the same properties with equal values, they are not considered equal when compared using <code>==</code> or <code>===</code>. This is because they are being compared by their reference (location in memory), unlike primitive values which are compared by value.\nIn order to test if two objects are equal in structure, a helper function is required. It will iterate through the own properties of each object to test if they have the same values, including nested objects. Optionally, the prototypes of the objects may also be tested for equivalence by passing <code>true</code> as the 3rd argument.\nNote: this technique does not attempt to test equivalence of data structures other than plain objects, arrays, functions, dates and primitive values.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function isDeepEqual(obj1, obj2, testPrototypes = false) {\n    if (obj1 === obj2) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if (typeof obj1 === 'function' &#x26;&#x26; typeof obj2 === 'function') {\n        return obj1.toString() === obj2.toString();\n    }\n    if (obj1 instanceof Date &#x26;&#x26; obj2 instanceof Date) {\n        return obj1.getTime() === obj2.getTime();\n    }\n    if (Object.prototype.toString.call(obj1) !== Object.prototype.toString.call(obj2) || typeof obj1 !== 'object') {\n        return false;\n    }\n    const prototypesAreEqual = testPrototypes ? isDeepEqual(Object.getPrototypeOf(obj1), Object.getPrototypeOf(obj2), true) : true;\n    const obj1Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj1);\n    const obj2Props = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj2);\n    return obj1Props.length === obj2Props.length &#x26;&#x26; prototypesAreEqual &#x26;&#x26; obj1Props.every((prop) => isDeepEqual(obj1[prop], obj2[prop]));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Primitives like strings and numbers are compared by their value</li>\n<li>Objects on the other hand are compared by their reference (location in memory)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/object-equality-in-javascript.html\">Object Equality in JavaScript</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://30secondsofcode.org/object#equals\">Deep comparison between two values</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is context?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Can you show an example of how to use it?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Event delegation is a technique of delegating events to a single common ancestor. Due to event bubbling, events \"bubble\" up the DOM tree by executing any handlers progressively on each ancestor element up to the root that may be listening to it.\nDOM events provide useful information about the element that initiated the event via <code>Event.target</code>. This allows the parent element to handle behavior as though the target element was listening to the event, rather than all children of the parent or the parent itself.\nThis provides two main benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It increases performance and reduces memory consumption by only needing to register a single event listener to handle potentially thousands of elements.</li>\n<li>If elements are dynamically added to the parent, there is no need to register new event listeners for them.\nInstead of:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">document.querySelectorAll('button').forEach((button) => {\n    button.addEventListener('click', handleButtonClick);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Event delegation involves using a condition to ensure the child target matches our desired element:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {\n    if (e.target.closest('button')) {\n        handleButtonClick();\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference between event bubbling and capturing</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate\">Event Delegation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is event-driven programming?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Event-driven programming is a paradigm that involves building applications that send and receive events. When the program emits events, the program responds by running any callback functions that are registered to that event and context, passing in associated data to the function. With this pattern, events can be emitted into the wild without throwing errors even if no functions are subscribed to it.\nA common example of this is the pattern of elements listening to DOM events such as <code>click</code> and <code>mouseenter</code>, where a callback function is run when the event occurs.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">document.addEventListener('click', function (event) {\n    // This callback function is run when the user\n    // clicks on the document.\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Without the context of the DOM, the pattern may look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const hub = createEventHub();\nhub.on('message', function (data) {\n    console.log(`${data.username} said ${data.text}`);\n});\nhub.emit('message', {\n    username: 'John',\n    text: 'Hello?'\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this implementation, <code>on</code> is the way to <em>subscribe</em> to an event, while <code>emit</code> is the way to <em>publish</em> the event.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Follows a publish-subscribe pattern.</li>\n<li>Responds to events that occur by running any callback functions subscribed to the event.</li>\n<li>Show how to create a simple pub-sub implementation with JavaScript.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Overview_of_Events_and_Handlers\">MDN docs on Events and Handlers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-node-js-event-driven-architecture-223292fcbc2d\">Understanding Node.js event-driven architecture</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is the difference between an expression and a statement in JavaScript?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>There are two main syntactic categories in JavaScript: expressions and statements. A third one is both together, referred to as an expression statement. They are roughly summarized as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Expression</strong>: produces a value</li>\n<li><strong>Statement</strong>: performs an action</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Expression statement</strong>: produces a value and performs an action\nA general rule of thumb:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you can print it or assign it to a variable, it's an expression.

A value is not produced by other parts of the code.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Expressions</h3>\n<p>Expressions produce a value. They can be passed around to functions because the interpreter replaces them with the value they resolve to.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">5 + 5; // => 10\nlastCharacter('input'); // => \"t\"\ntrue === true; // => true\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Expression statements</h3>\n<p>There is an equivalent version of the set of statements used before as an expression using the conditional operator:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Assign `x` as the absolute value of `y`.\nvar x = y >= 0 ? y : -y;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is both an expression and a statement, because we are declaring a variable <code>x</code> (statement) as an evaluation (expression).</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Function declarations vs function expressions</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12703214/javascript-difference-between-a-statement-and-an-expression\">What is the difference between a statement and an expression?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What are truthy and falsy values in JavaScript?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>A value is either truthy or falsy depending on how it is evaluated in a Boolean context. Falsy means false-like and truthy means true-like. Essentially, they are values that are coerced to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> when performing certain operations.\nThere are 6 falsy values in JavaScript. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>false</code></li>\n<li><code>undefined</code></li>\n<li><code>null</code></li>\n<li><code>\"\"</code> (empty string)</li>\n<li><code>NaN</code></li>\n<li><code>0</code> (both <code>+0</code> and <code>-0</code>)\nEvery other value is considered truthy.\nA value's truthiness can be examined by passing it into the <code>Boolean</code> function.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">Boolean(''); // false\nBoolean([]); // true\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is a shortcut for this using the logical NOT <code>!</code> operator. Using <code>!</code> once will convert a value to its inverse boolean equivalent (i.e. not false is true), and <code>!</code> once more will convert back, thus effectively converting the value to a boolean.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">!!''; // false\n!![]; // true\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Glossary/Truthy\">Truthy on MDN</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy\">Falsy on MDN</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Generate an array, containing the Fibonacci sequence, up until the nth term.</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Initialize an empty array of length <code>n</code>.

What is the correct solution to handle them?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>A focus ring is a visible outline given to focusable elements such as buttons and anchor tags. It varies depending on the vendor, but generally it appears as a blue outline around the element to indicate it is currently focused.\nIn the past, many people specified <code>outline: 0;</code> on the element to remove the focus ring. However, this causes accessibility issues for keyboard users because the focus state may not be clear. When not specified though, it causes an unappealing blue ring to appear around an element.\nIn recent times, frameworks like Bootstrap have opted to use a more appealing <code>box-shadow</code> outline to replace the default focus ring. However, this is still not ideal for mouse users.\nThe best solution is an upcoming pseudo-selector <code>:focus-visible</code> which can be polyfilled today with JavaScript. It will only show a focus ring if the user is using a keyboard and leave it hidden for mouse users. This keeps both aesthetics for mouse use and accessibility for keyboard use.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/focus-visible-and-backwards-compatibility/\">:focus-visible</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is the difference between the array methods <code>map()</code> and <code>forEach()</code>?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Both methods iterate through the elements of an array. <code>map()</code> maps each element to a new element by invoking the callback function on each element and returning a new array.

This means that 'examplesite.com' and 'examplesite.com/page2' are actually the same HTML web page, but the client app decides what content to drop into that single page at runtime. Your user never actually \"leaves\" the page, and this causes some accessibility issues in terms of focus.\nUnless focus is explicitly managed in the app, a scenario like this may happen:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>User visits 'examplesite.com'</li>\n<li>User clicks a link to go to another route: 'examplesite.com/product1'</li>\n<li>Client app changes the visible content to show the details for this new route (e.g. some info about Product 1)</li>\n<li>Focus is still on the link that was clicked in step 2</li>\n<li>If a user uses the keyboard or screen reader to now try and read the content, the focused starting point is in the middle of the page on an element no longer visible\nMany strategies have been proposed in handling this situation, all involving explicitly managing the focus when the new page content is rendered. <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/\">Recent research by GatsbyJS</a> suggests the best approach is:</li>\n<li>User visits 'examplesite.com'</li>\n<li>User clicks a link to go to another route: 'examplesite.com/product1'</li>\n<li>Client app changes the visible content to show the details for this new route (e.g. some info about Product 1)</li>\n<li>Client app manually places focus on the main header at the top of the page (almost always this will be the H1 element)\nBy doing so, focus is reset to the top of the page, ready for the user to begin exploring the new content. This solution requires inserting the main heading into the start of tabbing order with <code>tabindex=\"-1\"</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus issues caused by client-side rendering, instead of server-side</li>\n<li>Focus should not be left on elements no longer visible on the page</li>\n<li>Challenges faced by screen reader users and users utilising keyboard navigation</li>\n<li>Careful manual focus management required</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.upyoura11y.com/handling-focus/\">Handling Focus on Route Change: Up Your A11y</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What are higher-order components?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component. It is a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature. Higher-order components are like <strong>pure components</strong> because they accept any dynamically provided child component, but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>They can be used for state abstraction and manipulation, props manipulation, render high jacking, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What will the console log in this example?</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var foo = 1;\nvar foobar = function () {\n    console.log(foo);\n    var foo = 2;\n};\nfoobar();\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Due to hoisting, the local variable <code>foo</code> is declared before the <code>console.log</code> method is called.

This means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.\nHowever, the value is not hoisted with the declaration.\nThe following snippet:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">console.log(hoist);\nvar hoist = 'value';\n</code></pre>\n<p>is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var hoist;\nconsole.log(hoist);\nhoist = 'value';\n</code></pre>\n<p>Therefore logging <code>hoist</code> outputs <code>undefined</code> to the console, not <code>\"value\"</code>.\nHoisting also allows you to invoke a function declaration before it appears to be declared in a program.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">myFunction(); // No error; logs \"hello\"\nfunction myFunction() {\n    console.log('hello');\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But be wary of function expressions that are assigned to a variable:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">myFunction(); // Error: `myFunction` is not a function\nvar myFunction = function () {\n    console.log('hello');\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top</li>\n<li>Functions declarations are hoisted before variable declarations</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting\">MDN docs for hoisting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-hoisting-in-javascript\">Understanding Hoisting in JavaScript</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Can a web page contain multiple <code>&#x3C;header></code> elements?

In addition, a specification provides instructions on how a browser must interpret and render such a document.\nA browser is said to \"support\" a specification if it handles valid documents according to the rules of the specification. As of yet, no browser supports all aspects of the <code>HTML5</code> specification (although all of the major browser support most of it), and as a result, it is necessary for the developer to confirm whether the aspect they are making use of will be supported by all of the browsers on which they hope to display their content.

It creates a closure around the entire contents of the file which creates a private namespace and thereby helps avoid potential name clashes between different JavaScript modules and libraries. The function is immediately invoked so that the namespace (library name) is assigned the return value of the function.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const myLibrary = (function () {\n    var privateVariable = 2;\n    return {\n        publicMethod: () => privateVariable\n    };\n})();\nprivateVariable; // ReferenceError\nmyLibrary.publicMethod(); // 2\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Used among many popular JavaScript libraries</li>\n<li>Creates a private namespace</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures\">MDN docs for closures</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Explain the differences between imperative and declarative programming.</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>These two types of programming can roughly be summarized as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Imperative: <strong>how</strong> to achieve something</li>\n<li>Declarative: <strong>what</strong> should be achieved\nA common example of declarative programming is CSS. The developer specifies CSS properties that describe what something should look like rather than how to achieve it. The \"how\" is abstracted away by the browser.\nOn the other hand, imperative programming involves the steps required to achieve something. In JavaScript, the differences can be contrasted like so:</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Imperative</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst numbersDoubled = [];\nfor (let i = 0; i &#x3C; numbers.length; i++) {\n    numbersDoubled[i] = numbers[i] * 2;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We manually loop over the numbers of the array and assign the new index as the number doubled.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Declarative</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst numbersDoubled = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We declare that the new array is mapped to a new one where each value is doubled.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Declarative programming often works with functions and expressions. Imperative programming frequently uses statements and relies on low-level features that cause mutations, while declarative programming has a strong focus on abstraction and purity.</li>\n<li>Declarative programming is more terse and easier to process at a glance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://codeburst.io/declarative-vs-imperative-programming-a8a7c93d9ad2\">Declarative vs Imperative Programming</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What are inline conditional expressions?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Since a JSX element tree is one large expression, you cannot embed statements inside. Conditional expressions act as a replacement for statements to use inside the tree.\nFor example, this won't work:</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function App({ messages, isVisible }) {\n    return (\n        &#x3C;div>\n            if (messages.length > 0) {&#x3C;h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.&#x3C;/h2>} else {&#x3C;h2>You have no unread messages.&#x3C;/h2>}\n            if (isVisible) {&#x3C;p>I am visible.&#x3C;/p>}\n        &#x3C;/div>\n    );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Logical AND <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code> and the ternary <code>? :</code> operator replace the <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statements.</p>\n<hr>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function App({ messages, isVisible }) {\n    return (\n        &#x3C;div>\n            {messages.length > 0 ? &#x3C;h2>You have {messages.length} unread messages.&#x3C;/h2> : &#x3C;h2>You have no unread messages.&#x3C;/h2>}\n            {isVisible &#x26;&#x26; &#x3C;p>I am visible.&#x3C;/p>}\n        &#x3C;/div>\n    );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html\">React docs on Conditional Rendering</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is a key?

Used to update the state based on changes in props over time. Has rare use cases, like tracking component animations during the lifecycle. There are only few cases where this makes sense to use over other lifecycle methods. It expects to return an object that will be the the new state, or null to update nothing. This method does not have access to the component instance either.\n<code>componentDidMount</code>: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up eventListeners should occur.\n<code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default, it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return a false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a rerender if component receives new prop.\n<code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate</code>: Invoked right after a component render happens because of an update, before <code>componentDidUpdate</code>. Any value returned from this method will be passed to <code>componentDidUpdate</code>.\n<code>componentDidUpdate</code>: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.\n<code>componentWillUnmount</code>: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.\n<code>componentDidCatch</code>: Used in error boundaries, which are components that implement this method. It allows the component to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the <em>child</em> component tree (below this component), log errors, and display a UI with error information.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What are the different phases of the component lifecycle in React?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>There are four different phases of component's lifecycle:\n<strong>Initialization</strong>: In this phase, the component prepares setting up the initial state and default props.\n<strong>Mounting</strong>: The react component is ready to mount to the DOM. This phase covers the <code>getDerivedStateFromProps</code> and <code>componentDidMount</code> lifecycle methods.\n<strong>Updating</strong>: In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state. This phase covers the <code>getDerivedStateFromProps</code>, <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>, <code>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate</code> and <code>componentDidUpdate</code> lifecycle methods.\n<strong>Unmounting</strong>: In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes the <code>componentWillUnmount</code> lifecycle method.\n<strong>Error Handling</strong>: In this phase, the component is called whenever there's an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor for any child component. This phase includes the <code>componentDidCatch</code> lifecycle method.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What does lifting state up in React mean?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>When several components need to share the same data, then it is recommended to lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.

Calling the function again with the same input will return the cached output without needing to do the calculation again.\nA basic implementation in JavaScript looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const memoize = (fn) => {\n    const cache = new Map();\n    return (value) => {\n        const cachedResult = cache.get(value);\n        if (cachedResult !== undefined) return cachedResult;\n        const result = fn(value);\n        cache.set(value, result);\n        return result;\n    };\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The above technique returns a unary function even if the function can take multiple arguments.</li>\n<li>The first function call will be slower than usual because of the overhead created by checking if a cached result exists and setting a result before returning the value.</li>\n<li>Memoization increases performance on subsequent function calls but still needs to do work on the first call.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/implementing-memoization-in-javascript/\">Implementing memoization in JavaScript</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> How do you ensure methods have the correct <code>this</code> context in React component classes?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. This means that their <code>this</code> context can be changed (in the case of an event handler, to the element that is listening to the event) and will not refer to the component instance. To solve this, <code>Function.prototype.bind()</code> can be used to enforce the <code>this</code> context as the component instance.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">constructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\n}\nhandleClick() {\n  // Perform some logic\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>bind</code> approach can be verbose and requires defining a <code>constructor</code>, so the new public class fields syntax is generally preferred:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">handleClick = () => {\n  console.log('this is:', this);\n}\nrender() {\n  return (\n    &#x3C;button onClick={this.handleClick}>\n      Click me\n    &#x3C;/button>\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>You can also use an inline arrow function, because lexical <code>this</code> (referring to the component instance) is preserved:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">&#x3C;button onClick={(e) => this.handleClick(e)}>Click me&#x3C;/button>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that extra re-rendering can occur using this technique because a new function reference is created on render, which gets passed down to child components and breaks <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> / <code>PureComponent</code> shallow equality checks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. In cases where performance is important, it is preferred to go with <code>bind</code> in the constructor, or the public class fields syntax approach, because the function reference remains constant.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can either bind methods to the component instance context in the constructor, use public class fields syntax, or use inline arrow functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html\">React docs on Handling Events</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-functions.html#how-do-i-bind-a-function-to-a-component-instance\">React docs on Passing Functions to Components</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is a MIME type and what is it used for?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p><code>MIME</code> is an acronym for <code>Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions</code>.

This means operations performed on objects can change the original reference in some way, while operations performed on a primitive value cannot change the original value.\nAll <code>String.prototype</code> methods do not have an effect on the original string and return a new string. On the other hand, while some methods of <code>Array.prototype</code> do not mutate the original array reference and produce a fresh array, some cause mutations.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const myString = 'hello!';\nmyString.replace('!', ''); // returns a new string, cannot mutate the original value\nconst originalArray = [1, 2, 3];\noriginalArray.push(4); // mutates originalArray, now [1, 2, 3, 4]\noriginalArray.concat(4); // returns a new array, does not mutate the original\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>List of mutating and non-mutating array methods</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lorenstewart.me/2017/01/22/javascript-array-methods-mutating-vs-non-mutating/\">Mutating vs non-mutating array methods</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is the only value not equal to itself in JavaScript?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p><code>NaN</code> (Not-a-Number) is the only value not equal to itself when comparing with any of the comparison operators. <code>NaN</code> is often the result of meaningless math computations, so two <code>NaN</code> values make no sense to be considered equal.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The difference between <code>isNaN()</code> and <code>Number.isNaN()</code></li>\n<li><code>const isNaN = x => x !== x</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN\">MDN docs for <code>NaN</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> NodeJS often uses a callback pattern where if an error is encountered during execution, this error is passed as the first argument to the callback.

In JavaScript, recursion involves functions that call themselves repeatedly until they reach a base condition. The base condition breaks out of the recursion loop because otherwise the function would call itself indefinitely. Recursion is very useful when working with data structures that contain nesting where the number of levels deep is unknown.\nFor example, you may have a thread of comments returned from a database that exist in a flat array but need to be nested for display in the UI. Each comment is either a top-level comment (no parent) or is a reply to a parent comment. Comments can be a reply of a reply of a reply… we have no knowledge beforehand the number of levels deep a comment may be. This is where recursion can help.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const nest = (items, id = null, link = 'parent_id') => items.filter((item) => item[link] === id).map((item) => ({ ...item, children: nest(items, item.id) }));\nconst comments = [\n    { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: 'First reply to post.' },\n    { id: 2, parent_id: 1, text: 'First reply to comment #1.' },\n    { id: 3, parent_id: 1, text: 'Second reply to comment #1.' },\n    { id: 4, parent_id: 3, text: 'First reply to comment #3.' },\n    { id: 5, parent_id: 4, text: 'First reply to comment #4.' },\n    { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: 'Second reply to post.' }\n];\nnest(comments);\n/*\n[\n  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: \"First reply to post.\", children: [...] },\n  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: \"Second reply to post.\", children: [] }\n]\n*/\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above example, the base condition is met if <code>filter()</code> returns an empty array. The chained <code>map()</code> won't invoke the callback function which contains the recursive call, thereby breaking the loop.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Recursion is useful when working with data structures containing an unknown number of nested structures.</li>\n<li>Recursion must have a base condition to be met that breaks out of the loop or it will call itself indefinitely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/25052/in-plain-english-what-is-recursion\">In plain English, what is recursion?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is the output of the following code?</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const a = [1, 2, 3];\nconst b = [1, 2, 3];\nconst c = '1,2,3';\nconsole.log(a == c);\nconsole.log(a == b);\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>The first <code>console.log</code> outputs <code>true</code> because JavaScript's compiler performs type conversion and therefore it compares to strings by their value.

JavaScript?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Sometimes. Due to JavaScript's automatic semicolon insertion, the interpreter places semicolons after most statements. This means semicolons can be omitted in most cases.\nHowever, there are some cases where they are required. They are not required at the beginning of a block, but are if they follow a line and:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The line starts with <code>[</code></li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const previousLine = 3;\n[1, 2, previousLine].map((n) => n * 2);\n</code></pre>\n<ol>\n<li>The line starts with <code>(</code></li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const previousLine = 3;\n(function () {\n    // ...\n})();\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above cases, the interpreter does not insert a semicolon after <code>3</code>, and therefore it will see the <code>3</code> as attempting object property access or being invoked as a function, which will throw errors.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Semicolons are usually optional in JavaScript but have edge cases where they are required.</li>\n<li>If you don't use semicolons, tools like Prettier will insert semicolons for you in the places where they are required on save in a text editor to prevent errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is short-circuit evaluation in JavaScript?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Short-circuit evaluation involves logical operations evaluating from left-to-right and stopping early.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">true || false;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above sample using logical OR, JavaScript won't look at the second operand <code>false</code>, because the expression evaluates to <code>true</code> regardless. This is known as short-circuit evaluation.\nThis also works for logical AND.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">false &#x26;&#x26; true;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This means you can have an expression that throws an error if evaluated, and it won't cause issues.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">true || nonexistentFunction();\nfalse &#x26;&#x26; nonexistentFunction();\n</code></pre>\n<p>This remains true for multiple operations because of left-to-right evaluation.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">true || nonexistentFunction() || window.nothing.wouldThrowError;\ntrue || window.nothing.wouldThrowError;\ntrue;\n</code></pre>\n<p>A common use case for this behavior is setting default values. If the first operand is falsy the second operand will be evaluated.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const options = {};\nconst setting = options.setting || 'default';\nsetting; // \"default\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another common use case is only evaluating an expression if the first operand is truthy.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Instead of:\naddEventListener('click', (e) => {\n    if (e.target.closest('button')) {\n        handleButtonClick(e);\n    }\n});\n// You can take advantage of short-circuit evaluation:\naddEventListener('click', (e) => e.target.closest('button') &#x26;&#x26; handleButtonClick(e));\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the above case, if <code>e.target</code> is not or does not contain an element matching the <code>\"button\"</code> selector, the function will not be called. This is because the first operand will be falsy, causing the second operand to not be evaluated.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Logical operations do not produce a boolean unless the operand(s) evaluate to a boolean.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-is-short-circuit-evaluation-ff22b2f5608c\">JavaScript: What is short-circuit evaluation?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What are the advantages of using CSS sprites and how are they utilized?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>CSS sprites combine multiple images into one image, limiting the number of HTTP requests a browser has to make, thus improving load times. Even under the new HTTP/2 protocol, this remains true.\nUnder HTTP/1.1, at most one request is allowed per TCP connection. With HTTP/1.1, modern browsers open multiple parallel connections (between 2 to 8) but it is limited. With HTTP/2, all requests between the browser and the server are multiplexed on a single TCP connection. This means the cost of opening and closing multiple connections is mitigated, resulting in a better usage of the TCP connection and limits the impact of latency between the client and server. It could then become possible to load tens of images in parallel on the same TCP connection.\nHowever, according to <a href=\"https://blog.octo.com/en/http2-arrives-but-sprite-sets-aint-no-dead/\">benchmark results</a>, although HTTP/2 offers 50% improvement over HTTP/1.1, in most cases the sprite set is still faster to load than individual images.\nTo utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as <code>background-image</code>, <code>background-position</code> and <code>background-size</code> to ultimately alter the <code>background</code> of an element.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>background-image</code>, <code>background-position</code> and <code>background-size</code> can be used to utilize a spritesheet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/\">CSS Sprites explained by CSS Tricks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is a stateful component in React?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>A stateful component is a component whose behavior depends on its state. This means that two separate instances of the component if given the same props will not necessarily render the same output, unlike pure function components.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// Stateful class component\nclass App extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        this.state = { count: 0 };\n    }\n    render() {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n// Stateful function component\nfunction App() {\n    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n    return; // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stateful components have internal state that they depend on.</li>\n<li>Stateful components are class components or function components that use stateful Hooks.</li>\n<li>Stateful components have their state initialized in the constructor or with <code>useState()</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html\">React docs on State and Lifecycle</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is a stateless component?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>A stateless component is a component whose behavior does not depend on its state. Stateless components can be either functional or class components. Stateless functional components are easier to maintain and test since they are guaranteed to produce the same output given the same props. Stateless functional components should be preferred when lifecycle hooks don't need to be used.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stateless components are independent of their state.</li>\n<li>Stateless components can be either class or functional components.</li>\n<li>Stateless functional components avoid the <code>this</code> keyword altogether.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html\">React docs on State and Lifecycle</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Explain the difference between a static method and an instance method.</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Static methods belong to a class and don't act on instances, while instance methods belong to the class prototype which is inherited by all instances of the class and acts on them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">Array.isArray; // static method of Array\nArray.prototype.push; // instance method of Array\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, the <code>Array.isArray</code> method does not make sense as an instance method of arrays because we already know the value is an array when working with it.\nInstance methods could technically work as static methods, but provide terser syntax:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const arr = [1, 2, 3];\narr.push(4);\nArray.push(arr, 4);\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>How to create static and instance methods with ES2015 class syntax</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes\">Classes on MDN</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?</h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Answer</h3>\n<p>Synchronous means each operation must wait for the previous one to complete.\nAsynchronous means an operation can occur while another operation is still being processed.\nIn JavaScript, all code is synchronous due to the single-threaded nature of it.

Additionally, they provide the ability to create components that can be reused when they have similar functionality with minor differences, avoiding duplication which would require multiple changes whenever the structure of a component which is reused in multiple places needs to be updated.\nWhen working with DOM manipulation libraries like jQuery, the data of an application is generally kept in the DOM itself, often as class names or <code>data</code> attributes. Manipulating the DOM to update the UI involves many extra steps and can introduce subtle bugs over time. Keeping the state separate and letting a framework handle the UI updates when the state changes reduces cognitive load. Saying you want the UI to look a certain way when the state is a certain value is the declarative way of creating an application, instead of the imperative way of manually updating the UI to reflect the new state.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The virtual DOM is a representation of the real DOM tree in the form of plain objects, which allows a library to write code as if the entire document is thrown away and rebuilt on each change, while the real DOM only updates what needs to be changed.

In non-strict mode, if the variable has not yet been declared, it will assign the variable as a property of the global object (<code>window</code> in browsers). In strict mode, it will throw an error to prevent unwanted global variables from being created.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> var</h3>\n<p><code>var</code> was the default statement to declare a variable until ES2015. It creates a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned and redeclared. However, due to its lack of block scoping, it can cause issues if the variable is being reused in a loop that contains an asynchronous callback because the variable will continue to exist outside of the block scope.\nBelow, by the time the the <code>setTimeout</code> callback executes, the loop has already finished and the <code>i</code> variable is <code>10</code>, so all ten callbacks reference the same variable available in the function scope.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">for (var i = 0; i &#x3C; 10; i++) {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n        // logs `10` ten times\n        console.log(i);\n    });\n}\n/* Solutions with `var` */\nfor (var i = 0; i &#x3C; 10; i++) {\n    // Passed as an argument will use the value as-is in\n    // that point in time\n    setTimeout(console.log, 0, i);\n}\nfor (var i = 0; i &#x3C; 10; i++) {\n    // Create a new function scope that will use the value\n    // as-is in that point in time\n    ((i) => {\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            console.log(i);\n        });\n    })(i);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> let</h3>\n<p><code>let</code> was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred way to declare variables that will be reassigned later. Trying to redeclare a variable again will throw an error. It is block-scoped so that using it in a loop will keep it scoped to the iteration.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; 10; i++) {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n        // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n        console.log(i);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> const</h3>\n<p><code>const</code> was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred default way to declare all variables if they won't be reassigned later, even for objects that will be mutated (as long as the reference to the object does not change). It is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const myObject = {};\nmyObject.prop = 'hello!'; // No error\nmyObject = 'hello'; // Error\n</code></pre>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope.</li>\n<li>However, with <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> there is a concept called the temporal dead zone (TDZ).

When the state of an application changes, the real DOM needs to be updated to reflect it. However, changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating the virtual DOM. The previous virtual DOM can be compared to the new virtual DOM very quickly in comparison.\nOnce the changes between the old VDOM and new VDOM have been calculated by the diffing engine of the framework, the real DOM can be patched efficiently in the least time possible to match the new state of the application.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Don't forget:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Why accessing the DOM can be so costly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> Additional links</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://reactkungfu.com/2015/10/the-difference-between-virtual-dom-and-dom/\">The difference between Virtual DOM and DOM</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"color:red;\"> What is WCAG?

This is often achieved when the application does not validate user input and freely injects dynamic HTML content.\nFor example, a comment system will be at risk if it does not validate or escape user input.
