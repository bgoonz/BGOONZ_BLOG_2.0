In fact, as of November 1997, only one of the top four commercial search engines finds itself (returns its own search page in response to its name in the top ten results). One of the main causes of this problem is that the number of documents in the indices has been increasing by many orders of magnitude, but the user's ability to look at documents has not. People are still only willing to look at the first few tens of results. Because of this, as the collection size grows, we need tools that have very high precision (number of relevant documents returned, say in the top tens of results). Indeed, we want our notion of \"relevant\" to only include the very best documents since there may be tens of thousands of slightly relevant documents. This very high precision is important even at the expense of recall (the total number of relevant documents the system is able to return).

The \"Very Large Corpus\" benchmark is only 20GB compared to the 147GB from our crawl of 24 million web pages. Things that work well on TREC often do not produce good results on the web. For example, the standard vector space model tries to return the document that most closely approximates the query, given that both query and document are vectors defined by their word occurrence. On the web, this strategy often returns very short documents that are the query plus a few words. For example, we have seen a major search engine return a page containing only \"Bill Clinton Sucks\" and picture from a \"Bill Clinton\" query. Some argue that on the web, users should specify more accurately what they want and add more words to their query. We disagree vehemently with this position. If a user issues a query like \"Bill Clinton\" they should get reasonable results since there is a enormous amount of high quality information available on this topic.

Google considers each hit to be one of several different types (title, anchor, URL, plain text large font, plain text small font, ...), each of which has its own type-weight.

This way information can be kept up to date and major changes to the system can be tested relatively quickly. For Google, the major operations are Crawling, Indexing, and Sorting. It is difficult to measure how long crawling took overall because disks filled up, name servers crashed, or any number of other problems which stopped the system. In total it took roughly 9 days to download the 26 million pages (including errors). However, once the system was running smoothly, it ran much faster, downloading the last 11 million pages in just 63 hours, averaging just over 4 million pages per day or 48.5 pages per second. We ran the indexer and the crawler simultaneously. The indexer ran just faster than the crawlers. This is largely because we spent just enough time optimizing the indexer so that it would not be a bottleneck. These optimizations included bulk updates to the document index and placement of critical data structures on the local disk. The indexer runs at roughly 54 pages per second. The sorters can be run completely in parallel; using four machines, the whole process of sorting takes about 24 hours.","position":{"start":{"line":298,"column":1,"offset":46422},"end":{"line":298,"column":1191,"offset":47612},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":298,"column":1,"offset":46422},"end":{"line":298,"column":1191,"offset":47612},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":3,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"5.3 Search Performance","position":{"start":{"line":300,"column":5,"offset":47618},"end":{"line":300,"column":27,"offset":47640},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":300,"column":1,"offset":47614},"end":{"line":300,"column":27,"offset":47640},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Improving the performance of search was not the major focus of our research up to this point.

We also plan to support user context (like the user's location), and result summarization. We are also working to extend the use of link structure and link text. Simple experiments indicate PageRank can be personalized by increasing the weight of a user's home page or bookmarks. As for link text, we are experimenting with using text surrounding links in addition to the link text itself. A Web search engine is a very rich environment for research ideas.

The analysis of link structure via PageRank allows Google to evaluate the quality of web pages.
