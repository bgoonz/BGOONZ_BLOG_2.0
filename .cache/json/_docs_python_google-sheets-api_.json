Some of the obvious advantages are that they are free, easy to access, and easy to share. Moreover, Google spreadsheets can be especially powerful because of their ability to connect with tools like <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a> or <a href=\"https://phantombuster.com/\">Phantombuster</a> that can create automated workflows between a plethora of different online applications.</p>\n<p>Although these kinds of tools usually offer functionalities to automatically manipulate Google spreadsheets as well, I've experienced a lack of flexibility on how to update your spreadsheets. A customized Python script can offer way more flexibility and possibilities.</p>\n<p>To update your Google spreadsheets with Python, you can use the Google sheets API. Google offers free API access to several of their workspace apps, like Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Sheets. You can check out their API library <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?project=cellular-axon-327013\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Below I'll walk you through the steps to set up the Google Sheets API with Python and show a couple of basic examples of how to manipulate spreadsheets using the API.</p>\n<h1>Setting Up the API</h1>\n<h2>Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Platform project</h2>\n<p>To get started with any of the Google workspace APIs, you need to have a so-called Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. A GCP project forms the basis for all of Google's cloud computing services, including their API library. Setting up a project and using the APIs is completely free. Follow the steps outlined <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project\">here</a> to create your GCP project. It should be pretty straightforward.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Create Credentials</h2>\n<p>After creating a GCP project (step 1), we need to set up our credentials for accessing the API. Our credentials are like a key for the API to know who is requesting access to its data and services. You can follow the steps listed <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials\">here</a> to <em>create desktop application credentials</em>. In my experience, some steps were missing in this tutorial, so I'm giving the detailed version below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start by navigating back to your <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard\">Google Cloud Console</a>.</li>\n<li>Find the <em>APIs &#x26; Services</em> tab, and then select the <em>Credentials</em> page</li>\n<li>Click on *+Create Credentials *and select <em>OAuth client ID</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>Select <em>Desktop app</em> as the application type and give your app a name. Then click create.</li>\n<li>You will be prompted to set up your OAuth consent screen. Follow the steps you are prompted with and make sure to add yourself as a test user.</li>\n<li>After generating your client ID, you will be able to see it on your credentials page.</li>\n<li>Click the download button to download a JSON file with your credentials. Rename it to <em>credentials.json</em>. You will need this in the next step.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 3: Set up the API</h2>\n<p>After creating a GCP project and generating your credentials, it is time to connect to the API with Python for the first time. You can follow the steps outlined <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python\">here</a>. The steps given on the Google developers page are pretty self-explanatory. Three things I want to add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to have a look at the prerequisites before diving in.</li>\n<li>Don't forget to move your <em>credentials.json</em> file to the same folder where your <em>quickstart.py</em> file is.</li>\n<li>Change the URL in the SCOPE list in the quickstart script to <em><a href=\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets\">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets</a></em> to make sure that you have both read and write access.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If everything goes as expected, you should see this in your browser after running the sample script:</p>\n<p>After successfully running the sample, you will also find a <em>token.json</em> file in your workspace. This file is used for authentication on any of your future calls to the API. You're now ready to use the API!</p>\n<h1>Using the API</h1>\n<p>Now that we have set up the API connection, we can use the API to create, read, and edit Google spreadsheets! Extensive documentation on how to use the API can be found <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/create#python\">here</a>. I'll run through a few basic examples below.</p>\n<h2>Reading from an existing spreadsheet</h2>\n<p>Reading from an existing spreadsheet is a key functionality if you want to automate your spreadsheets. Let's create a new spreadsheet in the Google workspace and input some data. Below is a screenshot of the table I created.</p>\n<p>The API identifies spreadsheets using a spreadsheet ID. To connect to a spreadsheet that already exists, you can find the spreadsheet ID in the Google Sheets URL as follows:</p>\n<p>After identifying the spreadsheet ID of the spreadsheet we just created, we can use the API to connect to the spreadsheet and to read its data. Below is a code example of how to do this. The main functionalities to retrieve data from an existing spreadsheet are provided by sheet.values().get().execute()* <em>on line 17</em>. *Note that this is where we pass the spreadsheet ID and the range of values in the sheet we want to retrieve. All code before that establishes the connection to the API and is very similar to the <em>quickstart.py</em> file we used to connect to the API for the first time.</p>\n<p>The code returns a list of lists containing the data of our spreadsheet. Note that the data is returned row-by-row this way.</p>\n<h2>Writing to an existing spreadsheet</h2>\n<p>Next, let's try to add a new value to the spreadsheet. After all, this is the second key bit we need to automatically update our spreadsheets.</p>\n<p>The code below shows how to add a row to the existing data with the values [6, f]. Similar to reading values from an existing sheet, we need to start with establishing the connection to the API and identifying the spreadsheet ID. Because we are now writing new data to the spreadsheet, it is essential to make sure that you have not specified read-only permission in your SCOPES list (line 5).</p>\n<p>The main functionalities to append new data to an existing spreadsheet are provided by *sheet.values().append().execute() <em>on lines 17–22</em>. *Note that this is where we pass the spreadsheet ID, spreadsheet range, and several other parameters that specify how the data has to be inserted and what data has to be inserted. The <em>body</em> parameter takes a dictionary with values to append to the existing data table, using the same list-of-list format we saw before.</p>\n<p>After running the code, the spreadsheet is automatically updated with our new entry. The new row is neatly appended to the data that we manually wrote in the spreadsheet.</p>\n<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>\n<p>The Google workspace API library is a really powerful and relatively user-friendly way to automate workflows related to any of the Google workspace applications. In this tutorial, I walked you through setting up the Google Sheets API with Python and showed a few examples of how to manipulate spreadsheets using this API. The possibilities of how to use this are endless.</p>\n<p>Setting up access to the other APIs involves a very similar process and would allow for even more elaborate and complex automation flows.</p>","pages":[{"url":"/","relativePath":"index.md","relativeDir":"","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Dev Hub

Digital databases have been around since the 1960s. Relational databases, those which store \"related\" data, are the oldest and most common type of database in use today.</p>\n<h3><strong>Data Persistence</strong></h3>\n<p>A database is often necessary because our application or code requires data persistence. This term refers to data that is infrequently accessed and not likely to be modified. In less technical terms, the information will be safely stored and remain untouched unless intentionally modified.</p>\n<p>A familiar example of non-persistent data would be JavaScript objects and arrays, which reset each time the code runs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Relational Databases</strong></h3>\n<p>In relational databases, <strong>the data is stored in tabular format grouped into rows and columns</strong> (similar to spreadsheets). A collection of rows is called a table. Each row represents a single record in the table and is made up of one or more columns.</p>\n<p>These kinds of databases are relational because a <em>relation</em> is a mathematical idea equivalent to a table. So relational databases are databases that store their data in tables.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tables</strong></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2e309a41-e107-46f3-81e7-154d732d3dcf/Untitled.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Below are some basic facts about tables:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tables organize data in rows and columns.</li>\n<li>Each row in a table represents one distinct record.</li>\n<li>Each column represents a field or attribute that is common to all the records.</li>\n<li>Fields should have a descriptive name and a data type appropriate for the attribute it represents.</li>\n<li>Tables usually have more rows than columns.</li>\n<li>Tables have primary keys that uniquely identify each row.</li>\n<li>Foreign keys represent the relationships with other tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<h3>SQL:</h3>\n<p>SQL is a standard language, which means that it almost certainly will be supported, no matter how your database is managed. That said, be aware that the SQL language can vary depending on database management tools. This lesson focuses on a set of core commands that never change. Learning the standard commands is an excellent introduction since the knowledge transfers between database products.</p>\n<p>The syntax for SQL is English-like and requires fewer symbols than programming languages like C, Java, and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>It is declarative and concise, which means there is a lot less to learn to use it effectively.</p>\n<p>When learning SQL, it is helpful to understand that each command is designed for a different purpose. If we classify the commands by purpose, we'll end up with the following sub-categories of SQL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong>: used to modify database objects. Some examples are: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong>: used to manipulate the data stored in the database. Some examples are: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Query Language (DQL)</strong>: used to ask questions about the data stored in the database. The most commonly used SQL command is SELECT, and it falls in this category.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Control Language (DCL)</strong>: used to manage database security and user's access to data. These commands fall into the realm of Database Administrators. Some examples are GRANT and REVOKE.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction Control Commands</strong>: used for managing groups of statements that must execute as a unit or not execute at all. Examples are COMMIT and ROLLBACK.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a developer, you'll need to get familiar with DDL and become proficient using DML and DQL. This lesson will cover only DML and DQL commands.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>The four SQL operations covered in this section will allow a user to <strong>query</strong>, <strong>insert</strong>, and <strong>modify</strong> a database table.</p>\n<h3><strong>Query</strong></h3>\n<p>A <strong>query</strong> is a SQL statement used to retrieve data from a database. The command used to write queries is SELECT, and it is one of the most commonly used SQL commands.</p>\n<p>The basic syntax for a SELECT statement is this:</p>\n<p>To see all the fields on a table, we can use a * as the selection.</p>\n<p>The preceding statement would show all the records and all the columns for each record in the employees table.</p>\n<p>To pick the fields we want to see, we use a comma-separated list:</p>\n<p>The return of that statement would hold all records from the listed fields.</p>\n<p>We can extend the SELECT command's capabilities using clauses for things like filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.</p>\n<p>It is possible to query multiple tables in a single query. But, in this section, we only perform queries on a single table. We will cover performing queries on multiple tables in another section.</p>\n<h3><strong>Insert</strong></h3>\n<p>To <strong>insert</strong> new data into a table, we'll use the INSERT command. The basic syntax for an INSERT statement is this:</p>\n<p>Using this formula, we can specify which values will be inserted into which fields like so:</p>\n<h3><strong>Modify</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Modifying</strong> a database consists of updating and removing records. For these operations, we'll use UPDATE and DELETE commands, respectively.</p>\n<p>The basic syntax for an UPDATE statement is:</p>\n<p>The basic syntax for a DELETE statement is:</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Filtering results using WHERE clause</strong></h3>\n<p>When querying a database, the default result will be every entry in the given table. However, often, we are looking for a specific record or a set of records that meets certain criteria.</p>\n<p>A WHERE clause can help in both cases.</p>\n<p>Here's an example where we might only want to find customers living in Berlin.</p>\n<p>We can also chain together WHERE clauses using OR and AND to limit our results further.</p>\n<p>The following query includes only records that match both criteria.</p>\n<p>And this query includes records that match either criteria.</p>\n<p>These operators can be combined and grouped with parentheses to add complex selection logic. They behave similarly to what you're used to in programming languages.</p>\n<p>You can read more about SQLite operators from <a href=\"https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite/operators.php\">w3resource (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<p>To select a single record, we can use a WHERE statement with a uniquely identifying field, like an id:</p>\n<p>Other comparison operators also work in WHERE conditions, such as >, &#x3C;, &#x3C;=, and >=.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ordering results using the ORDER BY clause</strong></h3>\n<p>Query results are shown in the same order the data was inserted. To control how the data is sorted, we can use the ORDER BY clause. Let's see an example.</p>\n<p>We can pass a list of field names to order by and optionally choose asc or desc for the sort direction. The default is asc, so it doesn't need to be specified.</p>\n<p>Some SQL engines also support using field abbreviations when sorting.</p>\n<p>In this case, the results are sorted by the department in ascending order first and then by salary in descending order. The numbers refer to the fields' position in the <em>selection</em> portion of the query, so 1 would be <em>name</em>, 2 would be <em>salary</em>, and so on.</p>\n<p>Note that the WHERE clause should come after the FROM clause. The ORDER BY clause always goes last.</p>\n<h3><strong>Limiting results using the LIMIT clause</strong></h3>\n<p>When we wish to see only a limited number of records, we can use a LIMIT clause.</p>\n<p>The following returns the first ten records in the products table:</p>\n<p>LIMIT clauses are often used in conjunction with ORDER BY. The following shows us the five cheapest products:</p>\n<h3><strong>Inserting data using INSERT</strong></h3>\n<p>An insert statement adds a new record to the database. All non-null fields must be listed out in the same order as their values. Some fields, like ids and timestamps, may be auto-generated and do not need to be included in an INSERT statement.</p>\n<p>The values in an insert statement must not violate any restrictions and constraints that the database has in place, such as expected datatypes. We will learn more about constraints and schema design in a later section.</p>\n<h3><strong>Modifying recording using UPDATE</strong></h3>\n<p>When modifying a record, we identify a single record or a set of records to update using a WHERE clause. Then we can set the new value(s) in place.</p>\n<p>Technically the WHERE clause is not required, but leaving it off would result in every record within the table receiving the update.</p>\n<h3><strong>Removing records using DELETE</strong></h3>\n<p>When removing a record or set of records, we need only identify which record(s) to remove using a WHERE clause:</p>\n<p>Once again, the WHERE clause is not required, but leaving it off would remove every record in the table, so it's essential.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>Raw SQL is a critical baseline skill. However, Node developers generally use an <strong>Object Relational Mapper (ORM)</strong> or <strong>query builder</strong> to write database commands in a backend codebase. Both <strong>ORMs</strong> and <strong>query builders</strong> are JavaScript libraries that allow us to interface with the database using a JavaScript version of the SQL language.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of a raw SQL SELECT:</p>\n<p>We could use a query builder to write the same logic in JavaScript:</p>\n<p><strong>Query builders</strong> are lightweight and easy to get off the ground, whereas <strong>ORMs</strong> use an object-oriented model and provide more heavy lifting within their rigid structure.</p>\n<p>We will use a <strong>query builder</strong> called <a href=\"https://knexjs.org/\">knex.js (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Knex Setup</strong></h3>\n<p>To use Knex in a repository, we'll need to add two libraries:</p>\n<p>knex is our query builder library, and sqlite3 allows us to interface with a sqlite database. We'll learn more about sqlite and other <strong>database management systems</strong> in the following module. For now, know that you need both libraries.</p>\n<p>Next, we use Knex to set up a config file:</p>\n<p>To use the query builder elsewhere in our code, we need to call knex and pass in a config object. We'll be discussing Knex configuration more in a future module. Still, we only need the client, connection, and useNullAsDefault keys as shown above. The filename should point towards the pre-existing database file, which can be recognized by the .db3 extension.</p>\n<p><strong>GOTCHA</strong>: The file path to the database should be with respect to the <strong>root</strong> of the repo, not the configuration file itself.</p>\n<p>Once Knex is configured, we can import the above config file anywhere in our codebase to access the database.</p>\n<p>The db object provides methods that allow us to begin building queries.</p>\n<h3><strong>SELECT using Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>In Knex, the equivalent of SELECT * FROM users is:</p>\n<p>There's a simpler way to write the same command:</p>\n<p>Using this, we could write a GET endpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: All Knex queries return promises.</p>\n<p>Knex also allows for a where clause. In Knex, we could write SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1 as</p>\n<p>This method will resolve to an array containing a single entry like so: [{ id: 1, name: 'bill' }].</p>\n<p>Using this, we might add a GET endpoint where a specific user:</p>\n<h3><strong>INSERT using Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>In Knex, the equivalent of INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Eva', 32) is:</p>\n<p>The insert method in Knex will resolve to an array containing the newly created id for that user like so: [3].</p>\n<h3><strong>UPDATE using Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>In knex, the equivalent of UPDATE users SET name='Ava', age=33 WHERE id=3; is:</p>\n<p>Note that the where method comes before update, unlike in SQL.</p>\n<p>Update will resolve to a count of rows updated.</p>\n<h3><strong>DELETE using Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>In Knex, the equivalent of DELETE FROM users WHERE age=33; is:</p>\n<p>Once again, the where must come before the del. This method will resolve to a count of records removed.</p>\n<h1>Day #2:</h1>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>SQLlite Studio is an application that allows us to create, open, view, and modify SQLite databases. To fully understand what SQLite Studio is and how it works, we must also understand the concept of the Database Management Systems (DBMS).</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>What is a DBMS?</strong></h3>\n<p>To manage digital databases we use specialized software called <strong>D</strong>ata<strong>B</strong>ase <strong>M</strong>anagement <strong>S</strong>ystems (DBMS). These systems typically run on servers and are managed by <strong>D</strong>ata<strong>B</strong>ase <strong>A</strong>dministrators (DBAs).</p>\n<p>In less technical terms, we need a type of software that will allow us to create, access, and generally manage our databases. In the world of relational databases, we specifically use Relational Database Mangement Systems (RDBMs). Some examples are Postgres, SQLite, MySQL, and Oracle.</p>\n<p>Choosing a DBMS determines everything from how you set up your database, to where and how the data is stored, to what SQL commands you can use. Most systems share the core of the SQL language that you've already learned.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can expect SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, WHERE , and the like to be the same across all DBMSs, but the subtleties of the language may vary.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is SQLite?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>SQLite</strong> is the DBMS, as the name suggests, it is a more lightweight system and thus easier to get set up than some others.</p>\n<p>SQLite allows us to store databases as single files. SQLite projects have a .db3 extension. That is the database.</p>\n<p>SQLite is <em>not a database</em> (like relational, graph, or document are databases) but rather <em>a database management system</em>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Opening an existing database in SQLite Studio</strong></h3>\n<p>One useful visual interface we might use with a SQLite database is called <strong>SQLite Studio</strong>. <a href=\"https://sqlitestudio.pl/\">Install SQLITE Studio here. (Links to an external site.)</a></p>\n<p>Once installed, we can use SQLite Studio to open any .db3 file from a previous lesson. We may view the tables, view the data, and even make changes to the database.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed look at SQLite Studio, follow along in the video above.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>A <strong>database schema</strong> is the shape of our database. It defines what tables we'll have, which columns should exist within the tables and any restrictions on each column.</p>\n<p>A well-designed database schema keeps the data well organized and can help ensure high-quality data.</p>\n<p>Note that while schema design is usually left to Database Administrators (DBAs), understanding schema helps when designing APIs and database logic. And in a smaller team, this step may fall on the developer.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<p>For a look at schema design in SQLite Studio, follow along in the video above.</p>\n<p>When designing a single table, we need to ask three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What fields (or columns) are present?</li>\n<li>What type of data do we expect for each field?</li>\n<li>Are there other restrictions needed for each column?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the following schema diagram for an accounts table, we can the answer to each other those questions:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/9790405dda624818822293a383eec2d2\">Untitled</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Table Fields</strong></h3>\n<p>Choosing which fields to include in a table is relatively straight forward. What information needs to be tracked regarding this resource? In the real world, this is determined by the intended use of the product or app.</p>\n<p>However, this is one requirement every table should satisfy: a <strong>primary key</strong>. A primary key is a way to identify each entry in the database uniquely. It is most often represented as a auto-incrementing integer called id or [tablename]Id.</p>\n<h3><strong>Datatypes</strong></h3>\n<p>Each field must also have a specified datatype. The datatype available depends on our DBMS. Some supported datatype in SQLite include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Null:</strong> Missing or unknown information.</li>\n<li><strong>Integer:</strong> Whole numbers.</li>\n<li><strong>Real:</strong> Any number, including decimals.</li>\n<li><strong>Text:</strong> Character data.</li>\n<li><strong>Blob:</strong> a large binary object that can be used to store miscellaneous data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any data inserted into the table must match the datatypes determined in schema design.</p>\n<h3><strong>Constraints</strong></h3>\n<p>Beyond datatypes, we may add additional <strong>constraints</strong> on each field. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Not Null:</strong> The field cannot be left empty</li>\n<li><strong>Unique:</strong> No two records can have the same value in this field</li>\n<li><strong>Primary key:</strong> - Indicates this field is the primary key. Both the not null and unique constraints will be enforced.</li>\n<li><strong>Default:</strong> - Sets a default value if none is provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with data types, any data that does not satisfy the schema constraints will be rejected from the database.</p>\n<h3><strong>Multi-Table Design</strong></h3>\n<p>Another critical component of schema design is to understand how different tables relate to each other. This will be covered in later lesson.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>Knex provides a <strong>schema builder</strong>, which allows us to write code to design our database schema. However, beyond thinking about columns and constraints, we must also consider updates.</p>\n<p>When a schema needs to be updated, a developer must feel confident that the changes go into effect everywhere. This means schema updates on the developer's local machine, on any testing or staging versions, on the production database, and then on any other developer's local machines. This is where <strong>migrations</strong> come into play.</p>\n<p>A database migration describes changes made to the structure of a database. Migrations include things like adding new objects, adding new tables, and modifying existing objects or tables.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Knex Cli</strong></h3>\n<p>To use migrations (and to make Knex setup easier), we need to use <strong>knex cli</strong>. Install knex globally with npm install -g knex.</p>\n<p>This allows you to use Knex commands within any repo that has knex as a local dependency. If you have any issues with this global install, you can use the npx knex command instead.</p>\n<h3><strong>Initializing Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>To start, add the knex and sqlite3 libraries to your repository.</p>\n<p>npm install knex sqlite3</p>\n<p>We've seen how to use manually create a config object to get started with Knex, but the best practice is to use the following command:</p>\n<p>Or, if Knex isn't globally installed:</p>\n<p>This command will generate a file in your root folder called knexfile.js. It will be auto populated with three config objects, based on different environments. We can delete all except for the development object.</p>\n<p>We'll need to update the location (or desired location) of the database as well as add the useNullAsDefault option. The latter option prevents crashes when working with sqlite3.</p>\n<p>Now, wherever we configure our database, we may use the following syntax instead of hardcoding in a config object.</p>\n<h3><strong>Knex Migrations</strong></h3>\n<p>Once our knexfile is set up, we can begin creating <strong>migrations</strong>. Though it's not required, we are going to add an addition option to the config object to specify a directory for the migration files.</p>\n<p>We can generate a new migration with the following command:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:make [migration-name]</p>\n<p>If we needed to create an accounts table, we might run:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:make create-accounts</p>\n<p>Note that inside data/migrations/ a new file has appeared. Migrations have a timestamp in their filenames automatically. Wither you like this or not, <strong>do not edit migration names.</strong></p>\n<p>The migration file should have both an up and a down function. Within the up function, we write the ended database changes. Within the down function, we write the code to undo the up functions. This allows us to undo any changes made to the schema if necessary.</p>\n<p>References for these methods are found in the <strong>schema builder</strong> section of the <a href=\"https://knexjs.org/\">Knex docs (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, the table is <strong>not</strong> yet created. To run this (and any other) migrations, use the command:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:latest</p>\n<p>Note if the database does not exist, this command will auto-generate one. We can use SQLite Studio to confirm that the accounts table has been created.</p>\n<h3><strong>Changes and Rollbacks</strong></h3>\n<p>If later down the road, we realize you need to update your schema, you shouldn't edit the migration file. Instead, you will want to create a new migration with the command:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:make accounts-schema-update</p>\n<p>Once we've written our updates into this file we save and close with:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:latest</p>\n<p>If we migrate our database and then quickly realize something isn't right, we can edit the migration file. However, first, we need to <strong>rolllback</strong> (or undo) our last migration with:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:rollback</p>\n<p>Finally, we are free to rerun that file with knex migrate latest.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: A rollback should not be used to edit an old migration file once that file has accepted into a main branch. However, an entire team may use a rollback to return to a previous version of a database.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>Knex provides a <strong>schema builder</strong>, which allows us to write code to design our database schema.

However, an entire team may use a rollback to return to a previous version of a database.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>Often we want to pre-populate our database with sample data for testing. <strong>Seeds</strong> allow us to add and reset sample data easily.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<p>The Knex command-line tool offers a way to <strong>seed</strong> our database; in other words, pre-populate our tables.</p>\n<p>Similarly to migrations, we want to customize where our seed files are generated using our knexfile</p>\n<p>To create a seed run: knex seed:make 001-seedName</p>\n<p>Numbering is a good idea because Knex doesn't attach a timestamp to the name like migrate does. Adding numbers to the file name, we can control the order in which they run.</p>\n<p>We want to create seeds for our accounts table:</p>\n<p>knex seed:make 001-accounts</p>\n<p>A file will appear in the designated seed folder.</p>\n<p>Run the seed files by typing:</p>\n<p>knex seed:run</p>\n<p>You can now use SQLite Studio to confirm that the accounts table has two entries.</p>\n<h1>Day #3:</h1>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Foreign keys</strong> are a type of table field used for creating links between tables. Like <strong>primary keys</strong>, they are most often integers that identify (rather than store) data. However, whereas a primary key is used to id rows in a table, foreign keys are used to connect a record in one table to a record in a second table.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<p>Consider the following farms and ranchers tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/5b20c5e233dd4a70a33d6ab2c2e1c8bb\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/0b0a909c24a9474fb9df80938546f12a\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>The farm<em>id in the ranchers table is an example of a foreign key. Each entry in the farm</em>id (foreign key) column corresponds to an id (primary key) in the farms table. This allows us to track which farm each rancher belongs to while keeping the tables normalized.</p>\n<p>If we could only see the ranchers table, we would know that John, Jane, and Jen all work together and that Jim and Jay also work together. However, to know where any of them work, we would need to look at the farms table.</p>\n<p>Now that we understand the basics of querying data from a single table, let's move on to selecting data from multiple tables using JOIN operations.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>We can use a JOIN to combine query data from multiple tables using a single SELECT statement.</p>\n<p>There are different types of joins; some are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inner joins.</li>\n<li>outer joins.</li>\n<li>left joins.</li>\n<li>right joins.</li>\n<li>cross joins.</li>\n<li>non-equality joins.</li>\n<li>self joins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using joins requires that the two tables of interest contain at least one field with shared information. For example, if a <em>departments</em> table has an <em>id</em> field, and an employee table has a <em>department_id</em> field, and the values that exist in the <em>id</em> column of the <em>departments</em> table live in the <em>department_id</em> field of the employee table, we can use those fields to join both tables like so:</p>\n<p>This query will return the data from both tables for every instance where the ON condition is true. If there are employees with no value for department<em>id or where the value stored in the field does not correspond to an existing id in the</em> departments <em>table, then that record will NOT be returned. In a similar fashion, any records from the</em> departments <em>table that don't have an employee associated with them will also be omitted from the results. Basically, if the</em> id* does not show as the value of department_id for an employee, it won't be able to join.</p>\n<p>We can shorten the condition by giving the table names an alias. This is a common practice. Below is the same example using aliases, picking which fields to return and sorting the results:</p>\n<p>Notice that we can take advantage of white space and indentation to make queries more readable.</p>\n<p>There are several ways of writing joins, but the one shown here should work on all database management systems and avoid some pitfalls, so we recommend it.</p>\n<p>The syntax for performing a similar join using Knex is as follows:</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<p>A good explanation of how the different types of joins can be seen <a href=\"https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/sql-joins.php\">in this article from w3resource.com (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<h1>What is SQL Joins?</h1>\n<p>An SQL JOIN clause combines rows from two or more tables.

There is no proper id field (as multiple farms may have the same name), and multiple fields are representing the same type of data: animals.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/075ad6dd99ac48698625d7b56ca67bef\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>While we have now eliminated the first two issues, we now have multiple entries in one field, separated by commas. This isn't good either, as its another example of denormalization. There is no \"array\" data type in a relational database, so each field must contain only one data point.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/375a15b0cb3f444a8698cd6cb3a08fe0\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>Now we've solved the multiple fields issue, but we created repeating data (the farm field), which is also an example of denormalization. As well, we can see that if we were tracking additional ranch information (such as annual revenue), that field is only vaguely related to the animal information.</p>\n<p><strong>When these issues begin arising in your schema design, it means that you should separate information into two or more tables.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Anomalies</strong></h3>\n<p>Obeying the above guidelines prevent <strong>anomalies</strong> in your database when inserting, updating, or deleting. For example, imagine if the revenue of Beech Ranch changed. With our denormalized schema, it may get updated in some records but not others:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/e05f5b2e8ff141798adc6f188f56f31e\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>Similarly, if Beech Ranch shut down, there would be three (if not more) records that needed to be deleted to remove a single farm.</p>\n<p>Thus a denormalized table opens the door for contradictory, confusing, and unusable data.</p>\n<h2><strong>Challenge</strong></h2>\n<p>What issues does the following table have?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/2793e8f6b70a47f48f9208779366e69e\">Untitled</a></p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>There are three types of relationships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One to one.</li>\n<li>One to many.</li>\n<li>Many to many.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Determining how data is related can provide a set of guidelines for table representation and guides the use of foreign keys to connect said tables.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>One to One Relationships</strong></h3>\n<p>Imagine we are storing the financial projections for a series of farms.</p>\n<p>We may wish to attach fields like farm name, address, description, projected revenue, and projected expenses. We could divide these fields into two categories: information related to the farm directly (name, address, description) and information related to the financial projections (revenue, expenses).</p>\n<p>We would say that farms and projections have a <strong>one-to-one</strong> relationship. This is to say that every farm has exactly one projection, and every project corresponds to exactly one farm.</p>\n<p>This data can be represented in two tables: farms and projections</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/944e594f3464473ea06383bfdea13265\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/de32fcf6760e45f284707274433fee92\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>The farm_id is the foreign key that links farms and projections together.</p>\n<p>Notes about one-to-one relationships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The foreign key should always have a unique constraint to prevent duplicate entries. In the example above, we wouldn't want to allow multiple projections records for one farm.</li>\n<li>The foreign key can be in either table. For example, we may have had a projection_id in the farms table instead. A good rule of thumb is to put the foreign key in whichever table is more auxiliary to the other.</li>\n<li>You can represent one-to-one data in a single table <em>without</em> creating anomalies. However, it is sometimes prudent to use two tables as shown above to keep separate concerns in separate tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>One to Many Relationships</strong></h3>\n<p>Now imagine, we are storing the full-time ranchers employed at each farm. In this case, each rancher would only work at one farm however, each farm may have multiple ranchers.</p>\n<p>This is called a <strong>one-to-many</strong> relationship.</p>\n<p>This is the most common type of relationship between entities. Some other examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One customer can have many orders.</li>\n<li>One user can have many posts.</li>\n<li>One post can have many comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Manage this type of relationship by adding a foreign key on the \"many\" table of the relationship that points to the primary key on the \"one\" table. Consider the farms and ranchers tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/7dfd2e69c9804a01845f2e9b716a5ac2\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/c95f3d418db94ab4b4532eeba0e4f918\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>In a many-to-many relationship, the foreign key (in this case farm_id) should <em>not</em> be unique.</p>\n<h3><strong>Many to Many Relationships</strong></h3>\n<p>If we want to track animals on a farm as well, we must explore the <strong>many-to-many</strong> relationship. A farm has multiple animals, and multiple of each type of animal is present at multiple different farms.</p>\n<p>Some other examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an order can have many products and the same product will appear in many orders.</li>\n<li>a book can have more than one author, and an author can write more than one book.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To model this relationship, we need to introduce an <strong>intermediary table</strong> that holds foreign keys that reference the primary key on the related tables. We now have a farms, animals, and farm_animals table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/3269812d7c2a4578b1a9f6bc27e485b1\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/c2642c7f632f489cb1b9639c80b8400d\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/d0b0042c5e104edd9ed55e122af89084\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>While each foreign key on the intermediary table is not unique, the combinations of keys should be unique.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>The Knex query builder library also allows us to create multi-table schemas include foreign keys. However, there are a few extra things to keep in mind when designing a multi-table schema, such as using the correct order when creating tables, dropping tables, seeding data, and removing data.</p>\n<p>We have to consider the way that delete and updates through our API will impact related data.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Foreign Key Setup</strong></h3>\n<p>In Knex, foreign key restrictions don't automatically work. Whenever using foreign keys in your schema, add the following code to your knexfile. This will prevent users from entering bad data into a foreign key column.</p>\n<h3><strong>Migrations</strong></h3>\n<p>Let's look at how we might track our farms and ranchers using Knex. In our migration file's up function, we would want to create two tables:</p>\n<p>Note that the foreign key can only be created <em>after</em> the reference table.</p>\n<p>In the down function, the opposite is true. We always want to drop a table with a foreign key <em>before</em> dropping the table it references.</p>\n<p>In the case of a many-to-many relationship, the syntax for creating an intermediary table is identical, except for one additional piece. We need a way to make sure our combination of foreign keys is unique.</p>\n<h3><strong>Seeds</strong></h3>\n<p>Order is also a concern when seeding. We want to create seeds in the <strong>same</strong> order we created our tables. In other words, don't create a seed with a foreign key, until that reference record exists.</p>\n<p>In our example, make sure to write the 01-farms seed file and then the 02-ranchers seed file.</p>\n<p>However, we run into a problem with truncating our seeds, because we want to truncate 02-ranchers <em>before</em> 01-farms. A library called knex-cleaner provides an easy solution for us.</p>\n<p>Run knex seed:make 00-cleanup and npm install knex-cleaner. Inside the cleanup seed, use the following code.</p>\n<p>This removes all tables (excluding the two tables that track migrations) in the correct order before any seed files run.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cascading</strong></h3>\n<p>If a user attempt to delete a record that is referenced by another record (such as attempting to delete Morton Ranch when entries in our ranchers table reference that record), by default, the database will block the action. The same thing can happen when updating a record when a foreign key reference.</p>\n<p>If we want that to override this default, we can delete or update with <strong>cascade</strong>. With cascade, deleting a record also deletes all referencing records, we can set that up in our schema.</p>"},{"url":"/blog/flow-control-in-python/","relativePath":"blog/flow-control-in-python.md","relativeDir":"blog","base":"flow-control-in-python.md","name":"flow-control-in-python","frontmatter":{"title":"flow-control-in-python","subtitle":"flow-control-in-python","date":"2021-10-14","thumb_image_alt":"lorem-ipsum","excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"post","thumb_image":"images/python1.jpg","image":"images/python2-15e88a3a.jpg"},"html":"<h2>Read It</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wilfredinni/python-cheatsheet\">Github</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wilfredinni/Python-cheatsheet/raw/master/python_cheat_sheet.pdf\">PDF</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wilfredinni/python-cheatsheet/master?filepath=jupyter_notebooks\">Jupyter Notebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Flow Control</h2>\n<h3>Comparison Operators</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Operator</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code>==</code></td>\n<td>Equal to</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>!=</code></td>\n<td>Not equal to</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>&#x3C;</code></td>\n<td>Less than</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>></code></td>\n<td>Greater Than</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>&#x3C;=</code></td>\n<td>Less than or Equal to</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>>=</code></td>\n<td>Greater than or Equal to</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These operators evaluate to True or False depending on the values you give them.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">42 == 42\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">40 == 42\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">'hello' == 'hello'\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">'hello' == 'Hello'\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">'dog' != 'cat'\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">42 == 42.0\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">42 == '42'\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Boolean evaluation</h3>\n<p>Never use <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> operator to evaluate boolean operation.

Modern operating systems like Linux and macOS both include built-in Unix command line terminals. This makes Linux and macOS complementary operating systems when working with Git. Microsoft Windows instead uses Windows command prompt, a non-Unix terminal environment.</p>\n<p>In Windows environments, Git is often packaged as part of higher level GUI applications. GUIs for Git may attempt to abstract and hide the underlying version control system primitives. This can be a great aid for Git beginners to rapidly contribute to a project. Once a project's collaboration requirements grow with other team members, it is critical to be aware of how the actual raw Git methods work. This is when it can be beneficial to drop a GUI version for the command line tools. Git Bash is offered to provide a terminal Git experience.</p>\n<h2>What is Git Bash?</h2>\n<p>Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience. Bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell. A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system through written commands. Bash is a popular default shell on Linux and macOS. Git Bash is a package that installs Bash, some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system.</p>\n<h2>How to install Git Bash</h2>\n<p>Git Bash comes included as part of the <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\">Git For Windows</a> package. Download and install Git For Windows like other Windows applications. Once downloaded find the included <code>.exe</code> file and open to execute Git Bash.</p>\n<h2>How to use Git Bash</h2>\n<p>Git Bash has the same operations as a standard Bash experience. It will be helpful to review basic Bash usage. Advanced usage of Bash is outside the scope of this Git focused document.</p>\n<h2>How to navigate folders</h2>\n<p>The Bash command <code>pwd</code> is used to print the 'present working directory'. <code>pwd</code> is equivalent to executing cd on a DOS(Windows console host) terminal. This is the folder or path that the current Bash session resides in.</p>\n<p>The Bash command <code>ls</code> is used to 'list' contents of the current working directory. <code>ls</code> is equivalent to <code>DIR</code> on a Windows console host terminal.</p>\n<p>Both Bash and Windows console host have a cd command. cd is an acronym for 'Change Directory'. cd is invoked with an appended directory name. Executing cd will change the terminal sessions current working directory to the passed directory argument.</p>\n<h2>Git Bash Commands</h2>\n<p>Git Bash is packaged with additional commands that can be found in the <code>/usr/bin</code> directory of the Git Bash emulation. Git Bash can actually provide a fairly robust shell experience on Windows. Git Bash comes packaged with the following shell commands which are outside the scope of this document: <code>[Ssh](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1)</code>, <code>[scp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp)</code>, <code>[cat](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html)</code>, <code>[find](https://linux.die.net/man/1/find)</code>.</p>\n<p>In addition the previously discussed set of Bash commands, Git Bash includes the full set of Git core commands discussed through out this site.

You can use it with any static site generator to create faster, more flexible web projects. Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.</p>\n<p>At its core, Netlify CMS is an open-source React app that acts as a wrapper for the Git workflow, using the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket API. This provides many advantages, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fast, web-based UI:</strong> With rich-text editing, real-time preview, and drag-and-drop media uploads.</li>\n<li><strong>Platform agnostic:</strong> Works with most static site generators.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy installation:</strong> Add two files to your site and hook up the backend by including those files in your build process or linking to our Content Delivery Network (CDN).</li>\n<li><strong>Modern authentication:</strong> Using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and JSON web tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible content types:</strong> Specify an unlimited number of content types with custom fields.</li>\n<li><strong>Fully extensible:</strong> Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Netlify CMS vs. Netlify</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify.com</a> is a platform you can use to automatically build, deploy, serve, and manage your frontend sites and web apps. It also provides a variety of other features like form processing, serverless functions, and split testing. Not all Netlify sites use Netlify CMS, and not all sites using Netlify CMS are on Netlify.</p>\n<p>The folks at Netlify created Netlify CMS to fill a gap in the static site generation pipeline. There were some great proprietary headless CMS options, but no real contenders that were open source and extensible—that could turn into a community-built ecosystem like WordPress or Drupal. For that reason, Netlify CMS is <em>made</em> to be community-driven, and has never been locked to the Netlify platform (despite the name).</p>\n<p>With this in mind, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Netlify CMS without Netlify and deploy your site where you always have, hooking up your own CI, site hosting, CDN, etc.</li>\n<li>Use Netlify without Netlify CMS and edit your static site in your code editor.</li>\n<li>Or, use them together and have a fully-working CMS-enabled site with <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/\">one click</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you hook up Netlify CMS to your website, you're basically adding a tool for content editors to make commits to your site repository without touching code or learning Git.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add to Your Site<strong>These generatorsstore static files in</strong>Jekyll, GitBook/ (project root)Hugo, Gatsby, Nuxt, Gridsome, Zola, Sapper/staticNext/publicHexo, Middleman, Jigsaw/sourceSpike/viewsWyam/inputPelican/contentVuePress/.vuepress/publicElmstatic/_site11ty/_sitepreact-cli/src/staticnamePost type identifier, used in routes.

It works with any content written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/\">GitLab</a>, or <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\">Bitbucket</a>. You can also create your own custom backend.</p>\n<p>This tutorial guides you through the steps for adding Netlify CMS to a site that's built with a common <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\">static site generator</a>, like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, you can <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template\">start from a template</a> or dive right into <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options\">configuration options</a>.</p>\n<h2>App File Structure</h2>\n<p>A static admin folder contains all Netlify CMS files, stored at the root of your published site. Where you store this folder in the source files depends on your static site generator. Here's the static file location for a few of the most popular static site generators:</p>\n<p>If your generator isn't listed here, you can check its documentation, or as a shortcut, look in your project for a css or images folder. The contents of folders like that are usually processed as static files, so it's likely you can store your admin folder next to those. (When you've found the location, feel free to add it to these docs by <a href=\"https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests\">filing a pull request</a>!)</p>\n<p>Inside the admin folder, you'll create two files:</p>\n<p>The first file, admin/index.html, is the entry point for the Netlify CMS admin interface. This means that users navigate to yoursite.com/admin/ to access it. On the code side, it's a basic HTML starter page that loads the Netlify CMS JavaScript file. The second file, admin/config.yml, is the heart of your Netlify CMS installation, and a bit more complex. The <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#configuration\">Configuration</a> section covers the details.</p>\n<p>In this example, we pull the admin/index.html file from a public CDN.</p>\n<p>In the code above the script is loaded from the unpkg CDN. Should there be any issue, jsDelivr can be used as an alternative source. Simply set the src to <a href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/netlify-cms@%5E2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js\">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js</a></p>\n<h3>Installing with npm</h3>\n<p>You can also use Netlify CMS as an npm module. Wherever you import Netlify CMS, it automatically runs, taking over the current page. Make sure the script that imports it only runs on your CMS page. First install the package and save it to your project:</p>\n<p>Then import it (assuming your project has tooling for imports):</p>\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Configuration is different for every site, so we'll break it down into parts. Add all the code snippets in this section to your admin/config.yml file.</p>\n<h3>Backend</h3>\n<p>We're using <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> for our hosting and authentication in this tutorial, so backend configuration is fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p>For GitHub and GitLab repositories, you can start your Netlify CMS config.yml file with these lines:</p>\n<p><em>(For Bitbucket repositories, use the _[</em>Bitbucket backend<em>](<a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/bitbucket-backend\">https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/bitbucket-backend</a>)</em> instructions instead.)_</p>\n<p>The configuration above specifies your backend protocol and your publication branch. Git Gateway is an open source API that acts as a proxy between authenticated users of your site and your site repo. (We'll get to the details of that in the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication\">Authentication section</a> below.) If you leave out the branch declaration, it defaults to master.</p>\n<h3>Editorial Workflow</h3>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Editorial workflow works with GitHub repositories, and support for GitLab and Bitbucket is <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/beta-features/#gitlab-and-bitbucket-editorial-workflow-support\">in beta</a>.</p>\n<p>By default, saving a post in the CMS interface pushes a commit directly to the publication branch specified in backend. However, you also have the option to enable the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/#publish-mode\">Editorial Workflow</a>, which adds an interface for drafting, reviewing, and approving posts. To do this, add the following line to your Netlify CMS config.yml:</p>\n<h3>Media and Public Folders</h3>\n<p>Netlify CMS allows users to upload images directly within the editor. For this to work, the CMS needs to know where to save them. If you already have an images folder in your project, you could use its path, possibly creating an uploads sub-folder, for example:</p>\n<p>If you're creating a new folder for uploaded media, you'll need to know where your static site generator expects static files. You can refer to the paths outlined above in <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#app-file-structure\">App File Structure</a>, and put your media folder in the same location where you put the admin folder.</p>\n<p>Note that themedia_folder file path is relative to the project root, so the example above would work for Jekyll, GitBook, or any other generator that stores static files at the project root. However, it would not work for Hugo, Hexo, Middleman or others that store static files in a subfolder. Here's an example that could work for a Hugo site:</p>\n<p>The configuration above adds a new setting, public<em>folder. While media</em>folder specifies where uploaded files are saved in the repo, public_folder indicates where they are found in the published site. Image src attributes use this path, which is relative to the file where it's called. For this reason, we usually start the path at the site root, using the opening /.</p>\n<p><em>If public</em>folder is not set, Netlify CMS defaults to the same value as media<em>folder, adding an opening / if one is not included.</em></p>\n<h3>Collections</h3>\n<p>Collections define the structure for the different content types on your static site. Since every site is different, the collections settings differ greatly from one site to the next.</p>\n<p>Let's say your site has a blog, with the posts stored in _posts/blog, and files saved in a date-title format, like 1999-12-31-lets-party.md. Each post begins with settings in yaml-formatted front matter, like so:</p>\n<p>Given this example, our collections settings would look like this in your NetlifyCMS config.yml file:</p>\n<p>Let's break that down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>label: Field label in the editor UI.</li>\n<li>name: Field name in the document front matter.</li>\n<li>widget: Determines UI style and value data type (details below).</li>\n<li>default (optional): Sets a default value for the field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As described above, the widget property specifies a built-in or custom UI widget for a given field. When a content editor enters a value into a widget, that value is saved in the document front matter as the value for the name specified for that field. A full listing of available widgets can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets\">Widgets doc</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on this example, you can go through the post types in your site and add the appropriate settings to your Netlify CMS config.yml file. Each post type should be listed as a separate node under the collections field. See the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/#collections\">Collections reference doc</a> for more configuration options.</p>\n<h3>Filter</h3>\n<p>The entries for any collection can be filtered based on the value of a single field. The example collection below only shows post entries with the value en in the language field.</p>\n<h2>Authentication</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your Netlify CMS files in place and configured, all that's left is to enable authentication. We're using the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> platform here because it's one of the quickest ways to get started, but you can learn about other authentication options in the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/backends-overview\">Backends</a> doc.</p>\n<h3>Setup on Netlify</h3>\n<p>Netlify offers a built-in authentication service called Identity. In order to use it, connect your site repo with Netlify. Netlify has published a general <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/\">Step-by-Step Guide</a> for this, along with detailed guides for many popular static site generators, including <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/21/a-step-by-step-guide-victor-hugo-on-netlify/\">Hugo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/26/a-step-by-step-guide-hexo-on-netlify/\">Hexo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/01/a-step-by-step-guide-middleman-on-netlify/\">Middleman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/\">Gatsby</a>, and more.</p>\n<h3>Enable Identity and Git Gateway</h3>\n<p>Netlify's Identity and Git Gateway services allow you to manage CMS admin users for your site without requiring them to have an account with your Git host or commit access on your repo. From your site dashboard on Netlify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Settings > Identity</strong>, and select <strong>Enable Identity service</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Registration preferences</strong>, select <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Invite only</strong>. In most cases, you want only invited users to access your CMS, but if you're just experimenting, you can leave it open for convenience.</li>\n<li>If you'd like to allow one-click login with services like Google and GitHub, check the boxes next to the services you'd like to use, under <strong>External providers</strong>.</li>\n<li>Scroll down to <strong>Services > Git Gateway</strong>, and click <strong>Enable Git Gateway</strong>. This authenticates with your Git host and generates an API access token. In this case, we're leaving the <strong>Roles</strong> field blank, which means any logged in user may access the CMS. For information on changing this, check the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/\">Netlify Identity documentation</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Add the Netlify Identity Widget</h3>\n<p>With the backend set to handle authentication, now you need a frontend interface to connect to it. The open source Netlify Identity Widget is a drop-in widget made for just this purpose. To include the widget in your site, add the following script tag in two places:</p>\n<p>Add this to the &#x3C;head> of your CMS index page at /admin/index.html, as well as the &#x3C;head> of your site's main index page. Depending on how your site generator is set up, this may mean you need to add it to the default template, or to a \"partial\" or \"include\" template. If you can find where the site stylesheet is linked, that's probably the right place. Alternatively, you can include the script in your site using Netlify's <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/inject-analytics-snippets/\">Script Injection</a> feature.</p>\n<p>When a user logs in with the Netlify Identity widget, an access token directs to the site homepage. In order to complete the login and get back to the CMS, redirect the user back to the /admin/ path. To do this, add the following script before the closing body tag of your site's main index page:</p>\n<p>Note: This example script requires modern JavaScript and does not work on IE11. For legacy browser support, use function expressions (function () {}) in place of the arrow functions (() => {}), or use a transpiler such as <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>.</p>\n<h2>Accessing the CMS</h2>\n<p>Your site CMS is now fully configured and ready for login!</p>\n<p>If you set your registration preference to \"Invite only,\" invite yourself (and anyone else you choose) as a site user. To do this, select the <strong>Identity</strong> tab from your site dashboard, and then select the <strong>Invite users</strong> button. Invited users receive an email invitation with a confirmation link. Clicking the link will take you to your site with a login prompt.</p>\n<p>If you left your site registration open, or for return visits after confirming an email invitation, access your site's CMS at yoursite.com/admin/.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> No matter where you access Netlify CMS — whether running locally, in a staging environment, or in your published site — it always fetches and commits files in your hosted repository (for example, on GitHub), on the branch you configured in your Netlify CMS config.yml file. This means that content fetched in the admin UI matches the content in the repository, which may be different from your locally running site. It also means that content saved using the admin UI saves directly to the hosted repository, even if you're running the UI locally or in staging.</p>\n<p>Examples</p>\n<p>Do\nyou have a great, open source example?

Run the following commands in the terminal, in the folder where you'd like to create the blog:</p>\n<h2>Get to know Gatsby</h2>\n<p>In your favorite code editor, open up the code generated for your \"Gatsby Starter Blog\" site, and take a look at the content directory.</p>\n<p>You will see that there are multiple Markdown files that represent blog posts. Open one .md file and you will see something like this:</p>\n<p>We can see above that each blog post has a title, a date, a description and a body. Now, let's recreate this using Netlify CMS.</p>\n<h2>Add Netlify CMS to your site</h2>\n<p>First let's install some dependencies. We'll need netlify-cms-app and gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms. Run the following command in the terminal at the root of your site:</p>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>For the purpose of this guide we will deploy to Netlify from a GitHub repository which requires the minimum configuration.</p>\n<p>Create a config.yml file in the directory structure you see below:</p>\n<p>In your config.yml file paste the following configuration:</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above configuration allows assets to be stored relative to their content. Therefore posts would be stored in the format below as it is in gatsby-starter-blog.</p>\n<p>Finally, add the plugin to your gatsby-config.js.</p>\n<h3>Push to GitHub</h3>\n<p>It's now time to commit your changes and push to GitHub. The Gatsby starter initializes Git automatically for you, so you only need to do:</p>\n<h3>Add your repo to Netlify</h3>\n<p>Go to Netlify and select 'New Site from Git'. Select GitHub and the repository you just pushed to. Click Configure Netlify on GitHub and give access to your repository. Finish the setup by clicking Deploy Site. Netlify will begin reading your repository and starting building your project.</p>\n<h3>Enable Identity and Git Gateway</h3>\n<p>Netlify's Identity and Git Gateway services allow you to manage CMS admin users for your site without requiring them to have an account with your Git host or commit access on your repo. From your site dashboard on Netlify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Settings > Identity</strong>, and select <strong>Enable Identity service</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Registration preferences</strong>, select <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Invite only</strong>. In most cases, you want only invited users to access your CMS, but if you're just experimenting, you can leave it open for convenience.</li>\n<li>If you'd like to allow one-click login with services like Google and GitHub, check the boxes next to the services you'd like to use, under <strong>External providers</strong>.</li>\n<li>Scroll down to <strong>Services > Git Gateway</strong>, and click <strong>Enable Git Gateway</strong>. This authenticates with your Git host and generates an API access token. In this case, we're leaving the <strong>Roles</strong> field blank, which means any logged in user may access the CMS. For information on changing this, check the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/\">Netlify Identity documentation</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Start publishing</h2>\n<p>It's time to create your first blog post. Login to your site's /admin/ page and create a new post by clicking New Blog. Add a title, a date and some text. When you click Publish, a new commit will be created in your GitHub repo with this format Create Blog \"year-month-date-title\".</p>\n<p>Then Netlify will detect that there was a commit in your repo, and will start rebuilding your project. When your project is deployed you'll be able to see the post you created.</p>\n<h3>Cleanup</h3>\n<p>It is now safe to remove the default Gatsby blog posts.</p>"},{"url":"/blog/platform-docs/","relativePath":"blog/platform-docs.md","relativeDir":"blog","base":"platform-docs.md","name":"platform-docs","frontmatter":{"title":"Netlify CMS Intro","date":"2021-05-23","image":"images/curious-europa.gif","seo":{"title":"Platform Docs","description":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit","extra":[{"name":"og:type","value":"article","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:title","value":"Platform Docs","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:description","value":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:image","value":"images/curious-europa.gif","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":true},{"name":"twitter:card","value":"summary_large_image"},{"name":"twitter:title","value":"Platform Docs"},{"name":"twitter:description","value":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit"},{"name":"twitter:image","value":"images/curious-europa.gif","relativeUrl":true}]},"template":"post","thumb_image":"images/redu-squarex.jpg"},"html":"<h1>Add to Your Site | Netlify CMS</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Open source content management for your Git workflow</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can adapt Netlify CMS to a wide variety of projects. It works with any content written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/\">GitLab</a>, or <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\">Bitbucket</a>. You can also create your own custom backend.</p>\n<p>This tutorial guides you through the steps for adding Netlify CMS to a site that's built with a common <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\">static site generator</a>, like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, you can <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/start-with-a-template\">start from a template</a> or dive right into <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/configuration-options\">configuration options</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#app-file-structure\"></a>App File Structure</h2>\n<p>A static <code>admin</code> folder contains all Netlify CMS files, stored at the root of your published site. Where you store this folder in the source files depends on your static site generator. Here's the static file location for a few of the most popular static site generators:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>These generators</th>\n<th>store static files in</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Jekyll, GitBook</td>\n<td><code>/</code> (project root)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hugo, Gatsby, Nuxt, Gridsome, Zola, Sapper</td>\n<td><code>/static</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Next</td>\n<td><code>/public</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hexo, Middleman, Jigsaw</td>\n<td><code>/source</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spike</td>\n<td><code>/views</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyam</td>\n<td><code>/input</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pelican</td>\n<td><code>/content</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VuePress</td>\n<td><code>/.vuepress/public</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elmstatic</td>\n<td><code>/_site</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11ty</td>\n<td><code>/_site</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>preact-cli</td>\n<td><code>/src/static</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If your generator isn't listed here, you can check its documentation, or as a shortcut, look in your project for a <code>css</code> or <code>images</code> folder. The contents of folders like that are usually processed as static files, so it's likely you can store your <code>admin</code> folder next to those. (When you've found the location, feel free to add it to these docs by <a href=\"https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests\">filing a pull request</a>!)</p>\n<p>Inside the <code>admin</code> folder, you'll create two files:</p>\n<pre><code>admin\n ├ index.html\n └ config.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first file, <code>admin/index.html</code>, is the entry point for the Netlify CMS admin interface. This means that users navigate to <code>yoursite.com/admin/</code> to access it. On the code side, it's a basic HTML starter page that loads the Netlify CMS JavaScript file. In this example, we pull the file from a public CDN:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\n&#x3C;html>\n&#x3C;head>\n  &#x3C;meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n  &#x3C;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n  &#x3C;title>Content Manager&#x3C;/title>\n&#x3C;/head>\n&#x3C;body>\n\n  &#x3C;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n&#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the code above the <code>script</code> is loaded from the <code>unpkg</code> CDN. Should there be any issue, <code>jsDelivr</code> can be used as an alternative source. Simply set the <code>src</code> to <code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js</code></p>\n<p>The second file, <code>admin/config.yml</code>, is the heart of your Netlify CMS installation, and a bit more complex. The <a href=\"#configuration\">Configuration</a> section covers the details.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#installing-with-npm\"></a>Installing with npm</h3>\n<p>You can also use Netlify CMS as an npm module. Wherever you import Netlify CMS, it automatically runs, taking over the current page. Make sure the script that imports it only runs on your CMS page. First install the package and save it to your project:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install netlify-cms-app --save\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then import it (assuming your project has tooling for imports):</p>\n<pre><code>import CMS from 'netlify-cms-app'\n\nCMS.init()\n\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('my-template', MyTemplate)\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#configuration\"></a>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Configuration is different for every site, so we'll break it down into parts. Add all the code snippets in this section to your <code>admin/config.yml</code> file.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#backend\"></a>Backend</h3>\n<p>We're using <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> for our hosting and authentication in this tutorial, so backend configuration is fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p>For GitHub and GitLab repositories, you can start your Netlify CMS <code>config.yml</code> file with these lines:</p>\n<pre><code>backend:\n  name: git-gateway\n  branch: master\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>(For Bitbucket repositories, use the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/bitbucket-backend\">Bitbucket backend</a> instructions instead.)</em></p>\n<p>The configuration above specifies your backend protocol and your publication branch. Git Gateway is an open source API that acts as a proxy between authenticated users of your site and your site repo. (We'll get to the details of that in the <a href=\"#authentication\">Authentication section</a> below.) If you leave out the <code>branch</code> declaration, it defaults to <code>master</code>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#editorial-workflow\"></a>Editorial Workflow</h3>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Editorial workflow works with GitHub repositories, and support for GitLab and Bitbucket is <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/beta-features/#gitlab-and-bitbucket-editorial-workflow-support\">in beta</a>.</p>\n<p>By default, saving a post in the CMS interface pushes a commit directly to the publication branch specified in <code>backend</code>. However, you also have the option to enable the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/configuration-options/#publish-mode\">Editorial Workflow</a>, which adds an interface for drafting, reviewing, and approving posts. To do this, add the following line to your Netlify CMS <code>config.yml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>publish_mode: editorial_workflow\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a href=\"#media-and-public-folders\"></a>Media and Public Folders</h3>\n<p>Netlify CMS allows users to upload images directly within the editor. For this to work, the CMS needs to know where to save them. If you already have an <code>images</code> folder in your project, you could use its path, possibly creating an <code>uploads</code> sub-folder, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>media_folder: \"images/uploads\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you're creating a new folder for uploaded media, you'll need to know where your static site generator expects static files. You can refer to the paths outlined above in <a href=\"#app-file-structure\">App File Structure</a>, and put your media folder in the same location where you put the <code>admin</code> folder.</p>\n<p>Note that the<code>media_folder</code> file path is relative to the project root, so the example above would work for Jekyll, GitBook, or any other generator that stores static files at the project root. However, it would not work for Hugo, Hexo, Middleman or others that store static files in a subfolder. Here's an example that could work for a Hugo site:</p>\n<pre><code>media_folder: \"static/images/uploads\"\npublic_folder: \"/images/uploads\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The configuration above adds a new setting, <code>public_folder</code>. While <code>media_folder</code> specifies where uploaded files are saved in the repo, <code>public_folder</code> indicates where they are found in the published site. Image <code>src</code> attributes use this path, which is relative to the file where it's called. For this reason, we usually start the path at the site root, using the opening <code>/</code>.</p>\n<p><em>If `public</em>folder<code>is not set, Netlify CMS defaults to the same value as</code>media<em>folder<code>, adding an opening</code>/` if one is not included.</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#collections\"></a>Collections</h3>\n<p>Collections define the structure for the different content types on your static site. Since every site is different, the <code>collections</code> settings differ greatly from one site to the next.</p>\n<p>Let's say your site has a blog, with the posts stored in <code>_posts/blog</code>, and files saved in a date-title format, like <code>1999-12-31-lets-party.md</code>. Each post begins with settings in yaml-formatted front matter, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: blog\ntitle: \"Let's Party\"\ndate: 1999-12-31 11:59:59 -0800\nthumbnail: \"/images/prince.jpg\"\nrating: 5\n---\n\nThis is the post body, where I write about our last chance to party before the Y2K bug destroys us all.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Given this example, our <code>collections</code> settings would look like this in your NetlifyCMS <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>collections:\n  - name: \"blog\"\n    label: \"Blog\"\n    folder: \"_posts/blog\"\n    create: true\n    slug: \"{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}-{{slug}}\"\n    fields:\n      - {label: \"Layout\", name: \"layout\", widget: \"hidden\", default: \"blog\"}\n      - {label: \"Title\", name: \"title\", widget: \"string\"}\n      - {label: \"Publish Date\", name: \"date\", widget: \"datetime\"}\n      - {label: \"Featured Image\", name: \"thumbnail\", widget: \"image\"}\n      - {label: \"Rating (scale of 1-5)\", name: \"rating\", widget: \"number\"}\n      - {label: \"Body\", name: \"body\", widget: \"markdown\"}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's break that down:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><code>name</code></td><td>Post type identifier, used in routes. Must be unique.</td></tr><tr><td><code>label</code></td><td>What the admin UI calls the post type.</td></tr><tr><td><code>folder</code></td><td>Where files of this type are stored, relative to the repo root.</td></tr><tr><td><code>create</code></td><td>Set to <code>true</code> to allow users to create new files in this collection.</td></tr><tr><td><code>slug</code></td><td>Template for filenames. <code>{{year}}</code>, <code>{{month}}</code>, and <code>{{day}}</code> pulls from the post's <code>date</code> field or save date. <code>{{slug}}</code> is a url-safe version of the post's <code>title</code>. Default is simply <code>{{slug}}</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>fields</code></td><td>Fields listed here are shown as fields in the content editor, then saved as front matter at the beginning of the document (except for <code>body</code>, which follows the front matter). Each field contains the following properties:<ul><li><code>label</code>: Field label in the editor UI.</li><li><code>name</code>: Field name in the document front matter.</li><li><code>widget</code>: Determines UI style and value data type (details below).</li><li><code>default</code> (optional): Sets a default value for the field.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>As described above, the <code>widget</code> property specifies a built-in or custom UI widget for a given field. When a content editor enters a value into a widget, that value is saved in the document front matter as the value for the <code>name</code> specified for that field. A full listing of available widgets can be found in the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/widgets\">Widgets doc</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on this example, you can go through the post types in your site and add the appropriate settings to your Netlify CMS <code>config.yml</code> file. Each post type should be listed as a separate node under the <code>collections</code> field. See the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/configuration-options/#collections\">Collections reference doc</a> for more configuration options.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#filter\"></a>Filter</h3>\n<p>The entries for any collection can be filtered based on the value of a single field. The example collection below only shows post entries with the value <code>en</code> in the <code>language</code> field.</p>\n<pre><code>collections:\n  - name: \"posts\"\n    label: \"Post\"\n    folder: \"_posts\"\n    filter:\n      field: language\n      value: en\n    fields:\n      - {label: \"Language\", name: \"language\"}\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#authentication\"></a>Authentication</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your Netlify CMS files in place and configured, all that's left is to enable authentication. We're using the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> platform here because it's one of the quickest ways to get started, but you can learn about other authentication options in the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/backends-overview\">Backends</a> doc.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#setup-on-netlify\"></a>Setup on Netlify</h3>\n<p>Netlify offers a built-in authentication service called Identity. In order to use it, connect your site repo with Netlify. Netlify has published a general <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/\">Step-by-Step Guide</a> for this, along with detailed guides for many popular static site generators, including <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/21/a-step-by-step-guide-victor-hugo-on-netlify/\">Hugo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/26/a-step-by-step-guide-hexo-on-netlify/\">Hexo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/01/a-step-by-step-guide-middleman-on-netlify/\">Middleman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/\">Gatsby</a>, and more.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#enable-identity-and-git-gateway\"></a>Enable Identity and Git Gateway</h3>\n<p>Netlify's Identity and Git Gateway services allow you to manage CMS admin users for your site without requiring them to have an account with your Git host or commit access on your repo. From your site dashboard on Netlify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Settings > Identity</strong>, and select <strong>Enable Identity service</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Registration preferences</strong>, select <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Invite only</strong>. In most cases, you want only invited users to access your CMS, but if you're just experimenting, you can leave it open for convenience.</li>\n<li>If you'd like to allow one-click login with services like Google and GitHub, check the boxes next to the services you'd like to use, under <strong>External providers</strong>.</li>\n<li>Scroll down to <strong>Services > Git Gateway</strong>, and click <strong>Enable Git Gateway</strong>. This authenticates with your Git host and generates an API access token. In this case, we're leaving the <strong>Roles</strong> field blank, which means any logged in user may access the CMS. For information on changing this, check the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/\">Netlify Identity documentation</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a href=\"#add-the-netlify-identity-widget\"></a>Add the Netlify Identity Widget</h3>\n<p>With the backend set to handle authentication, now you need a frontend interface to connect to it. The open source Netlify Identity Widget is a drop-in widget made for just this purpose. To include the widget in your site, add the following script tag in two places:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;script src=\"https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add this to the <code>&#x3C;head></code> of your CMS index page at <code>/admin/index.html</code>, as well as the <code>&#x3C;head></code> of your site's main index page. Depending on how your site generator is set up, this may mean you need to add it to the default template, or to a \"partial\" or \"include\" template. If you can find where the site stylesheet is linked, that's probably the right place. Alternatively, you can include the script in your site using Netlify's <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/inject-analytics-snippets/\">Script Injection</a> feature.</p>\n<p>When a user logs in with the Netlify Identity widget, an access token directs to the site homepage. In order to complete the login and get back to the CMS, redirect the user back to the <code>/admin/</code> path. To do this, add the following script before the closing <code>body</code> tag of your site's main index page:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;script>\n  if (window.netlifyIdentity) {\n    window.netlifyIdentity.on(\"init\", user => {\n      if (!user) {\n        window.netlifyIdentity.on(\"login\", () => {\n          document.location.href = \"/admin/\";\n        });\n      }\n    });\n  }\n&#x3C;/script>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: This example script requires modern JavaScript and does not work on IE11. For legacy browser support, use function expressions (<code>function () {}</code>) in place of the arrow functions (<code>() => {}</code>), or use a transpiler such as <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#accessing-the-cms\"></a>Accessing the CMS</h2>\n<p>Your site CMS is now fully configured and ready for login!</p>\n<p>If you set your registration preference to \"Invite only,\" invite yourself (and anyone else you choose) as a site user. To do this, select the <strong>Identity</strong> tab from your site dashboard, and then select the <strong>Invite users</strong> button. Invited users receive an email invitation with a confirmation link. Clicking the link will take you to your site with a login prompt.</p>\n<p>If you left your site registration open, or for return visits after confirming an email invitation, access your site's CMS at <code>yoursite.com/admin/</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> No matter where you access Netlify CMS — whether running locally, in a staging environment, or in your published site — it always fetches and commits files in your hosted repository (for example, on GitHub), on the branch you configured in your Netlify CMS config.yml file. This means that content fetched in the admin UI matches the content in the repository, which may be different from your locally running site. It also means that content saved using the admin UI saves directly to the hosted repository, even if you're running the UI locally or in staging.</p>\n<p>Happy posting!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/\">Source</a></p>"},{"url":"/blog/python-for-js-dev/","relativePath":"blog/python-for-js-dev.md","relativeDir":"blog","base":"python-for-js-dev.md","name":"python-for-js-dev","frontmatter":{"title":"Python Resources","date":"2021-06-03","image":"images/python.png","seo":{"title":"python","description":"Commodo ante vis placerat interdum massa massa primis","extra":[{"name":"og:type","value":"article","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:title","value":"python","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:description","value":"Commodo ante vis placerat interdum massa massa primis","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:image","value":"images/python.png","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":true},{"name":"twitter:card","value":"summary_large_image"},{"name":"twitter:title","value":"python"},{"name":"twitter:description","value":"Commodo ante vis placerat interdum massa massa primis"},{"name":"twitter:image","value":"images/python.png","relativeUrl":true}]},"template":"post","thumb_image":"images/superb-triceratops.jpg","thumb_image_alt":"python logo"},"html":"<h1>Python Study Guide for a JavaScript Programmer\n</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1970/1*3V9VOfPk_hrFdbEAd3j-QQ.png\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/52/0*eC4EvZcv6hhH88jX.png?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/647/0*eC4EvZcv6hhH88jX.png\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Ez_1PZ93N4FfvkRr.png?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/608/0*Ez_1PZ93N4FfvkRr.png\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*eE3E5H0AoqkhqK1z.png?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1648/0*eE3E5H0AoqkhqK1z.png\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*Q0CMqFd4PozLDFPB.png?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1638/0*Q0CMqFd4PozLDFPB.png\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3216/0*HQpndNhm1Z_xSoHb.png\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*qHzGRLTOMTf30miT.png?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1614/0*qHzGRLTOMTf30miT.png\">[</p>\n<p>](<a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\">https://github.com/bgoonz</a>)</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://py-prac-42.netlify.app/\" width=\"100%\" height=\"1200px\"><iframe>\n<h1>Applications of Tutorial &#x26; Cheat Sheet Respectivley (At Bottom Of Tutorial):</h1>\n<h1>Basics</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PEP8</strong> : Python Enhancement Proposals, style-guide for Python.</li>\n<li>print is the equivalent of console.log.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'print() == console.log()'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1># is used to make comments in your code.</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Python has a built in help function that let's you see a description of the source code without having to navigate to it… \"-SickNasty … Autor Unknown\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Numbers</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Python has three types of numbers:</li>\n<li><strong>Integer</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Positive and Negative Counting Numbers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>No Decimal Point</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Created by a literal non-decimal point number … <strong>or</strong> … with the <em>int()</em> constructor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>3.

Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>\n<li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>\n<li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Installing Python:</h3>\n<h3>Windows</h3>\n<p>To determine if your Windows computer already has Python 3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a command prompt by entering command prompt in the Windows 10 search box and selecting the Command Prompt App in the Best match section of the results.</li>\n<li>Enter the following command and then select the Enter key:</li>\n<li>ConsoleCopy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>python --version</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Running python --version may not return a value, or may return an error message stating <em>'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</em> This indicates Python is not installed on your Windows system.</li>\n<li>If you see the word Python with a set of numbers separated by . characters, some version of Python is installed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>i.e.</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Python 3.8.0</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>As long as the first number is 3</strong>, you have Python 3 installed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Download Page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/\">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Download Link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.5/python-3.9.5-amd64.exe\">https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.5/python-3.9.5-amd64.exe</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Install Jupyter Notebooks:</h3>\n<h3>pip</h3>\n<p>If you use pip, you can install it with:</p>\n<p>If installing using pip install --user, you must add the user-level bin directory to your PATH environment variable in order to launch jupyter lab. If you are using a Unix derivative (FreeBSD, GNU / Linux, OS X), you can achieve this by using export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\" command.</p>\n<h3>pipenv</h3>\n<p>If you use pipenv, you can install it as:</p>\n<p>or from a git checkout:</p>\n<p>When using pipenv, in order to launch jupyter lab, you must activate the project's virtualenv. For example, in the directory where pipenv's Pipfile and Pipfile.lock live (i.e., where you ran the above commands):</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can run jupyter lab inside the virtualenv with</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bgoonz/Jupyter-Notebooks/tree/master/\">Jupyter Notebook Viewer</a></p>\n<h3>Python Syntax</h3>\n<p>Python syntax was made for readability, and easy editing. For example, the python language uses a : and indented code, while javascript and others generally use {} and indented code.</p>\n<h3>First Program</h3>\n<p>Lets create a <a href=\"https://repl.it/languages/python3\">python 3</a> repl, and call it <em>Hello World</em>. Now you have a blank file called <em>main.py</em>. Now let us write our first line of code:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first \"Hello, World!\" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, press the run button, which obviously runs the code. If you are not using replit, this will not work. You should research how to run a file with your text editor.</p>\n<h3>Command Line</h3>\n<p>If you look to your left at the console where hello world was just printed, you can see a >, >>>, or $ depending on what you are using. After the prompt, try typing a line of code.</p>\n<p>The command line allows you to execute single lines of code at a time. It is often used when trying out a new function or method in the language.</p>\n<h3>New: Comments!</h3>\n<p>Another cool thing that you can generally do with all languages, are comments. In python, a comment starts with a #. The computer ignores all text starting after the #.</p>\n<p># Write some comments!</p>\n<p>If you have a huge comment, do <strong>not</strong> comment all the 350 lines, just put ''' before it, and ''' at the end. Technically, this is not a comment but a string, but the computer still ignores it, so we will use it.</p>\n<h3>New: Variables!</h3>\n<p>Unlike many other languages, there is no var, let, or const to declare a variable in python. You simply go name = 'value'.</p>\n<p>Remember, there is a difference between integers and strings. <em>Remember: String = \"\".</em> To convert between these two, you can put an int in a str() function, and a string in a int() function. There is also a less used one, called a float. Mainly, these are integers with decimals. Change them using the float() command.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://repl.it/@bgoonz/second-scr?lite=true&#x26;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbryanguner.medium.com\">https://repl.it/@bgoonz/second-scr?lite=true&#x26;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbryanguner.medium.com</a></p>\n<p>Instead of using the , in the print function, you can put a + to combine the variables and string.</p>\n<h3>Operators</h3>\n<p>There are many operators in python:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>+</li>\n<li>-</li>\n<li>/</li>\n<li>*\nThese operators are the same in most languages, and allow for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplicaiton.\nNow, we can look at a few more complicated ones:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>simpleops.py</em></p>\n<p>You should already know everything shown above, as it is similar to other languages. If you continue down, you will see more complicated ones.</p>\n<p><em>complexop.py</em></p>\n<p>The ones above are to edit the current value of the variable.\nSorry to JS users, as there is no i++; or anything.</p>\n<h3><em>Fun Fact:\nThe python language was named after Monty Python.</em></h3>\n<p>If you really want to know about the others, view <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm\">Py Operators</a></p>\n<h3>More Things With Strings</h3>\n<p>Like the title?\nAnyways, a ' and a \" both indicate a string, but <strong>do not combine them!</strong></p>\n<p><em>quotes.py</em></p>\n<p><em>slicing.py</em></p>\n<h3>String Slicing</h3>\n<p>You can look at only certain parts of the string by slicing it, using [num:num].\nThe first number stands for how far in you go from the front, and the second stands for how far in you go from the back.</p>\n<h3>Methods and Functions</h3>\n<p>Here is a list of functions/methods we will go over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.strip()</li>\n<li>len()</li>\n<li>.lower()</li>\n<li>.upper()</li>\n<li>.replace()</li>\n<li>.split()</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New: Input()</h3>\n<p>Input is a function that gathers input entered from the user in the command line. It takes one optional parameter, which is the users prompt.</p>\n<p><em>inp.py</em></p>\n<p>If you wanted to make it smaller, and look neater to the user, you could do…</p>\n<p><em>inp2.py</em></p>\n<p>Running:\n<em>inp.py</em></p>\n<p><em>inp2.py</em></p>\n<h3>New: Importing Modules</h3>\n<p>Python has created a lot of functions that are located in other .py files. You need to import these <strong>modules</strong> to gain access to the,, You may wonder why python did this. The purpose of separate modules is to make python faster. Instead of storing millions and millions of functions, , it only needs a few basic ones. To import a module, you must write input &#x3C;modulename>. Do not add the .py extension to the file name. In this example , we will be using a python created module named random.</p>\n<p><em>module.py</em></p>\n<p>Now, I have access to all functions in the random.py file. To access a specific function in the module, you would do &#x3C;module>.&#x3C;function>. For example:</p>\n<p><em>module2.py</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>*Pro Tip:\nDo from random import randint to not have to do random.randint(), just randint()\nTo import all functions from a module, you could do from random import **</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>New: Loops!</h3>\n<p>Loops allow you to repeat code over and over again. This is useful if you want to print Hi with a delay of one second 100 times.</p>\n<h4>for Loop</h4>\n<p>The for loop goes through a list of variables, making a seperate variable equal one of the list every time.\nLet's say we wanted to create the example above.</p>\n<p><em>loop.py</em></p>\n<p>This will print Hello with a .3 second delay 100 times. This is just one way to use it, but it is usually used like this:</p>\n<p><em>loop2.py</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1539649280875_37d22e6d49e8e8fbc453631def345387.pn\">https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1539649280875_37d22e6d49e8e8fbc453631def345387.pn</a></p>\n<h4>while Loop</h4>\n<p>The while loop runs the code while something stays true. You would put while &#x3C;expression>. Every time the loop runs, it evaluates if the expression is True. It it is, it runs the code, if not it continues outside of the loop. For example:</p>\n<p><em>while.py</em></p>\n<p>Or you could do:</p>\n<p><em>while2.py</em></p>\n<h3>New: if Statement</h3>\n<p>The if statement allows you to check if something is True. If so, it runs the code, if not, it continues on. It is kind of like a while loop, but it executes <strong>only once</strong>. An if statement is written:</p>\n<p><em>if.py</em></p>\n<p>Now, you may think that it would be better if you could make it print only one message. Not as many that are True. You can do that with an elif statement:</p>\n<p><em>elif.py</em></p>\n<p>Now, you may wonder how to run code if none work. Well, there is a simple statement called else:</p>\n<p><em>else.py</em></p>\n<h3>New: Functions (def)</h3>\n<p>So far, you have only seen how to use functions other people have made. Let use the example that you want to print the a random number between 1 and 9, and print different text every time.\nIt is quite tiring to type:</p>\n<p>Characters: 389</p>\n<p><em>nofunc.py</em></p>\n<p>Now with functions, you can seriously lower the amount of characters:</p>\n<p>Characters: 254</p>\n<p><em>functions.py</em></p>\n<h3>Project Based Learning:</h3>\n<p>The following is a modified version of a tutorial posted By: <a href=\"https://replit.com/@InvisibleOne\">InvisibleOne </a></p>\n<p>I would cite the original tutorial it's self but at the time of this writing I can no longer find it on his repl.it profile and so the only reference I have are my own notes from following the tutorial when I first found it.</p>\n<h3>1. Adventure Story</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need with an adventure story is a great storyline, something that is exciting and fun. The idea is, that at each pivotal point in the story, you give the player the opportunity to make a choice.\nFirst things first, let's import the stuff that we need, like this:</p>\n<p>Now, we need some variables to hold some of the player data.</p>\n<p>Ok, now we have the player's name and nickname, let's welcome them to the game</p>\n<p>Now for the story. The most important part of all stories is the introduction, so let's print our introduction</p>\n<p>Now, we'll give the player their first choice</p>\n<p>There you have it, a pretty simple choose your own ending story. You can make it as complex or uncomplex as you like.</p>\n<h3>2. TEXT ENCODER</h3>\n<p>Ever make secret messages as a kid? I used to. Anyways, here's the way you can make a program to encode messages! It's pretty simple. First things first, let's get the message the user wants to encode, we'll use input() for that:</p>\n<p>Now we need to split that string into a list of characters, this part is a bit more complicated.</p>\n<p>Now we need to convert the characters into code, well do this with a for loop:</p>\n<p>Once we've encoded the text, we'll print it back for the user</p>\n<p>And if you want to decode something, it is this same process but in reverse!</p>\n<h3>3. Guess my Number</h3>\n<p>Number guessing games are fun and pretty simple, all you need are a few loops. To start, we need to import random.</p>\n<p>That is pretty simple. Now we'll make a list with the numbers were want available for the game</p>\n<p>Next, we get a random number from the list</p>\n<p>Now, we need to ask the user for input, we'll to this with a while loop</p>\n<p>Have fun with this!</p>\n<h3>4. Notes</h3>\n<p>Here is a more advanced project, but still pretty easy. This will be using a txt file to save some notes. The first thing we need to do is to create a txt file in your repl, name it 'notes.txt'\nNow, to open a file in python we use open('filename', type) The type can be 'r' for read, or 'w' for write. There is another option, but we won't be using that here. Now, the first thing we are going to do is get what the user would like to save:</p>\n<p>Now we'll open our file and save that text</p>\n<p>There we go, now the information is in the file. Next, we'll retrieve it</p>\n<p>There we go, that's how you can open files and close files with python</p>\n<h3>5. Random Dare Generator</h3>\n<p>Who doesn't love a good dare? Here is a program that can generate random dares. The first thing we'll need to do is as always, import random. Then we'll make some lists of dares</p>"},{"url":"/blog/web-dev-trends/","relativePath":"blog/web-dev-trends.md","relativeDir":"blog","base":"web-dev-trends.md","name":"web-dev-trends","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Development Tools","subtitle":"In 2021","date":"2021-09-30","thumb_image_alt":"lorem-ipsum","excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"post","thumb_image":"images/webdev.png"},"html":"<p><strong>1.

Working through the examples in this guide, you will learn all the tips and tricks you need to become a pro at gathering any data you need with Node.js!</p>\n<p>We will be gathering a list of all the names and birthdays of U.S. presidents from Wikipedia and the titles of all the posts on the front page of Reddit.</p>\n<p>First things first: Let's install the libraries we'll be using in this guide (Puppeteer will take a while to install as it needs to download Chromium as well).</p>\n<h3>Making your first request</h3>\n<table data-tab-size=\"8\" data-paste-markdown-skip=\"\"><tbody><tr><td id=\"file-install-libraries-L1\" data-line-number=\"1\"></td><td id=\"file-install-libraries-LC1\">npm install --save request request-promise cheerio puppeteer</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Next, let's open a new text file (name the file potusScraper.js), and write a quick function to get the HTML of the Wikipedia \"List of Presidents\" page.</p>\n<table data-tab-size=\"8\" data-paste-markdown-skip=\"\"><tbody><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L1\" data-line-number=\"1\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC1\">const rp = require('request-promise');</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L2\" data-line-number=\"2\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC2\">const url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States';</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L3\" data-line-number=\"3\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC3\"></td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L4\" data-line-number=\"4\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC4\">rp(url)</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L5\" data-line-number=\"5\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC5\">.then(function(html){</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L6\" data-line-number=\"6\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC6\">//success!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L7\" data-line-number=\"7\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC7\">console.log(html);</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L8\" data-line-number=\"8\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC8\">})</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L9\" data-line-number=\"9\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC9\">.catch(function(err){</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L10\" data-line-number=\"10\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC10\">//handle error</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-L11\" data-line-number=\"11\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-LC11\">});</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Output:</p>\n<table data-tab-size=\"8\" data-paste-markdown-skip=\"\"><tbody><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-L1\" data-line-number=\"1\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-LC1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-L2\" data-line-number=\"2\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-LC2\">&lt;html class=\"client-nojs\" lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-L3\" data-line-number=\"3\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-LC3\">&lt;head&gt;</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-L4\" data-line-number=\"4\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-LC4\">&lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"/&gt;</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-L5\" data-line-number=\"5\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-LC5\">&lt;title&gt;List of Presidents of the United States - Wikipedia&lt;/title&gt;</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-L6\" data-line-number=\"6\"></td><td id=\"file-potusscraper-js-v1-output-LC6\">...</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3>Using Chrome DevTools</h3>\n<p>Cool, we got the raw HTML from the web page! But now we need to make sense of this giant blob of text. To do that, we'll need to use Chrome DevTools to allow us to easily search through the HTML of a web page.</p>\n<p>Using Chrome DevTools is easy: simply open Google Chrome, and right click on the element you would like to scrape (in this case I am right clicking on George Washington, because we want to get links to all of the individual presidents' Wikipedia pages):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*gLKhu_EO-cDqYna1P9WL_w.png\"></p>\n<p>Now, simply click inspect, and Chrome will bring up its DevTools pane, allowing you to easily inspect the page's source HTML.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*HSUjFgji22vjwvGi2uZe1A.png\"></p>\n<h3>Parsing HTML with Cheerio.js</h3>\n<p>Awesome, Chrome DevTools is now showing us the exact pattern we should be looking for in the code (a \"big\" tag with a hyperlink inside of it).

A list of the names and birthdays of all 45 U.S. presidents. Using just the request-promise module and Cheerio.js should allow you to scrape the vast majority of sites on the internet.</p>\n<p>Recently, however, many sites have begun using JavaScript to generate dynamic content on their websites. This causes a problem for request-promise and other similar HTTP request libraries (such as axios and fetch), because they only get the response from the initial request, but they cannot execute the JavaScript the way a web browser can.</p>\n<p>Thus, to scrape sites that require JavaScript execution, we need another solution. In our next example, we will get the titles for all of the posts on the front page of Reddit. Let's see what happens when we try to use request-promise as we did in the previous example.</p>\n<p>Output:</p>\n<table data-tab-size=\"8\" data-paste-markdown-skip=\"\"><tbody><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L1\" data-line-number=\"1\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC1\">const rp = require('request-promise');</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L2\" data-line-number=\"2\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC2\">const url = 'https://www.reddit.com';</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L3\" data-line-number=\"3\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC3\"></td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L4\" data-line-number=\"4\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC4\">rp(url)</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L5\" data-line-number=\"5\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC5\">.then(function(html){</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L6\" data-line-number=\"6\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC6\">//success!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L7\" data-line-number=\"7\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC7\">console.log(html);</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L8\" data-line-number=\"8\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC8\">})</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L9\" data-line-number=\"9\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC9\">.catch(function(err){</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L10\" data-line-number=\"10\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC10\">//handle error</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L11\" data-line-number=\"11\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC11\">});</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L12\" data-line-number=\"12\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC12\">}</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Here's what the output looks like:</p>\n<table data-tab-size=\"8\" data-paste-markdown-skip=\"\"><tbody><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-L1\" data-line-number=\"1\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-LC1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-L2\" data-line-number=\"2\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-LC2\">lang=\"en\"&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;reddit: the front page of the</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-L3\" data-line-number=\"3\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-LC3\">internet&lt;/title&gt;</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-L4\" data-line-number=\"4\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-LC4\">...</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*mKzPVGRR4CFKMwQw5y_YnQ.png\"></p>\n<p>Hmmm…not quite what we want.

Here's a few catorizations I think are worth distinguishing for one and other.</h4>\n<h3>1. Interpersonal Connections</h3>\n<p>Seek to leverage the connections you have with people you know and companies you want to work with. I know that that's a violation of the premise of this article but without even feeling the need to provide quantitative proof; I can confidently assume that this is the most <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">RO</a>I efficient way to produce a desirable result. (Sorry introverts… 2020 may have been your year but this is our world. 😘)</p>\n<p><strong>If personal connections don't come through, the next best thing is cold outreach (<em>best in terms of results…. personally I hate cold calling strangers and I am an extrovert</em>.)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"2139\">Before or after submitting an application, <strong>identify 1–3 professionals to reach out to</strong> at the company to express interest in opportunities.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"fb8b\"><strong>Send a message to express interest and request an informational interview</strong> with the individual via LinkedIn, email, Twitter, or other available communication methods.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"840d\"><strong>If you hear back</strong> and the individual is willing to connect, <strong>confirm a day and time to conduct a preliminary interview.</strong> <em>OR</em> <strong>If you have yet to hear back after 3 business days, follow-up.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you send off a message in step two, there are a variety of responses you may receive. Sometimes an individual will forward you along to someone who may be of better assistance, other times your message may be overlooked with no reply, and its possible (best case scenario) your request for a chat becomes an invitation to interview.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3_3Cb73SQM_YazWGpZWtIw.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*aI1PfkSpsUks598LAJvKoQ.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*5eObFD9fV2fe5DztitZfsA.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>### ***2. LinkedIn***.\n<p>I am going to devote a lot of time to this one because it is the largest and most active of all the job board ecosystems… period… full stop regardless of your industry.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn now has <a href=\"https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#Statistics\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">almost 740 million members</a> with over 55 million registered companies. (for comparison 12.3 million people visited Indeed in October, up 19.6 percent. <a href=\"http://www.monster.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Monster.com</a> attracted 12.1 million people, and <a href=\"http://www.careerbuilder.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">CareerBuilder.com</a>attractedd 11.3 million in that same time) and LinkedIn is the most-used social media platform amongst Fortune 500 companies as it provides far more networking capabilities than pure recruitment.</p>\n<p>If you put your resume and skills on LinkedIn.com as a software Engineer, and state that you are open to new opportunities, you <em>will</em> be contacted by multiple recruiters, and if your skills are desirable possibly also directly by companies seeking to hire you. It's a developer's market; there's not enough people out there, especially in America.</p>\n<p>Here's my profile… feel free to connect… the larger your network the greater your exposure is to someone who works at your potential dream job.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guner-046199128/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guner-046199128/\"><strong>Bryan Guner - Web Developer - Freelance | LinkedIn</strong><br />\n<em>View Bryan Guner's profile on LinkedIn, the world's largest professional community.

Your jobs teach you so much about an organization and the business.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow business owners and senior managers, successful team leaders in large organizations, startup owners. You would be surprised how willing some otherwise busy executives are to rub elbows with veritable newcomers. They're not just doing this out of the kindness of their hearts, just like you… they have an ulterior motive. They are hoping to build goodwill with the incoming workforce in a bid to make their company more attractive to high quality candidates. If they give you any of their time…treat it like an interview.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>To leverage this information, (the trick is to constantly remind yourself to be on your game with speaking with them.) I do not care what your teacher's past have said… mark my words…</em> <strong>*THERE IS MOST CERTAINLY SUCH A THING AS A STUPID QUESTION**</strong>…Anyone who tells you otherwise is either stupid themselves or just overcome with their own compassion (an admirable trait but ultimately a disservice to you the competitive job seeker).*</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-surprising-power-of-questions\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-surprising-power-of-questions\"><strong>How to Ask Great Questions</strong><br />\n<em>In Brief The Problem Some professionals such as litigators, journalists and even doctors, are taught to ask questions…</em>hbr.org</a><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/05/the-surprising-power-of-questions\" class=\"js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock\"></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Engage in networking. I would recommend <strong>finding and connecting with current attendee of any software development bootcamp</strong>. They're all (for the most part) programatically encouraged to connect network and engage in peer skill promotion (even if they have no idea of you skill level). If that weren't enough reason, all of them come from a cohort of other individuals being instructed to do the same. Once you have a few in your network other's will seek you out through Linkedin recommendations algorithm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note to prospective employers please just skip the next few sentences and don't ask why…😅</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Of the 214 people that vouched for me… I guestimate about only 80 actually know me in any respectable capacity, and of those, only probably 30 or so are familiar with my competency in the skills they endorsed. It all boils down to the strategies that bootcamps instill in their students. It's the polar opposite of a zero sum game and they're more than happy to exchange personal recommendations with you. They're also far more driven to consistently engage with other members of the linkedin ecosystem because they need to a network to help compensate for their lack of a four year degree and the connections you make in that time.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*E519LWHx8W3CXw6c5FXgqg.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*AUDMmyZrugM3SSy_0axgfQ.jpeg\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Build your personal brand.

I hope it goes without saying… but as a rule avoid signaling to prospective employers the depths of your laziness by using any stock responses LinkedIn provides you.</p>\n<h4>Don't Go Ham On Keyword Placment</h4>\n<p>Placing keywords strategically into your LinkedIn profile is virtually the only way to ensure being flagged by search algorithms as a potential candidate.You could be forgiven for being tempted to heed the advice of your inner lizard brain, and just stuffing your profile with buzzwords but this will likely trigger a spam account checker and result in worse outcomes than the absence of said keywords.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3_3Cb73SQM_YazWGpZWtIw.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*aI1PfkSpsUks598LAJvKoQ.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>\n<hr>\n<h3>Why it matters<em>¿</em></h3>\n<h4>Are We Really All Connected by Just Six Degrees of Separation?</h4>\n<p>Most of us are familiar with the concept of six degrees of separation — the idea is that anyone in the planet can be connected to anyone else in just six steps. So through just five other people, you're effectively connected to the Queen of England, Jim Belushi or even yo mamma.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Back to the other Job Board Niches:</h3>\n<p><strong><em>3. Traditional job boards</em></strong>. Dice.com, Monster.com, etc. They will not find you great jobs at technology companies; they may find you openings as a software engineer at other types of more traditional companies (for example, banks, retail chains, etc though.</p>\n<p><strong><em>4. Local-focused sites</em></strong>. The biggest is Craigslist, but there are others. Often great for contract work and opportunities you wouldn't have otherwise come across.</p>\n<p><strong><em>5. Freelancer websites</em></strong>. oDesk.com, Elance.com, etc. Lower pay, but 100% contract work, and has a lot of flexible opportunities if you're not looking for traditional full-time employment or remote work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"1350\"><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-job-boards-for-software-engineers\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\">Source</a></span></li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3_3Cb73SQM_YazWGpZWtIw.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*aI1PfkSpsUks598LAJvKoQ.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>\n<h3>Lastly Here's A Github Profile Guide:</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0nYkgla6oc0uImSZJElpdw.jpeg\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wIhqnhU5zoyIr1GwZ2UTNA.jpeg\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>Medium is causing strange formatting… they normally form a grid!\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-ypWlmloBF6kz9UnVG2kOA.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Y9SdKz9cS3FtjlKaRge3jg.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>### Rubric:\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*5-FYxWj0q8sUvpDoAR3ZLA.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>\n<hr>\n<h3>Discover More:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/\"><strong>Web-Dev-Hub</strong><br />\n<em>Memoization, Tabulation, and Sorting Algorithms by Example Why is looking at runtime not a reliable method of…</em>bgoonz-blog.netlify.app</a><a href=\"https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/\" class=\"js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock\"></a></p>\n<h1><strong>General</strong></h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://haseebq.com/how-to-break-into-tech-job-hunting-and-interviews/\">How To Break Into Tech -

There were feature updates in this release that customers have planned marketing campaigns around. It also included a bug fix for one customer that's currently having to maintain a very manual workaround. What do you do?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10:24:40 From Alexis Kozak to Everyone : Scenario 2</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>An application has been configured to send an email every time a patient requests a changed email. The automated email sends something to the old email, acknowledging that they changed their email, and if that isn't right, to please contact Secular Health Network. When you come into the office one morning, you see that thousands of emails have been generated in the space of two hours. What do you do? How do you find the number of emails sent?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>10:28:11 From Alexis Kozak to Everyone : Scenario 3</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A customer has requested a change to SSO logic such that only users from a certain region can access SmartExam. You've implemented the rule on their demo environments and given them a testing plan that is simple and straightforward. During testing, you're included in multiple email chains with different parties, as well as some one-off calls and texts messages. Resources seem scattered, but the testing happens. After receiving confirmation from the customer that testing was successful, you're told the code is good to go into production. However, upon doing some quick checks, you discover that the rule you wrote doesn't work and would actually prevent any user from logging into SmartExam. The fix is quite simple.

//=> 1\nconsole.log(counter()); //=> 2\n// so the closure here comes into play because\n// an inner function is accessing and changing\n// a variable from an outer function\n\n// the closure is the combination of the counter\n// function and the all the variables that existed\n// in the scope that it was declared in. because\n// inner blocks/functions have access to outer\n// scopes, that includes the scope of the outer\n// function.\n\n// so counter variable is a closure, in that\n// it contains the inner count value that was\n// initialized by the outer createCounter() function\n// count has been captured or closed over\n\n// this state is private, so if i run createCounter again\n// i get a totally separate count that doesn't interact\n// with the previous one and each of the new functions\n// will have their own internal state based on the\n// initial declaration in the now-closed outer function\n\nlet counter2 = createCounter();\nconsole.log(counter2());

JavaScript developers are not familiar with this concept, much less than C, C++ or Go developers (or any programmer that uses a system programming language), which interact with memory every day.</p>\n<p>It represents a fixed-size chunk of memory (can't be resized) allocated outside of the V8 JavaScript engine.</p>\n<p>You can think of a buffer like an array of integers, which each represent a byte of data.</p>\n<p>It is implemented by the Node.js <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html\">Buffer class</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why do we need a buffer?</h2>\n<p>Buffers were introduced to help developers deal with binary data, in an ecosystem that traditionally only dealt with strings rather than binaries.</p>\n<p>Buffers are deeply linked with streams. When a stream processor receives data faster than it can digest, it puts the data in a buffer.</p>\n<p>A simple visualization of a buffer is when you are watching a YouTube video and the red line goes beyond your visualization point: you are downloading data faster than you're viewing it, and your browser buffers it.</p>\n<h2>How to create a buffer</h2>\n<p>A buffer is created using the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer_from_buffer_alloc_and_buffer_allocunsafe\"><code>Buffer.from()</code></a>, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_alloc_size_fill_encoding\"><code>Buffer.alloc()</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_allocunsafe_size\"><code>Buffer.allocUnsafe()</code></a> methods.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_array\"><code>Buffer.from(array)</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_arraybuffer_byteoffset_length\"><code>Buffer.from(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset[, length]])</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_buffer\"><code>Buffer.from(buffer)</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_string_encoding\"><code>Buffer.from(string[, encoding])</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also just initialize the buffer passing the size. This creates a 1KB buffer:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.alloc(1024);\n//or\nconst buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(1024);\n</code></pre>\n<p>While both <code>alloc</code> and <code>allocUnsafe</code> allocate a <code>Buffer</code> of the specified size in bytes, the <code>Buffer</code> created by <code>alloc</code> will be <em>initialized</em> with zeroes and the one created by <code>allocUnsafe</code> will be <em>uninitialized</em>. This means that while <code>allocUnsafe</code> would be quite fast in comparison to <code>alloc</code>, the allocated segment of memory may contain old data which could potentially be sensitive.</p>\n<p>Older data, if present in the memory, can be accessed or leaked when the <code>Buffer</code> memory is read. This is what really makes <code>allocUnsafe</code> unsafe and extra care must be taken while using it.</p>\n<h2>Using a buffer</h2>\n<h3>Access the content of a buffer</h3>\n<p>A buffer, being an array of bytes, can be accessed like an array:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nconsole.log(buf[0]); //72\nconsole.log(buf[1]); //101\nconsole.log(buf[2]); //121\n</code></pre>\n<p>Those numbers are the Unicode Code that identifies the character in the buffer position (H => 72, e => 101, y => 121)</p>\n<p>You can print the full content of the buffer using the <code>toString()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">console.log(buf.toString());\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notice that if you initialize a buffer with a number that sets its size, you'll get access to pre-initialized memory that will contain random data, not an empty buffer!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Get the length of a buffer</h3>\n<p>Use the <code>length</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nconsole.log(buf.length);\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Iterate over the contents of a buffer</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nfor (const item of buf) {\n    console.log(item); //72 101 121 33\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Changing the content of a buffer</h3>\n<p>You can write to a buffer a whole string of data by using the <code>write()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.alloc(4);\nbuf.write('Hey!');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just like you can access a buffer with an array syntax, you can also set the contents of the buffer in the same way:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nbuf[1] = 111; //o\nconsole.log(buf.toString()); //Hoy!\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Copy a buffer</h3>\n<p>Copying a buffer is possible using the <code>copy()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nlet bufcopy = Buffer.alloc(4); //allocate 4 bytes\nbuf.copy(bufcopy);\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default you copy the whole buffer. 3 more parameters let you define the starting position, the ending position, and the new buffer length:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nlet bufcopy = Buffer.alloc(2); //allocate 2 bytes\nbuf.copy(bufcopy, 0, 0, 2);\nbufcopy.toString(); //'He'\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Slice a buffer</h3>\n<p>If you want to create a partial visualization of a buffer, you can create a slice. A slice is not a copy: the original buffer is still the source of truth. If that changes, your slice changes.</p>\n<p>Use the <code>slice()</code> method to create it. The first parameter is the starting position, and you can specify an optional second parameter with the end position:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nbuf.slice(0).toString(); //Hey!\nconst slice = buf.slice(0, 2);\nconsole.log(slice.toString()); //He\nbuf[1] = 111; //o\nconsole.log(slice.toString()); //Ho\n</code></pre>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/dev-dep/","relativePath":"docs/articles/dev-dep.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"dev-dep.md","name":"dev-dep","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev Dependencies","sections":[],"seo":{"title":"Dependencies","description":"install an npm package using npm install you are installing it as a dependency.

Because it explains how Node.js can be asynchronous and have non-blocking I/O, and so it explains basically the \"killer app\" of Node.js, the thing that made it this successful.</p>\n<p>The Node.js JavaScript code runs on a single thread. There is just one thing happening at a time.</p>\n<p>This is a limitation that's actually very helpful, as it simplifies a lot how you program without worrying about concurrency issues.</p>\n<p>You just need to pay attention to how you write your code and avoid anything that could block the thread, like synchronous network calls or infinite loops.</p>\n<p>In general, in most browsers there is an event loop for every browser tab, to make every process isolated and avoid a web page with infinite loops or heavy processing to block your entire browser.</p>\n<p>The environment manages multiple concurrent event loops, to handle API calls for example. Web Workers run in their own event loop as well.</p>\n<p>You mainly need to be concerned that <em>your code</em> will run on a single event loop, and write code with this thing in mind to avoid blocking it.</p>\n<h2>Blocking the event loop</h2>\n<p>Any JavaScript code that takes too long to return back control to the event loop will block the execution of any JavaScript code in the page, even block the UI thread, and the user cannot click around, scroll the page, and so on.</p>\n<p>Almost all the I/O primitives in JavaScript are non-blocking. Network requests, filesystem operations, and so on. Being blocking is the exception, and this is why JavaScript is based so much on callbacks, and more recently on promises and async/await.</p>\n<h2>The call stack</h2>\n<p>The call stack is a LIFO queue (Last In, First Out).</p>\n<p>The event loop continuously checks the <strong>call stack</strong> to see if there's any function that needs to run.</p>\n<p>While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack and executes each one in order.</p>\n<p>You know the error stack trace you might be familiar with, in the debugger or in the browser console? The browser looks up the function names in the call stack to inform you which function originates the current call:</p>\n<p><img src=\"exception-call-stack.png\" alt=\"Exception call stack\"></p>\n<h2>A simple event loop explanation</h2>\n<p>Let's pick an example:</p>\n<iframe\n  title=\"A simple event loop explanation\"\n  src=\"https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/nodejs-dev-0029-01?path=server.js&previewSize=20&attributionHidden=true&sidebarCollapsed=true\"\n  alt=\"nodejs-dev-0029-01 on Glitch\"\n  style=\"height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;\">\n</iframe>\n<!--```js\nconst bar = () => console.log('bar')\n\nconst baz = () => console.log('baz')\n\nconst foo = () => {\n  console.log('foo')\n  bar()\n  baz()\n}\n\nfoo()\n```\n\nThis code prints\n\n```txt\nfoo\nbar\nbaz\n```\n\nas expected.-->\n<p>When this code runs, first <code>foo()</code> is called. Inside <code>foo()</code> we first call <code>bar()</code>, then we call <code>baz()</code>.</p>\n<p>At this point the call stack looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"call-stack-first-example.png\" alt=\"Call stack first example\"></p>\n<p>The event loop on every iteration looks if there's something in the call stack, and executes it:</p>\n<p><img src=\"execution-order-first-example.png\" alt=\"Execution order first example\"></p>\n<p>until the call stack is empty.</p>\n<h2>Queuing function execution</h2>\n<p>The above example looks normal, there's nothing special about it: JavaScript finds things to execute, runs them in order.</p>\n<p>Let's see how to defer a function until the stack is clear.</p>\n<p>The use case of <code>setTimeout(() => {}, 0)</code> is to call a function, but execute it once every other function in the code has executed.</p>\n<p>Take this example:</p>\n<iframe\n  title=\"Queuing function execution\"\n  src=\"https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/nodejs-dev-0029-02?path=server.js&previewSize=20&attributionHidden=true&sidebarCollapsed=true\"\n  alt=\"nodejs-dev-0029-02 on Glitch\"\n  style=\"height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;\">\n</iframe>\n<!--```js\nconst bar = () => console.log('bar')\n\nconst baz = () => console.log('baz')\n\nconst foo = () => {\n  console.log('foo')\n  setTimeout(bar, 0)\n  baz()\n}\n\nfoo()\n```-->\n<p>This code prints, maybe surprisingly:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">foo\nbaz\nbar\n</code></pre>\n<p>When this code runs, first foo() is called. Inside foo() we first call setTimeout, passing <code>bar</code> as an argument, and we instruct it to run immediately as fast as it can, passing 0 as the timer. Then we call baz().</p>\n<p>At this point the call stack looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"call-stack-second-example.png\" alt=\"Call stack second example\"></p>\n<p>Here is the execution order for all the functions in our program:</p>\n<p><img src=\"execution-order-second-example.png\" alt=\"Execution order second example\"></p>\n<p>Why is this happening?</p>\n<h2>The Message Queue</h2>\n<p>When setTimeout() is called, the Browser or Node.js starts the timer. Once the timer expires, in this case immediately as we put 0 as the timeout, the callback function is put in the <strong>Message Queue</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Message Queue is also where user-initiated events like click or keyboard events, or fetch responses are queued before your code has the opportunity to react to them. Or also DOM events like <code>onLoad</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>The loop gives priority to the call stack, and it first processes everything it finds in the call stack, and once there's nothing in there, it goes to pick up things in the message queue.</strong></p>\n<p>We don't have to wait for functions like <code>setTimeout</code>, fetch or other things to do their own work, because they are provided by the browser, and they live on their own threads. For example, if you set the <code>setTimeout</code> timeout to 2 seconds, you don't have to wait 2 seconds - the wait happens elsewhere.</p>\n<h2>ES6 Job Queue</h2>\n<p>ECMAScript 2015 introduced the concept of the Job Queue, which is used by Promises (also introduced in ES6/ES2015). It's a way to execute the result of an async function as soon as possible, rather than being put at the end of the call stack.</p>\n<p>Promises that resolve before the current function ends will be executed right after the current function.</p>\n<p>I find nice the analogy of a rollercoaster ride at an amusement park: the message queue puts you at the back of the queue, behind all the other people, where you will have to wait for your turn, while the job queue is the fastpass ticket that lets you take another ride right after you finished the previous one.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<iframe\n  title=\"ECMAScript 2015 Job Queue\"\n  src=\"https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/nodejs-dev-0029-03?path=server.js&previewSize=35&attributionHidden=true&sidebarCollapsed=true\"\n  alt=\"nodejs-dev-0029-03 on Glitch\"\n  style=\"height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;\">\n</iframe>\n<!--```js\nconst bar = () => console.log('bar')\n\nconst baz = () => console.log('baz')\n\nconst foo = () => {\n  console.log('foo')\n  setTimeout(bar, 0)\n  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>\n    resolve('should be right after baz, before bar')\n  ).then(resolve => console.log(resolve))\n  baz()\n}\n\nfoo()\n```\n\nThis prints\n\n```txt\nfoo\nbaz\nshould be right after baz, before bar\nbar\n```-->\n<p>That's a big difference between Promises (and Async/await, which is built on promises) and plain old asynchronous functions through <code>setTimeout()</code> or other platform APIs.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/fs-module/","relativePath":"docs/articles/fs-module.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"fs-module.md","name":"fs-module","frontmatter":{"title":"Fs-Module","sections":[],"seo":{"title":"","description":"Fs-Module","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>The <code>fs</code> module provides a lot of very useful functionality to access and interact with the file system.</p>\n<p>There is no need to install it.

This chapter will look in brief overview at the core technologies that go together to make the World Wide Web.</p>\n<p>We can start by differentiating the Internet and the World Wide Web. These are often confused because the Web is the main use that most people have for the Internet and a common web browser is called \"Internet Explorer\". However, we can properly distinguish between them. The Internet is a collection of inter-connected computers using the TCP/IP protocol to exchange information. The World Wide Web is a particular use of the Internet to exchange HTML web pages (and other documents) using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>\n<p>Let's look briefly at the four basic ingredients of the Web:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TCP/IP - is a low level message protocol that is used to transfer messages between computers on the Internet.</li>\n<li>HTTP - is used by a Web Client to make a request to a Web Server and for the server to return the response.</li>\n<li>URL - is a way of writing down the address of something on the Web so that a browser can work out where to get it from.</li>\n<li>HTML - is a language for writing web pages containing text, images and other content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, these four technologies allow a web client - the web browser on your computer - to fetch pages from a web server anywhere in the world that might contain links to other documents and so on. It's the links between documents that make this a <em>Web</em> and the Internet that allows it to be the <em>World Wide Web</em>.</p>\n<p>Let's look at each of these technologies in a little more detail; although we'll explore most of them a lot more throughout the rest of this book.</p>\n<h2>TCP/IP and DNS</h2>\n<p>TCP/IP, the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is the standard way of exchanging messages on the Internet - in fact it effectively defines what the Internet is: a network of computers communicating via TCP/IP. For our purposes, there's no need to have a deep understanding of the low level details of TCP/IP, though many of you will learn more about it if you study any networking topics. However there are a few higher level things that touch on how we use the Internet in the context of the World Wide Web.</p>\n<p>A <em>Protocol</em> in this sense is a formal standard for how two machines will talk to each other over a communications channel. It describes what messages are allowed and what they mean and how data is transferred over the network. Later, we'll look at HTTP which is a higher level protocol for web requests. TCP/IP deals with the low level exchange of data and doesn't really care what the content of that data is.</p>\n<p>The Internet is a collection of computer networks joined by physical network channels. Within an organisation, there may be a physical network based on the Ethernet standard (wired or wireless) which effectively connects all computers on the network to each other. Organisations connect to each other via DSL or cable connections. These <em>inter</em>-connected <em>net</em>works make up the Internet. The role of TCP/IP is to allow a computer within one organisation (your laptop) to establish a connection to a computer in another (a web server). Importantly, this connection is a <em>point-to-point</em> connection - like a private channel between the two computers, even though the data is carried by this shared network of networks.</p>\n<p>TCP/IP is a <em>packet oriented</em> protocol. To send a message, it is broken up into small chunks (packets) which are each addressed and sent over the network. The receiving computer intercepts these packets, notices that they are addressed to them, and re-assembles the original message. Packets can arrive out of order (or not at all) and TCP/IP defines what the two communicating computers should do in this case.</p>\n<p>Each computer on the network is assigned a unique <em>IP address</em> which is a 32 bit number usually expressed as four 8 bit digits separated by dots. For example 192.168.1.2 or 137.111.158.22. These numbers are used as the addresses of the packets sent around the Internet. Within an organisation, all computers will share the first part of their address; for example, all Macquarie University computers will have addresses starting with 137.111. This means that any packet sent from within Macquarie to an address in the range 137.111.x.x will find it's destination somewhere inside the organisation. However, if we send a packet to 143.119.160.16 (the NSW Government website) the network protocols need to know that this packet should be forwarded to the NSW Government network before it can be delivered. We can pretend that this all happens by magic (this isn't a networking course) and rest assured that a clever <em>network routing</em> algorithm will get the packets to where they need to go. As long as we know the IP address of the destination computer, we can establish a point-to-point channel and send data back and forth.</p>\n<p>Within your home you might have your own private network, often established by a wireless router that connects to your ADSL or cable service. While this router will have a proper IP address, the network it establishes in your home is a <em>private network</em> and will use one of two address ranges: 192.168.x.x or 10.10.x.x. Both of these are reserved for private use, so that my laptop and your printer might have the same IP address of 192.168.100.13. A trick called Network Address Translation (NAT) carried out by your router allows each of these devices to connect to the Internet through the router, even though they don't have a full IP address. Again, we don't need to worry about the details but sometimes it's useful to know how to communicate directly with devices on your own network, in which case you might start finding out about these private IP addresses.</p>\n<p>A significant issue with the success and ubiquity of the Internet is that we might run out of unique addresses. Since an IP address is a 32 bit number, that means there are only 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. If every computer, mobile phone, printer and electricity meter is to be connected to the Internet, the it's clear that more addresses will be needed. There are two responses to this. The first is that many of these devices share a single IP address (using NAT) which multiplies the number available significantly. THe second is a new standard called IPv6 (rather than IPv4 which I've described here) where addresses are 128 bits long. Most modern devices are able to use IPv6 addressing so the crisis is unlikely to hit us catastrophically.</p>\n<p>IP addresses give a unique identifier for each device but they aren't very easy to remember. We're used to giving the names of web-sites via names like www.nsw.gov.au or sales.example.com. These names are translated into numerical IP addresses via the Domain Name System (DNS) which works using a clever hierarchical algorithm. For example, to work out what sales.example.com means our local DNS server would look at the last part of the address and forward the query to a server that it knows is authoritative for all addresses ending in .com. The .com server may not know which IP address corresponds to sales.example.com so it sends the query on to the DNS server for example.com which will respond with the answer. As the result is passed back to the original DNS server, it is cached (remembered) so that it can be returned more quickly the next time it is requested.</p>\n<p>DNS allows an organisation to set up whatever names it needs and link those names to its servers. It's common to have the main web server called www.example.com but the same server could also be referred to as example.com, sales.example.com or test.example.com. We'll see later how this arrangement can be used to provide a lot of flexibility when setting up web servers.</p>\n<h2>HTTP</h2>\n<p>In 1991 Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. He was building on the existing technology of the Internet that allowed computers to exchange information around the world. His invention consisted essentially of three things: the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the Universal Resource Locator (URL) and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTTP is the language that a web client (your browser) talks to a web server to ask for a page and get the response back. It's a protocol, just like TCP/IP, but it's a much higher level protocol and it's one that we need to understand very well as web programmers.</p>\n<p>HTTP requires that we first establish a point-to-point connection between a client (who is sending a request) and a server (who will fulfil the request if possible). This connection is usually via TCP/IP over the Internet but could also be over any other communication medium such as <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/bt-http-server/\">bluetooth</a>. Once the connection is established, the conversation can begin.</p>\n<p>One of the important features of HTTP is that it is a simple, text based protocol. The request and response consist of a number of lines of text in a well defined format. Here is an example request that might be sent to a server:</p>\n<p>The first word in the request is always one of the defined <em>HTTP verbs</em> (most frequently GET, HEAD or POST, we'll explore these in more detail later). A GET request asks the server to return the given resource, in this case '/storefront.html' which is probably an HTML file stored somewhere on the server. The last part of the first line (HTTP/1.1) defines the version of the standard that we are using; there was a version 1.0 but most modern browsers will use 1.1. The remaining lines of the request include other <em>headers</em> that qualify the request in some way. The <em>Host</em> header is required and denotes the server that the request is being sent to. The Accept header defines what kinds of document we'd like in return; in this case, any kind of text document is ok. The request ends with a blank line, which is how the server knows that all headers have been received.</p>\n<p>The request is received and processed by the server and a response is sent back to the client containing the web page that was asked for. Again the format of the response is easy to understand:</p>\n<p>The first word of the response must be HTTP/1.1, the remainder of the first line contains a response code (200) and explanation (OK) in this case saying everything is fine, here's the page you asked for. The second header here defines the type of document being returned (it's an HTML page). There is then a blank line which ends the headers (as with the request) and the HTML content is then sent.</p>\n<p>A real request and response pair will have many more headers than this but their format follows this basic pattern: header lines followed by a blank line and an optional body. The point here is that HTTP is a very simple conversation between web client and server.</p>\n<p>One important feature of HTTP is that each request/response pair is independent of every other. This means that all the information about your request must be included in the request headers; the server doesn't remember anything you told it last time. This is one reason that HTTP and the web have been so successful. It is very easy to implement an HTTP server and it can be done on very small devices. This might be one of the reasons why the Web succeeded where other similar systems failed. Since the protocol is so simple, it was easy to write a web server and many people did. This meant that the web was used by many small groups to publish content, forming the groundswell that led to institutional and corporate adoption.</p>\n<p>We'll look at HTTP in more detail later, for now the take home message is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP is a simple text based protocol</li>\n<li>The client (browser) sends a request to the server</li>\n<li>The server receives the request and returns a response</li>\n<li>The server doesn't need to remember the client - every request is independant.</li>\n<li>The simple nature of HTTP makes it easy to understand and makes writing web servers relatively easy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Uniform Resource Locators: URL</h2>\n<p>Another part of Tim Berners-Lee's invention is the Uniform Resource Locator, URL. These days, URLs are ubiquitous. We see them on advertisments, on the TV, we send them to each other in email, even reference them in books and reports. Most organisations today will have at least one top-level URL for their website and often have many connected to particular services, departments or advertising campaigns.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://pwp.stevecassidy.net/web/urls.html\">the URL chapter</a> for a detaile discussion.</p>\n<h2>Hypertext Markup Language: HTML</h2>\n<p>HTML is the last link in the chain that makes the Web. It is a language that allows authors to write Hypertext documents that include structure and formatting instructions. <em>Hypertext</em> describes the idea of linking one document to another via <em>hyperlinks</em> so that when you activate a link, you jump to a new document. There were hypertext systems before the birth of the web (<a href=\"http://www.xanadu.com/\">Project Xanadu</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard\">Hypercard</a>) but HTML has been much more successful than any other standard in this space.</p>\n<p>HTML is a <em>Markup Language</em> which means that it provides a way of adding additional information or markup to plain text. In this case, the markup defines the structure of the document - headers, paragraphs, lists, tables - as well as the hypertext features - links and anchors. There are other markup languages, for example LaTeX is used to write scientific papers by adding markup to text (e.g. \\textbf{bold text} or \\section{A heading}). All markup languages have some way of differentiating the text in a document from the markup instructions. In HTML this is via the angle brackets which surround tag names: &#x3C;tag>.</p>\n<p>HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee but it derives from an earlier standard called SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language) that had been in use for some years as a language for writing technical documentation. It came out of work by IBM on their technical documentation and became an industry standard ratified by the ISO. SGML is in fact a meta-standard in that it defines a way of defining a markup language. HTML is one such markup language and can strictly be treated as such; however, since HTML is so much more common than any other SGML language, it is usually treated as a special case. So, for example, while we could use general purpose SGML authoring tools to write HTML, we generally use applications tailored to writing web pages that only understand HTML.</p>\n<p>Another related markup language is <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/\">XML</a>, the eXtensible Markup Language. XML began as an attempt to streamline the SGML standard to make it more suitable for the web. Like SGML, XML is a meta-standard that defines how markup languages can be written. There is a version of HTML defined as an XML language called <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/\">XHTML</a> but this never really took off and the standardisation work around it was stopped in 2010. Instead, XML has become widely used to describe <em>data</em> rather than <em>documents</em> and we'll look at how it is used today on the web later in this book.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/http/","relativePath":"docs/articles/http.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"http.md","name":"http","frontmatter":{"title":"The HTTP Protocol","weight":0,"excerpt":"The HTTP Protocol","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>The HTTP Protocol\n\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires: a connection between client and server</li>\n<li>Stateless: no login process, each request is independent</li>\n<li>Simple format: request header, blank line, possible payload</li>\n<li>Symmetrical: allows data to be sent and recieved</li>\n<li>Very easy to implement but scales very well</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Example HTTP Request</h2>\n<p>Note lines folded for display.</p>\n<p>What do each of these headers mean?

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at <a href=\"http://google.stanford.edu/\">http://google.stanford.edu/</a><br>\nTo engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date.<br>\nApart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.</p>\n<p> <strong>Keywords</strong>: World Wide Web, Search Engines, Information Retrieval, PageRank, Google</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>1. Introduction</h2>\n<p><em>(Note: There are two versions of this paper -- a longer full version and a shorter printed version. The full version is available on the web and the conference CD-ROM.)</em><br>\nThe web creates new challenges for information retrieval. The amount of information on the web is growing rapidly, as well as the number of new users inexperienced in the art of web research. People are likely to surf the web using its link graph, often starting with high quality human maintained indices such as <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!</a> or with search engines. Human maintained lists cover popular topics effectively but are subjective, expensive to build and maintain, slow to improve, and cannot cover all esoteric topics. Automated search engines that rely on keyword matching usually return too many low quality matches. To make matters worse, some advertisers attempt to gain people's attention by taking measures meant to mislead automated search engines. We have built a large-scale search engine which addresses many of the problems of existing systems. It makes especially heavy use of the additional structure present in hypertext to provide much higher quality search results. We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.</p>\n<h3>1.1 Web Search Engines -- Scaling Up: 1994 - 2000</h3>\n<p>Search engine technology has had to scale dramatically to keep up with the growth of the web. In 1994, one of the first web search engines, the World Wide Web Worm (WWWW) <a href=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/mypapers/www94.ps\">[McBryan 94]</a> had an index of 110,000 web pages and web accessible documents. As of November, 1997, the top search engines claim to index from 2 million (WebCrawler) to 100 million web documents (from <a href=\"http://www.searchenginewatch.com/\">Search Engine Watch)</a>. It is foreseeable that by the year 2000, a comprehensive index of the Web will contain over a billion documents. At the same time, the number of queries search engines handle has grown incredibly too. In March and April 1994, the World Wide Web Worm received an average of about 1500 queries per day. In November 1997, Altavista claimed it handled roughly 20 million queries per day. With the increasing number of users on the web, and automated systems which query search engines, it is likely that top search engines will handle hundreds of millions of queries per day by the year 2000. The goal of our system is to address many of the problems, both in quality and scalability, introduced by scaling search engine technology to such extraordinary numbers.</p>\n<h3>1.2. Google: Scaling with the Web</h3>\n<p>Creating a search engine which scales even to today's web presents many challenges. Fast crawling technology is needed to gather the web documents and keep them up to date. Storage space must be used efficiently to store indices and, optionally, the documents themselves. The indexing system must process hundreds of gigabytes of data efficiently. Queries must be handled quickly, at a rate of hundreds to thousands per second.</p>\n<p>These tasks are becoming increasingly difficult as the Web grows. However, hardware performance and cost have improved dramatically to partially offset the difficulty. There are, however, several notable exceptions to this progress such as disk seek time and operating system robustness. In designing Google, we have considered both the rate of growth of the Web and technological changes. Google is designed to scale well to extremely large data sets. It makes efficient use of storage space to store the index. Its data structures are optimized for fast and efficient access (see section <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#data\">4.2</a>). Further, we expect that the cost to index and store text or HTML will eventually decline relative to the amount that will be available (see <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#b\">Appendix B</a>). This will result in favorable scaling properties for centralized systems like Google.</p>\n<h3>1.3 Design Goals</h3>\n<h4>1.3.1 Improved Search Quality</h4>\n<p>Our main goal is to improve the quality of web search engines. In 1994, some people believed that a complete search index would make it possible to find anything easily. According to <a href=\"http://botw.org/1994/awards/navigators.html\">Best of the Web 1994 -- Navigators,</a>  \"The best navigation service should make it easy to find almost anything on the Web (once all the data is entered).\"  However, the Web of 1997 is quite different. Anyone who has used a search engine recently, can readily testify that the completeness of the index is not the only factor in the quality of search results. \"Junk results\" often wash out any results that a user is interested in. In fact, as of November 1997, only one of the top four commercial search engines finds itself (returns its own search page in response to its name in the top ten results). One of the main causes of this problem is that the number of documents in the indices has been increasing by many orders of magnitude, but the user's ability to look at documents has not. People are still only willing to look at the first few tens of results. Because of this, as the collection size grows, we need tools that have very high precision (number of relevant documents returned, say in the top tens of results). Indeed, we want our notion of \"relevant\" to only include the very best documents since there may be tens of thousands of slightly relevant documents. This very high precision is important even at the expense of recall (the total number of relevant documents the system is able to return). There is quite a bit of recent optimism that the use of more hypertextual information can help improve search and other applications [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Marchiori 97</a>] [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Spertus 97</a>] [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Weiss 96</a>] [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Kleinberg 98</a>]. In particular, link structure [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Page 98</a>] and link text provide a lot of information for making relevance judgments and quality filtering. Google makes use of both link structure and anchor text (see Sections <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#pr\">2.1</a> and <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#anchor\">2.2</a>).</p>\n<h4>1.3.2 Academic Search Engine Research</h4>\n<p>Aside from tremendous growth, the Web has also become increasingly commercial over time. In 1993, 1.5% of web servers were on .com domains. This number grew to over 60% in 1997. At the same time, search engines have migrated from the academic domain to the commercial. Up until now most search engine development has gone on at companies with little publication of technical details. This causes search engine technology to remain largely a black art and to be advertising oriented (see <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#a\">Appendix A</a>). With Google, we have a strong goal to push more development and understanding into the academic realm.</p>\n<p>Another important design goal was to build systems that reasonable numbers of people can actually use. Usage was important to us because we think some of the most interesting research will involve leveraging the vast amount of usage data that is available from modern web systems. For example, there are many tens of millions of searches performed every day. However, it is very difficult to get this data, mainly because it is considered commercially valuable.</p>\n<p>Our final design goal was to build an architecture that can support novel research activities on large-scale web data. To support novel research uses, Google stores all of the actual documents it crawls in compressed form. One of our main goals in designing Google was to set up an environment where other researchers can come in quickly, process large chunks of the web, and produce interesting results that would have been very difficult to produce otherwise. In the short time the system has been up, there have already been several papers using databases generated by Google, and many others are underway. Another goal we have is to set up a Spacelab-like environment where researchers or even students can propose and do interesting experiments on our large-scale web data.</p>\n<h2>2. System Features</h2>\n<p>The Google search engine has two important features that help it produce high precision results. First, it makes use of the link structure of the Web to calculate a quality ranking for each web page. This ranking is called PageRank and is described in detail in [Page 98]. Second, Google utilizes link to improve search results.</p>\n<h3>2.1 PageRank: Bringing Order to the Web</h3>\n<p>The citation (link) graph of the web is an important resource that has largely gone unused in existing web search engines. We have created maps containing as many as 518 million of these hyperlinks, a significant sample of the total. These maps allow rapid calculation of a web page's \"PageRank\", an objective measure of its citation importance that corresponds well with people's subjective idea of importance. Because of this correspondence, PageRank is an excellent way to prioritize the results of web keyword searches. For most popular subjects, a simple text matching search that is restricted to web page titles performs admirably when PageRank prioritizes the results (demo available at <a href=\"http://google.stanford.edu/\">google.stanford.edu</a>). For the type of full text searches in the main Google system, PageRank also helps a great deal.</p>\n<h4>2.1.1 Description of PageRank Calculation</h4>\n<p>Academic citation literature has been applied to the web, largely by counting citations or backlinks to a given page. This gives some approximation of a page's importance or quality. PageRank extends this idea by not counting links from all pages equally, and by normalizing by the number of links on a page. PageRank is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We assume page A has pages T1...Tn which point to it (i.e., are citations). The parameter d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1. We usually set d to 0.85. There are more details about d in the next section. Also C(A) is defined as the number of links going out of page A. The PageRank of a page A is given as follows:</em></p>\n<p><em>PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))</em></p>\n<p><em>Note that the PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages, so the sum of all web pages' PageRanks will be one.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>PageRank or <em>PR(A)</em> can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm, and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web. Also, a PageRank for 26 million web pages can be computed in a few hours on a medium size workstation. There are many other details which are beyond the scope of this paper.</p>\n<h4>2.1.2 Intuitive Justification</h4>\n<p>PageRank can be thought of as a model of user behavior. We assume there is a \"random surfer\" who is given a web page at random and keeps clicking on links, never hitting \"back\" but eventually gets bored and starts on another random page. The probability that the random surfer visits a page is its PageRank. And, the <em>d</em> damping factor is the probability at each page the \"random surfer\" will get bored and request another random page. One important variation is to only add the damping factor <em>d</em> to a single page, or a group of pages. This allows for personalization and can make it nearly impossible to deliberately mislead the system in order to get a higher ranking. We have several other extensions to PageRank, again see [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Page 98</a>].</p>\n<p>Another intuitive justification is that a page can have a high PageRank if there are many pages that point to it, or if there are some pages that point to it and have a high PageRank. Intuitively, pages that are well cited from many places around the web are worth looking at. Also, pages that have perhaps only one citation from something like the <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!</a> homepage are also generally worth looking at. If a page was not high quality, or was a broken link, it is quite likely that Yahoo's homepage would not link to it. PageRank handles both these cases and everything in between by recursively propagating weights through the link structure of the web.</p>\n<h3>2.2 Anchor Text</h3>\n<p>The text of links is treated in a special way in our search engine. Most search engines associate the text of a link with the page that the link is on. In addition, we associate it with the page the link points to. This has several advantages. First, anchors often provide more accurate descriptions of web pages than the pages themselves. Second, anchors may exist for documents which cannot be indexed by a text-based search engine, such as images, programs, and databases. This makes it possible to return web pages which have not actually been crawled. Note that pages that have not been crawled can cause problems, since they are never checked for validity before being returned to the user. In this case, the search engine can even return a page that never actually existed, but had hyperlinks pointing to it. However, it is possible to sort the results, so that this particular problem rarely happens.</p>\n<p>This idea of propagating anchor text to the page it refers to was implemented in the World Wide Web Worm [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">McBryan 94</a>] especially because it helps search non-text information, and expands the search coverage with fewer downloaded documents. We use anchor propagation mostly because anchor text can help provide better quality results. Using anchor text efficiently is technically difficult because of the large amounts of data which must be processed. In our current crawl of 24 million pages, we had over 259 million anchors which we indexed.</p>\n<h3>2.3 Other Features</h3>\n<p>Aside from PageRank and the use of anchor text, Google has several other features. First, it has location information for all hits and so it makes extensive use of proximity in search. Second, Google keeps track of some visual presentation details such as font size of words. Words in a larger or bolder font are weighted higher than other words. Third, full raw HTML of pages is available in a repository.</p>\n<h2>3 Related Work</h2>\n<p>Search research on the web has a short and concise history. The World Wide Web Worm (WWWW) <a href=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/mypapers/www94.ps\">[McBryan 94]</a> was one of the first web search engines. It was subsequently followed by several other academic search engines, many of which are now public companies. Compared to the growth of the Web and the importance of search engines there are precious few documents about recent search engines [<a href=\"http://info.webcrawler.com/bp/WWW94.html\">Pinkerton 94</a>]. According to Michael Mauldin (chief scientist, Lycos Inc) <a href=\"http://www.computer.org/pubs/expert/1997/trends/x1008/mauldin.htm\">[Mauldin]</a>, \"the various services (including Lycos) closely guard the details of these databases\". However, there has been a fair amount of work on specific features of search engines. Especially well represented is work which can get results by post-processing the results of existing commercial search engines, or produce small scale \"individualized\" search engines. Finally, there has been a lot of research on information retrieval systems, especially on well controlled collections. In the next two sections, we discuss some areas where this research needs to be extended to work better on the web.</p>\n<h3>3.1 Information Retrieval</h3>\n<p>Work in information retrieval systems goes back many years and is well developed [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Witten 94</a>]. However, most of the research on information retrieval systems is on small well controlled homogeneous collections such as collections of scientific papers or news stories on a related topic. Indeed, the primary benchmark for information retrieval, the Text Retrieval Conference [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">TREC 96</a>], uses a fairly small, well controlled collection for their benchmarks. The \"Very Large Corpus\" benchmark is only 20GB compared to the 147GB from our crawl of 24 million web pages. Things that work well on TREC often do not produce good results on the web. For example, the standard vector space model tries to return the document that most closely approximates the query, given that both query and document are vectors defined by their word occurrence. On the web, this strategy often returns very short documents that are the query plus a few words. For example, we have seen a major search engine return a page containing only \"Bill Clinton Sucks\" and picture from a \"Bill Clinton\" query. Some argue that on the web, users should specify more accurately what they want and add more words to their query. We disagree vehemently with this position. If a user issues a query like \"Bill Clinton\" they should get reasonable results since there is a enormous amount of high quality information available on this topic. Given examples like these, we believe that the standard information retrieval work needs to be extended to deal effectively with the web.</p>\n<h3>3.2 Differences Between the Web and Well Controlled Collections</h3>\n<p>The web is a vast collection of completely uncontrolled heterogeneous documents. Documents on the web have extreme variation internal to the documents, and also in the external meta information that might be available. For example, documents differ internally in their language (both human and programming), vocabulary (email addresses, links, zip codes, phone numbers, product numbers), type or format (text, HTML, PDF, images, sounds), and may even be machine generated (log files or output from a database). On the other hand, we define external meta information as information that can be inferred about a document, but is not contained within it. Examples of external meta information include things like reputation of the source, update frequency, quality, popularity or usage, and citations. Not only are the possible sources of external meta information varied, but the things that are being measured vary many orders of magnitude as well. For example, compare the usage information from a major homepage, like Yahoo's which currently receives millions of page views every day with an obscure historical article which might receive one view every ten years. Clearly, these two items must be treated very differently by a search engine.</p>\n<p>Another big difference between the web and traditional well controlled collections is that there is virtually no control over what people can put on the web. Couple this flexibility to publish anything with the enormous influence of search engines to route traffic and companies which deliberately manipulating search engines for profit become a serious problem. This problem that has not been addressed in traditional closed information retrieval systems. Also, it is interesting to note that metadata efforts have largely failed with web search engines, because any text on the page which is not directly represented to the user is abused to manipulate search engines. There are even numerous companies which specialize in manipulating search engines for profit.</p>\n<h2>4 System Anatomy</h2>\n<p>First, we will provide a high level discussion of the architecture. Then, there is some in-depth descriptions of important data structures. Finally, the major applications: crawling, indexing, and searching will be examined in depth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/over.gif\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1. High Level Google Architecture</p>\n<h3>4.1 Google Architecture Overview</h3>\n<p>In this section, we will give a high level overview of how the whole system works as pictured in Figure 1. Further sections will discuss the applications and data structures not mentioned in this section. Most of Google is implemented in C or C++ for efficiency and can run in either Solaris or Linux.</p>\n<p>In Google, the web crawling (downloading of web pages) is done by several distributed crawlers. There is a URLserver that sends lists of URLs to be fetched to the crawlers. The web pages that are fetched are then sent to the storeserver. The storeserver then compresses and stores the web pages into a repository. Every web page has an associated ID number called a docID which is assigned whenever a new URL is parsed out of a web page. The indexing function is performed by the indexer and the sorter. The indexer performs a number of functions. It reads the repository, uncompresses the documents, and parses them. Each document is converted into a set of word occurrences called hits. The hits record the word, position in document, an approximation of font size, and capitalization. The indexer distributes these hits into a set of \"barrels\", creating a partially sorted forward index. The indexer performs another important function. It parses out all the links in every web page and stores important information about them in an anchors file. This file contains enough information to determine where each link points from and to, and the text of the link.</p>\n<p>The URLresolver reads the anchors file and converts relative URLs into absolute URLs and in turn into docIDs. It puts the anchor text into the forward index, associated with the docID that the anchor points to. It also generates a database of links which are pairs of docIDs. The links database is used to compute PageRanks for all the documents.</p>\n<p>The sorter takes the barrels, which are sorted by docID (this is a simplification, see <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#hits\">Section 4.2.5</a>), and resorts them by wordID to generate the inverted index. This is done in place so that little temporary space is needed for this operation. The sorter also produces a list of wordIDs and offsets into the inverted index. A program called DumpLexicon takes this list together with the lexicon produced by the indexer and generates a new lexicon to be used by the searcher. The searcher is run by a web server and uses the lexicon built by DumpLexicon together with the inverted index and the PageRanks to answer queries.</p>\n<h3>4.2 Major Data Structures</h3>\n<p>Google's data structures are optimized so that a large document collection can be crawled, indexed, and searched with little cost. Although, CPUs and bulk input output rates have improved dramatically over the years, a disk seek still requires about 10 ms to complete. Google is designed to avoid disk seeks whenever possible, and this has had a considerable influence on the design of the data structures.</p>\n<h4>4.2.1 BigFiles</h4>\n<p>BigFiles are virtual files spanning multiple file systems and are addressable by 64 bit integers. The allocation among multiple file systems is handled automatically. The BigFiles package also handles allocation and deallocation of file descriptors, since the operating systems do not provide enough for our needs. BigFiles also support rudimentary compression options.</p>\n<h4>4.2.2 Repository</h4>\n<p><img src=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/repos.gif\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2. Repository Data Structure</p>\n<p>The repository contains the full HTML of every web page. Each page is compressed using zlib (see <a href=\"ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html\">RFC1950</a>). The choice of compression technique is a tradeoff between speed and compression ratio. We chose zlib's speed over a significant improvement in compression offered by <a href=\"http://www.muraroa.demon.co.uk/\">bzip</a>. The compression rate of bzip was approximately 4 to 1 on the repository as compared to zlib's 3 to 1 compression. In the repository, the documents are stored one after the other and are prefixed by docID, length, and URL as can be seen in Figure 2. The repository requires no other data structures to be used in order to access it. This helps with data consistency and makes development much easier; we can rebuild all the other data structures from only the repository and a file which lists crawler errors.</p>\n<h4>4.2.3 Document Index</h4>\n<p>The document index keeps information about each document. It is a fixed width ISAM (Index sequential access mode) index, ordered by docID. The information stored in each entry includes the current document status, a pointer into the repository, a document checksum, and various statistics. If the document has been crawled, it also contains a pointer into a variable width file called docinfo which contains its URL and title. Otherwise the pointer points into the URLlist which contains just the URL. This design decision was driven by the desire to have a reasonably compact data structure, and the ability to fetch a record in one disk seek during a search</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is a file which is used to convert URLs into docIDs. It is a list of URL checksums with their corresponding docIDs and is sorted by checksum. In order to find the docID of a particular URL, the URL's checksum is computed and a binary search is performed on the checksums file to find its docID. URLs may be converted into docIDs in batch by doing a merge with this file. This is the technique the URLresolver uses to turn URLs into docIDs. This batch mode of update is crucial because otherwise we must perform one seek for every link which assuming one disk would take more than a month for our 322 million link dataset.</p>\n<h4>4.2.4 Lexicon</h4>\n<p>The lexicon has several different forms. One important change from earlier systems is that the lexicon can fit in memory for a reasonable price. In the current implementation we can keep the lexicon in memory on a machine with 256 MB of main memory. The current lexicon contains 14 million words (though some rare words were not added to the lexicon). It is implemented in two parts -- a list of the words (concatenated together but separated by nulls) and a hash table of pointers. For various functions, the list of words has some auxiliary information which is beyond the scope of this paper to explain fully.</p>\n<h4>4.2.5 Hit Lists</h4>\n<p>A hit list corresponds to a list of occurrences of a particular word in a particular document including position, font, and capitalization information. Hit lists account for most of the space used in both the forward and the inverted indices. Because of this, it is important to represent them as efficiently as possible. We considered several alternatives for encoding position, font, and capitalization -- simple encoding (a triple of integers), a compact encoding (a hand optimized allocation of bits), and Huffman coding. In the end we chose a hand optimized compact encoding since it required far less space than the simple encoding and far less bit manipulation than Huffman coding. The details of the hits are shown in Figure 3.</p>\n<p>Our compact encoding uses two bytes for every hit. There are two types of hits: fancy hits and plain hits. Fancy hits include hits occurring in a URL, title, anchor text, or meta tag. Plain hits include everything else. A plain hit consists of a capitalization bit, font size, and 12 bits of word position in a document (all positions higher than 4095 are labeled 4096). Font size is represented relative to the rest of the document using three bits (only 7 values are actually used because 111 is the flag that signals a fancy hit). A fancy hit consists of a capitalization bit, the font size set to 7 to indicate it is a fancy hit, 4 bits to encode the type of fancy hit, and 8 bits of position. For anchor hits, the 8 bits of position are split into 4 bits for position in anchor and 4 bits for a hash of the docID the anchor occurs in. This gives us some limited phrase searching as long as there are not that many anchors for a particular word. We expect to update the way that anchor hits are stored to allow for greater resolution in the position and docIDhash fields. We use font size relative to the rest of the document because when searching, you do not want to rank otherwise identical documents differently just because one of the documents is in a larger font.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/barrels.gif\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. Forward and Reverse Indexes and the Lexicon</p>\n<p>The length of a hit list is stored before the hits themselves. To save space, the length of the hit list is combined with the wordID in the forward index and the docID in the inverted index. This limits it to 8 and 5 bits respectively (there are some tricks which allow 8 bits to be borrowed from the wordID). If the length is longer than would fit in that many bits, an escape code is used in those bits, and the next two bytes contain the actual length.</p>\n<h4>4.2.6 Forward Index</h4>\n<p>The forward index is actually already partially sorted. It is stored in a number of barrels (we used 64). Each barrel holds a range of wordID's. If a document contains words that fall into a particular barrel, the docID is recorded into the barrel, followed by a list of wordID's with hitlists which correspond to those words. This scheme requires slightly more storage because of duplicated docIDs but the difference is very small for a reasonable number of buckets and saves considerable time and coding complexity in the final indexing phase done by the sorter. Furthermore, instead of storing actual wordID's, we store each wordID as a relative difference from the minimum wordID that falls into the barrel the wordID is in. This way, we can use just 24 bits for the wordID's in the unsorted barrels, leaving 8 bits for the hit list length.</p>\n<h4>4.2.7 Inverted Index</h4>\n<p>The inverted index consists of the same barrels as the forward index, except that they have been processed by the sorter. For every valid wordID, the lexicon contains a pointer into the barrel that wordID falls into. It points to a doclist of docID's together with their corresponding hit lists. This doclist represents all the occurrences of that word in all documents.</p>\n<p>An important issue is in what order the docID's should appear in the doclist. One simple solution is to store them sorted by docID. This allows for quick merging of different doclists for multiple word queries. Another option is to store them sorted by a ranking of the occurrence of the word in each document. This makes answering one word queries trivial and makes it likely that the answers to multiple word queries are near the start. However, merging is much more difficult. Also, this makes development much more difficult in that a change to the ranking function requires a rebuild of the index. We chose a compromise between these options, keeping two sets of inverted barrels -- one set for hit lists which include title or anchor hits and another set for all hit lists. This way, we check the first set of barrels first and if there are not enough matches within those barrels we check the larger ones.</p>\n<h3>4.3 Crawling the Web</h3>\n<p>Running a web crawler is a challenging task. There are tricky performance and reliability issues and even more importantly, there are social issues. Crawling is the most fragile application since it involves interacting with hundreds of thousands of web servers and various name servers which are all beyond the control of the system.</p>\n<p>In order to scale to hundreds of millions of web pages, Google has a fast distributed crawling system. A single URLserver serves lists of URLs to a number of crawlers (we typically ran about 3). Both the URLserver and the crawlers are implemented in Python. Each crawler keeps roughly 300 connections open at once. This is necessary to retrieve web pages at a fast enough pace. At peak speeds, the system can crawl over 100 web pages per second using four crawlers. This amounts to roughly 600K per second of data. A major performance stress is DNS lookup. Each crawler maintains a its own DNS cache so it does not need to do a DNS lookup before crawling each document. Each of the hundreds of connections can be in a number of different states: looking up DNS, connecting to host, sending request, and receiving response. These factors make the crawler a complex component of the system. It uses asynchronous IO to manage events, and a number of queues to move page fetches from state to state.</p>\n<p>It turns out that running a crawler which connects to more than half a million servers, and generates tens of millions of log entries generates a fair amount of email and phone calls. Because of the vast number of people coming on line, there are always those who do not know what a crawler is, because this is the first one they have seen. Almost daily, we receive an email something like, \"Wow, you looked at a lot of pages from my web site. How did you like it?\" There are also some people who do not know about the <a href=\"http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/norobots.html\">robots exclusion protocol</a>, and think their page should be protected from indexing by a statement like, \"This page is copyrighted and should not be indexed\", which needless to say is difficult for web crawlers to understand. Also, because of the huge amount of data involved, unexpected things will happen. For example, our system tried to crawl an online game. This resulted in lots of garbage messages in the middle of their game! It turns out this was an easy problem to fix. But this problem had not come up until we had downloaded tens of millions of pages. Because of the immense variation in web pages and servers, it is virtually impossible to test a crawler without running it on large part of the Internet. Invariably, there are hundreds of obscure problems which may only occur on one page out of the whole web and cause the crawler to crash, or worse, cause unpredictable or incorrect behavior. Systems which access large parts of the Internet need to be designed to be very robust and carefully tested. Since large complex systems such as crawlers will invariably cause problems, there needs to be significant resources devoted to reading the email and solving these problems as they come up.</p>\n<h3>4.4 Indexing the Web</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Parsing --</strong> Any parser which is designed to run on the entire Web must handle a huge array of possible errors. These range from typos in HTML tags to kilobytes of zeros in the middle of a tag, non-ASCII characters, HTML tags nested hundreds deep, and a great variety of other errors that challenge anyone's imagination to come up with equally creative ones. For maximum speed, instead of using YACC to generate a CFG parser, we use flex to generate a lexical analyzer which we outfit with its own stack. Developing this parser which runs at a reasonable speed and is very robust involved a fair amount of work.</li>\n<li><strong>Indexing</strong> <strong>Documents into Barrels --</strong> After each document is parsed, it is encoded into a number of barrels. Every word is converted into a wordID by using an in-memory hash table -- the lexicon. New additions to the lexicon hash table are logged to a file. Once the words are converted into wordID's, their occurrences in the current document are translated into hit lists and are written into the forward barrels. The main difficulty with parallelization of the indexing phase is that the lexicon needs to be shared. Instead of sharing the lexicon, we took the approach of writing a log of all the extra words that were not in a base lexicon, which we fixed at 14 million words. That way multiple indexers can run in parallel and then the small log file of extra words can be processed by one final indexer.</li>\n<li><strong>Sorting</strong> -- In order to generate the inverted index, the sorter takes each of the forward barrels and sorts it by wordID to produce an inverted barrel for title and anchor hits and a full text inverted barrel. This process happens one barrel at a time, thus requiring little temporary storage. Also, we parallelize the sorting phase to use as many machines as we have simply by running multiple sorters, which can process different buckets at the same time. Since the barrels don't fit into main memory, the sorter further subdivides them into baskets which do fit into memory based on wordID and docID. Then the sorter, loads each basket into memory, sorts it and writes its contents into the short inverted barrel and the full inverted barrel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4.5 Searching</h3>\n<p>The goal of searching is to provide quality search results efficiently. Many of the large commercial search engines seemed to have made great progress in terms of efficiency. Therefore, we have focused more on quality of search in our research, although we believe our solutions are scalable to commercial volumes with a bit more effort. The google query evaluation process is show in Figure 4.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Parse the query.</li>\n<li>Convert words into wordIDs.</li>\n<li>Seek to the start of the doclist in the short barrel for every word.</li>\n<li>Scan through the doclists until there is a document that matches all the search terms.</li>\n<li>Compute the rank of that document for the query.</li>\n<li>If we are in the short barrels and at the end of any doclist, seek to the start of the doclist in the full barrel for every word and go to step 4.</li>\n<li>If we are not at the end of any doclist go to step 4.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sort the documents that have matched by rank and return the top k.</p>\n<p>Figure 4. Google Query Evaluation</p>\n<p>To put a limit on response time, once a certain number (currently 40,000) of matching documents are found, the searcher automatically goes to step 8 in Figure 4. This means that it is possible that sub-optimal results would be returned. We are currently investigating other ways to solve this problem. In the past, we sorted the hits according to PageRank, which seemed to improve the situation.</p>\n<h4>4.5.1 The Ranking System</h4>\n<p>Google maintains much more information about web documents than typical search engines. Every hitlist includes position, font, and capitalization information. Additionally, we factor in hits from anchor text and the PageRank of the document. Combining all of this information into a rank is difficult. We designed our ranking function so that no particular factor can have too much influence. First, consider the simplest case -- a single word query. In order to rank a document with a single word query, Google looks at that document's hit list for that word. Google considers each hit to be one of several different types (title, anchor, URL, plain text large font, plain text small font, ...), each of which has its own type-weight. The type-weights make up a vector indexed by type. Google counts the number of hits of each type in the hit list. Then every count is converted into a count-weight. Count-weights increase linearly with counts at first but quickly taper off so that more than a certain count will not help. We take the dot product of the vector of count-weights with the vector of type-weights to compute an IR score for the document. Finally, the IR score is combined with PageRank to give a final rank to the document.</p>\n<p>For a multi-word search, the situation is more complicated. Now multiple hit lists must be scanned through at once so that hits occurring close together in a document are weighted higher than hits occurring far apart. The hits from the multiple hit lists are matched up so that nearby hits are matched together. For every matched set of hits, a proximity is computed. The proximity is based on how far apart the hits are in the document (or anchor) but is classified into 10 different value \"bins\" ranging from a phrase match to \"not even close\". Counts are computed not only for every type of hit but for every type and proximity. Every type and proximity pair has a type-prox-weight. The counts are converted into count-weights and we take the dot product of the count-weights and the type-prox-weights to compute an IR score. All of these numbers and matrices can all be displayed with the search results using a special debug mode. These displays have been very helpful in developing the ranking system.</p>\n<h4>4.5.2 Feedback</h4>\n<p>The ranking function has many parameters like the type-weights and the type-prox-weights. Figuring out the right values for these parameters is something of a black art. In order to do this, we have a user feedback mechanism in the search engine. A trusted user may optionally evaluate all of the results that are returned. This feedback is saved. Then when we modify the ranking function, we can see the impact of this change on all previous searches which were ranked. Although far from perfect, this gives us some idea of how a change in the ranking function affects the search results.</p>\n<h2>5 Results and Performance</h2>\n<p>   The most important measure of a search engine is the quality of its search results. While a complete user evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper, our own experience with Google has shown it to produce better results than the major commercial search engines for most searches. As an example which illustrates the use of PageRank, anchor text, and proximity, Figure 4 shows Google's results for a search on \"bill clinton\". These results demonstrates some of Google's features. The results are clustered by server. This helps considerably when sifting through result sets. A number of results are from the whitehouse.gov domain which is what one may reasonably expect from such a search. Currently, most major commercial search engines do not return any results from whitehouse.gov, much less the right ones. Notice that there is no title for the first result. This is because it was not crawled. Instead, Google relied on anchor text to determine this was a good answer to the query. Similarly, the fifth result is an email address which, of course, is not crawlable. It is also a result of anchor text.</p>\n<p>All of the results are reasonably high quality pages and, at last check, none were broken links. This is largely because they all have high PageRank. The PageRanks are the percentages in red along with bar graphs. Finally, there are no results about a Bill other than Clinton or about a Clinton other than Bill. This is because we place heavy importance on the proximity of word occurrences. Of course a true test of the quality of a search engine would involve an extensive user study or results analysis which we do not have room for here. Instead, we invite the reader to try Google for themselves at <a href=\"http://google.stanford.edu/\">http://google.stanford.edu</a>.</p>\n<h3>5.1 Storage Requirements</h3>\n<p>Aside from search quality, Google is designed to scale cost effectively to the size of the Web as it grows. One aspect of this is to use storage efficiently. Table 1 has a breakdown of some statistics and storage requirements of Google. Due to compression the total size of the repository is about 53 GB, just over one third of the total data it stores. At current disk prices this makes the repository a relatively cheap source of useful data. More importantly, the total of all the data used by the search engine requires a comparable amount of storage, about 55 GB. Furthermore, most queries can be answered using just the short inverted index. With better encoding and compression of the Document Index, a high quality web search engine may fit onto a 7GB drive of a new PC.  </p>\n<p>Storage Statistics</p>\n<p>Total Size of Fetched Pages</p>\n<p>147.8 GB</p>\n<p>Compressed Repository</p>\n<p>53.5 GB</p>\n<p>Short Inverted Index</p>\n<p>4.1 GB</p>\n<p>Full Inverted Index</p>\n<p>37.2 GB</p>\n<p>Lexicon</p>\n<p>293 MB</p>\n<p>Temporary Anchor Data <br>\n(not in total)</p>\n<p>6.6 GB</p>\n<p>Document Index Incl. <br>\nVariable Width Data</p>\n<p>9.7 GB</p>\n<p>Links Database</p>\n<p>3.9 GB</p>\n<p>Total Without Repository</p>\n<p>55.2 GB</p>\n<p>Total With Repository</p>\n<p>108.7 GB</p>\n<p>Web Page Statistics</p>\n<p>Number of Web Pages Fetched</p>\n<p>24 million</p>\n<p>Number of Urls Seen</p>\n<p>76.5 million</p>\n<p>Number of Email Addresses</p>\n<p>1.7 million</p>\n<p>Number of 404's</p>\n<p>1.6 million</p>\n<p>Table 1. Statistics</p>\n<h3> 5.2 System Performance</h3>\n<p>It is important for a search engine to crawl and index efficiently. This way information can be kept up to date and major changes to the system can be tested relatively quickly. For Google, the major operations are Crawling, Indexing, and Sorting. It is difficult to measure how long crawling took overall because disks filled up, name servers crashed, or any number of other problems which stopped the system. In total it took roughly 9 days to download the 26 million pages (including errors). However, once the system was running smoothly, it ran much faster, downloading the last 11 million pages in just 63 hours, averaging just over 4 million pages per day or 48.5 pages per second. We ran the indexer and the crawler simultaneously. The indexer ran just faster than the crawlers. This is largely because we spent just enough time optimizing the indexer so that it would not be a bottleneck. These optimizations included bulk updates to the document index and placement of critical data structures on the local disk. The indexer runs at roughly 54 pages per second. The sorters can be run completely in parallel; using four machines, the whole process of sorting takes about 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>5.3 Search Performance</h3>\n<p>Improving the performance of search was not the major focus of our research up to this point. The current version of Google answers most queries in between 1 and 10 seconds. This time is mostly dominated by disk IO over NFS (since disks are spread over a number of machines). Furthermore, Google does not have any optimizations such as query caching, subindices on common terms, and other common optimizations. We intend to speed up Google considerably through distribution and hardware, software, and algorithmic improvements. Our target is to be able to handle several hundred queries per second. Table 2 has some sample query times from the current version of Google. They are repeated to show the speedups resulting from cached IO.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Query</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Same Query Repeated (IO mostly cached)</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Query</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CPU Time(s)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total Time(s)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CPU Time(s)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total Time(s)</strong></p>\n<p>al gore</p>\n<p>0.09</p>\n<p>2.13</p>\n<p>0.06</p>\n<p>0.06</p>\n<p>vice president</p>\n<p>1.77</p>\n<p>3.84</p>\n<p>1.66</p>\n<p>1.80</p>\n<p>hard disks</p>\n<p>0.25</p>\n<p>4.86</p>\n<p>0.20</p>\n<p>0.24</p>\n<p>search engines</p>\n<p>1.31</p>\n<p>9.63</p>\n<p>1.16</p>\n<p>1.16</p>\n<p>Table 2. Search Times</p>\n<h2>6 Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Google is designed to be a scalable search engine. The primary goal is to provide high quality search results over a rapidly growing World Wide Web. Google employs a number of techniques to improve search quality including page rank, anchor text, and proximity information. Furthermore, Google is a complete architecture for gathering web pages, indexing them, and performing search queries over them.</p>\n<h3>6.1 Future Work</h3>\n<p>A large-scale web search engine is a complex system and much remains to be done. Our immediate goals are to improve search efficiency and to scale to approximately 100 million web pages. Some simple improvements to efficiency include query caching, smart disk allocation, and subindices. Another area which requires much research is updates. We must have smart algorithms to decide what old web pages should be recrawled and what new ones should be crawled. Work toward this goal has been done in [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Cho 98</a>]. One promising area of research is using proxy caches to build search databases, since they are demand driven. We are planning to add simple features supported by commercial search engines like boolean operators, negation, and stemming. However, other features are just starting to be explored such as relevance feedback and clustering (Google currently supports a simple hostname based clustering). We also plan to support user context (like the user's location), and result summarization. We are also working to extend the use of link structure and link text. Simple experiments indicate PageRank can be personalized by increasing the weight of a user's home page or bookmarks. As for link text, we are experimenting with using text surrounding links in addition to the link text itself. A Web search engine is a very rich environment for research ideas. We have far too many to list here so we do not expect this Future Work section to become much shorter in the near future.</p>\n<h3>6.2 High Quality Search</h3>\n<p>The biggest problem facing users of web search engines today is the quality of the results they get back. While the results are often amusing and expand users' horizons, they are often frustrating and consume precious time. For example, the top result for a search for \"Bill Clinton\" on one of the most popular commercial search engines was the <a href=\"http://www.io.com/~cjburke/clinton/970414.html\">Bill Clinton Joke of the Day: April 14, 1997</a>. Google is designed to provide higher quality search so as the Web continues to grow rapidly, information can be found easily. In order to accomplish this Google makes heavy use of hypertextual information consisting of link structure and link (anchor) text. Google also uses proximity and font information. While evaluation of a search engine is difficult, we have subjectively found that Google returns higher quality search results than current commercial search engines. The analysis of link structure via PageRank allows Google to evaluate the quality of web pages. The use of link text as a description of what the link points to helps the search engine return relevant (and to some degree high quality) results. Finally, the use of proximity information helps increase relevance a great deal for many queries.</p>\n<h3>6.3 Scalable Architecture</h3>\n<p>Aside from the quality of search, Google is designed to scale. It must be efficient in both space and time, and constant factors are very important when dealing with the entire Web. In implementing Google, we have seen bottlenecks in CPU, memory access, memory capacity, disk seeks, disk throughput, disk capacity, and network IO. Google has evolved to overcome a number of these bottlenecks during various operations. Google's major data structures make efficient use of available storage space. Furthermore, the crawling, indexing, and sorting operations are efficient enough to be able to build an index of a substantial portion of the web -- 24 million pages, in less than one week. We expect to be able to build an index of 100 million pages in less than a month.</p>\n<h3>6.4 A Research Tool</h3>\n<p>In addition to being a high quality search engine, Google is a research tool. The data Google has collected has already resulted in many other papers submitted to conferences and many more on the way. Recent research such as [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Abiteboul 97</a>] has shown a number of limitations to queries about the Web that may be answered without having the Web available locally.

It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!</p>\n<p>Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.</p>\n<p>A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.</p>\n<p>When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.</p>\n<p>This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.</p>\n<p>Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.</p>\n<p>In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.</p>\n<h2>A Vast Number of Libraries</h2>\n<p>npm with its simple structure helped the ecosystem of Node.js proliferate, and now the npm registry hosts over 1,000,000 open source packages you can freely use.</p>\n<h2>An Example Node.js Application</h2>\n<p>The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:</p>\n<iframe\n  title=\"Hello world web server\"\n  src=\"https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/nodejs-dev-0001-01?path=server.js&previewSize=30&attributionHidden=true&sidebarCollapsed=true\"\n  alt=\"nodejs-dev-0001-01 on Glitch\"\n  style=\"height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;\">\n</iframe>\n<!--```js\nconst http = require('http')\n\nconst hostname = '127.0.0.1'\nconst port = 3000\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n  res.statusCode = 200\n  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')\n  res.end('Hello World\\n')\n})\n\nserver.listen(port, hostname, () => {\n  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`)\n})\n```\n\nTo run this snippet, save it as a `server.js` file and run `node server.js` in your terminal.-->\n<p>This code first includes the Node.js <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html\"><code>http</code> module</a>.</p>\n<p>Node.js has a fantastic <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/\">standard library</a>, including first-class support for networking.</p>\n<p>The <code>createServer()</code> method of <code>http</code> creates a new HTTP server and returns it.</p>\n<p>The server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.</p>\n<p>Whenever a new request is received, the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request\"><code>request</code> event</a> is called, providing two objects: a request (an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage\"><code>http.IncomingMessage</code></a> object) and a response (an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse\"><code>http.ServerResponse</code></a> object).</p>\n<p>Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.</p>\n<p>The first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.</p>\n<p>The second is used to return data to the caller.</p>\n<p>In this case with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">res.statusCode = 200;\n</code></pre>\n<p>we set the statusCode property to 200, to indicate a successful response.</p>\n<p>We set the Content-Type header:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n</code></pre>\n<p>and we close the response, adding the content as an argument to <code>end()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">res.end('Hello World\\n');\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Node.js Frameworks and Tools</h2>\n<p>Node.js is a low-level platform. In order to make things easy and exciting for developers, thousands of libraries were built upon Node.js by the community.</p>\n<p>Many of those established over time as popular options.

For example, in our <em>Asynchronous</em> lesson, we noted how <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#timers_settimeout_callback_delay_args\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Node’s setTimeout</a> has a slightly different return value from <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">a browser’s setTimeout</a>. Let’s go over a few notable differences between the two environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Global vs Window</strong></p>\n<p>In the Node.js runtime, the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">global object</a> is the object where global variables are stored. In browsers, the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">window object</a> is where global variables are stored. The window also includes properties and methods that deal with drawing things on the screen like images, links, and buttons. Node doesn’t need to draw anything, and so it does not come with such properties. This means that you can’t reference window in Node.</p>\n<p><em>Most browsers allow you to reference global but it is really the same object as window.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Document</strong></p>\n<p>Browsers have access to a document object that contains the HTML of a page that will be rendered to the browser window. There is no document in Node.</p>\n<p><strong>Location</strong></p>\n<p>Browsers have access to a location that contains information about the web address being visited in the browser. There is no location in Node, since it is not on the web.</p>\n<p><strong>Require and module.exports</strong></p>\n<p>Node has a predefined require function that we can use to import installed modules like readline. We can also import and export across our own files using require and module.exports. For example, say we had two different files, animals.js and cat.js, that existed in the same directory:</p>\n<p>If we execute animals.js in Node, the program would print ‘Sennacy is a great pet!’.</p>\n<p>Browsers don’t have a notion of a file system so we cannot use require or module.exports in the same way.</p>\n<h3>The fs module</h3>\n<p>Node comes with an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">fs module</a> that contains methods that allow us to interact with our computer’s <strong>F</strong>ile <strong>S</strong>ystem through JavaScript. No additional installations are required; to access this module we can simply <code>require</code> it. We recommend that you code along with this reading. Let's begin with a <code>change-some-files.js</code> script that imports the module:</p>\n<pre><code>// change-some-files.js\n\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similar to what we saw in the <code>readline</code> lesson, <code>require</code> will return to us a object with many properties that will enable us to do file I/O.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> <em>I/O is short for input/output. It’s usage is widespread and all the hip tech companies are using it, like.io.</em></p>\n<p>The <code>fs</code> module contains tons of functionality! Chances are that if there is some operation you need to perform regarding files, the <code>fs</code> module supports it. The module also offers both synchronous and asynchronous implementations of these methods. We prefer to not block the thread and so we'll opt for the asynchronous flavors of these methods.</p>\n<h3>Creating a new file</h3>\n<p>To create a file, we can use the <code>writeFile</code> method. According to the documentation, there are a few ways to use it. The most straight forward way is:</p>\n<p>The code a<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/8898ad673bd2ecee9d93f8ec267cf213\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">create-a-nnew-file.js (github.com)</a>bove will create a new file called <code>foo.txt</code> in the same directory as our <code>change-some-file.js</code> script. It will write the string <code>'Hello world!'</code> into that newly created file. The third argument specifies the encoding of the characters. There are different ways to encode characters; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">UTF-8</a> is the most common and you'll use this in most scenarios. The fourth argument to <code>writeFile</code> is a callback that will be invoked when the write operation is complete. The docs indicate that if there is an error during the operation (such as an invalid encoding argument), an error object will be passed into the callback. This type of error handling is quite common for asynchronous functions. Like we are used to, since <code>writeFile</code> is asynchronous, we need to utilize <em>callback chaining</em> if we want to guarantee that commands occur <em>after</em> the write is complete or fails.</p>\n<p><em>Beware! If the file name specified to</em> <code>writeFile</code> <em>already exists, it will completely overwrite the contents of that file.</em></p>\n<p>We won’t be using the <code>foo.txt</code> file in the rest of this reading.</p>\n<h3>Reading existing files</h3>\n<p>To explore how to read a file, we’ll use VSCode to manually create a <code>poetry.txt</code> file within the same directory as our <code>change-some-file.js</code> script. Be sure to create this if you are following along.</p>\n<p>Our <code>poetry.txt</code> file will contain the following lines:</p>\n<pre><code>My code fails\n\nI do not know why\n\nMy code works\n\nI do not know why\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can use the <code>readFile</code> method to read the contents of this file. The method accepts very similar arguments to <code>writeFile</code>, except that the callback may be passed an error object and string containing the file contents. In the snippet below, we have replaced our previous <code>writeFile</code> code with <code>readFile</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Running the code above would print the following in the terminal:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>THE CONTENTS ARE:\n\nMy code fails\n\nI do not know why\n\nMy code works\n\nI do not know why\n</code></pre>\n<p>Success! From here, you can do anything you please with the data read from the file. For example, since <code>data</code> is a string, we could split the string on the newline character <code>\\n</code> to obtain an array of the file's lines:</p>\n<pre><code>THE CONTENTS ARE:\n\n[ 'My code fails',\n\n'I do not know why',\n\n'My code works',\n\n'I do not know why' ]\n\nThe third line is My code works\n</code></pre>\n<h3>File I/O</h3>\n<p><em>Using the same</em> <code>poetry.txt</code> <em>file from before:</em></p>\n<pre><code>My code fails\n\nI do not know why\n\nMy code works\n\nI do not know why\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let’s replace occurrences of the phrase ‘do not’ with the word ‘should’.</p>\n<p>We can read the contents of the file as a string, manipulate this string, then write this new string back into the file.</p>\n<p>We’ll need to utilize callback chaining in order for this to work since our file I/O is asynchronous:</p>\n<p>Executing the script above will edit the <code>poetry.txt</code> file to contain:</p>\n<pre><code>My code fails\n\nI should know why\n\nMy code works\n\nI should know why\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Refactor:</h4>\n<h4>If you found this guide helpful feel free to checkout my github/gists where I host similar content:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">bgoonz’s gists · GitHub</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\"><strong>bgoonz — Overview</strong><br />\n<em>Web Developer, Electrical Engineer JavaScript | CSS | Bootstrap | Python | React | Node.js | Express | Sequelize…</em>github.com</a><a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock\"></a></p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/nextjs/","relativePath":"docs/articles/nextjs.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"nextjs.md","name":"nextjs","frontmatter":{"title":"lorem-ipsum","weight":0,"excerpt":"With some basic React and JavaScript knowledge, you’ll be on your wayNext.js is a JavaScript framework created by Zeit.

It has many great features and advantages, which can make Nextjs your first option for building your next web application.</p>\n<p>You don’t need any configuration of webpack or similar to start using Next.js. It comes with its configuration. All you need is to run <code>npm run dev</code> and start building your application ?.</p>\n<p>In this article, we are going to explore the great features and tricks of Next.js, and how to start building your next website with it.</p>\n<p><strong>This post assumes that you have some basic knowledge of React and JavaScript.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some great websites built with Next.js:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://syntax.fm/\">Syntaxt.fm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npmjs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://material-ui.com/\">material-ui.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://expo.io/\">expo.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codementor.io/\">codemenitor.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I even used Nextjs to build my personal website <a href=\"https://www.saidhayani.me/\">saidhayani.me</a> — you can get the source code on GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/hayanisaid/said-hayani-nextjs\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Getting starting with Next.js</h3>\n<p>To start with Next.js you need to have node.js installed in your machine and that’s all. Next.js is like any other node.js application — you need npm or Yarn to install dependencies.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started and create a Next.js project.</p>\n<p>First, we need to create a folder and give it a name of our choice. I’m gonna name it <code>nextjs-app</code>.</p>\n<p>You can easily do that with this command line:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*k8DzCXqZwRaY64Bhli5-yQ.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>mkdir nextjs-app\n</code></pre>\n<p>After creating the nextjs-app folder, open it on the terminal. Run <code>npm init</code> to create the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>\n<p>Next, we have to install our dependencies.</p>\n<p>Installing Next.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>using Yarn, type</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>yarn add next\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>using npm, type:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>npm i next --save\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then we have to install React because Next.js uses React. The first line below uses Yarn for the installation.</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add react react-dom\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// with npm\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>npm i react react-dom --save\n</code></pre>\n<p>After that you have to create two necessary folders: <code>pages</code> and <code>static</code> . Next.js won’t work without them!!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*s3N5eZcSSSgRdBiaMQeCRA.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>mkdir pages static\n</code></pre>\n<p>You <strong>must</strong> have this structure after running these commands :</p>\n<pre><code>nextjs-app  -pages  -static  -package.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then simply you can run <code>npm next dev</code> and then open <code>[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)</code> in your browser.</p>\n<p>The <code>NotFound</code> page will show up because we don't have any page yet!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Hv_4BaqTnrlriZ8Q3zk5ZQ.png\"></p>\n<p>So let’s create a <code>home</code> page and an entry point <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*IwZ5Ahr9egJ8KHF5HnLfHQ.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>touch index.js home.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then you can write a normal React component. As I said above, Next.js is for building React applications.</p>\n<p>Here is what our <code>home.js</code> looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*He5fQw-VgeY5Gjo2RFGckw.png\"></p>\n<p>And here is our <code>index.js</code> file:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*AgGKp-WdRTwb3bOuqljcug.png\"></p>\n<p>Next.js has a live reload feature. All you need to do is just change and save, and Next.js will compile and reload the app automatically for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Next.js is like any other server-side rendering tool we need to define the default page of our application, in our case is <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n<p>You will see this change in the browser after running <code>npm next dev</code>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*QuQK1J5P0Rc4S-0BhllNmg.png\"></p>\n<p>Congratulations! We just created a Next.js app with a few simple steps. These instructions to create a Next.js app are described in the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started/first-page\">official docs of Next.js</a> .</p>\n<h4>My alternative</h4>\n<p>I usually don’t use this way. I use the <a href=\"http://import%20react%20from/\">create-next-app</a> CLI instead that will do all this stuff for me in one single line.</p>\n<pre><code>npx create-next-app my-app\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*W5KCIFWP7yMHI-zaeVcmPA.png\"></p>\n<p>You can check out the documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app\">here</a> to explore more features.</p>\n<h3>Create custom configs for Next.js</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you might want to add some additional dependencies or packages to your Next.js app.</p>\n<p>Next.js gives you the option to customize your configuration using a <code>next-config.js</code> file.</p>\n<p>For example, you might want to add sass support to your app. In this case you have to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-sass\">next-sass</a> package <strong>and</strong> you have to add it to the <code>next-config.js</code> file as in the example below:</p>\n<p>First, install <code>next-sass</code>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*5XSEx8DH0851FNzMxDx5LQ.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>yarn add @zeit/next-sass\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then include it inside the <code>next-config.js</code> file:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*YN_aoR5dzlnMyG2xVHJcww.png\"></p>\n<p>And then you can create write your sass code and import it in your component:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*kde4wjR-EpoNHc1c4JTb8g.png\"></p>\n<p>Importing the sass file in our component:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*yv1cTBXPeONqaV-CS1OZ2A.png\"></p>\n<p>And here is the result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*VYfSkK1fIZKu75-2P8s4Bw.png\"></p>\n<p>Wow, wasn’t that <strong>super easy</strong> to add sass support to out Next.js app?</p>\n<p>At this point, we just covered the installation and configuration part. Now let’s talk about the features of Next.js!</p>\n<h3>The features</h3>\n<p>Next.js comes with a bunch of great features like server-side rendering, routers, and lazy loading.</p>\n<h4>Server-side rendering</h4>\n<p>Next.js performs server-side rendering by default. This makes your application optimized for search engines. Also, you can integrate any middleware such as <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">express.js</a> or <a href=\"https://hapijs.com/\">Hapi.js</a>, and you can run any database such as MongoDB or MySQL.</p>\n<p>Speaking of search engine optimization, Next.js comes with a <code>Head</code> component that allows you to add and make dynamic meta tags. It’s my favorite feature — you can make custom and dynamic meta tags. These make your website able to be indexed by search engines like Google. Here is an example of a <code>Head</code> component :</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*mnIJGBgF59r1YjX5jXu8IA.png\"></p>\n<p>And you can import and use the<code>Head</code> component in any other page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*liF5bNPAQ_j7gA9funSGTg.png\"></p>\n<p>Awesome!</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: With Next.js you <strong>don’t</strong> need to import React because Next.js does this for you.</p>\n<h4>Generating a static website with Next.js</h4>\n<p>As well as server-side rendering, you still can compile and export your application as an HTML static website and deploy it on a static website hosting like a GitHub page or <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">netlify</a>. You can learn more how to make a static website with Next.js <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/static-html-export/setup\">here in the official docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Routers</h4>\n<p>This is another one of the great features of Next.js. When you use the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\">create-react-app</a>, you usually need to install <a href=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\">react-router</a> and create its custom configuration.</p>\n<p>Next.js comes with its own routers with zero configs. You don’t need any extra configuration of your routers. Just create your page inside the <code>pages</code> folder and Next.js will take care of all routing configuration.</p>\n<p>Let’s go ahead and create a custom navigation to make everything clear!</p>\n<p>To navigate between pages, Next.js has the <code>Link</code> method to manage the navigation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*D54h6wnKX9fCS0AU34tVLA.png\"></p>\n<p>Let’s create <code>blog.js</code> and <code>contact.js</code> pages:</p>\n<p><code>blog.js</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*f6_vaaPs1Okfj8vZ9Fhk8g.png\"></p>\n<p>And here is the <code>contact.js</code> page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*5lWCDzAUWed2NlsGpTC5EQ.png\"></p>\n<p>And now we must be able to navigate between those pages ?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*7WYZeRb92PAwqthLo0xqHg.gif\"></p>\n<p>Wow that so easy and super awesome.</p>\n<h4>Lazy loading</h4>\n<p>Lazy loading makes your application deliver a better user experience. Sometimes the page might take time to load. The user may abandon your app if the loading takes more than 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>The way to avoid this is to use some trick to indicate to the user that the page is loading, for example by displaying a spinner. Lazy loading or code splitting is one of the features that allow you to deal with, and control, slow loading so you only load the necessary code in your page.</p>\n<p>Next.js comes with its own code splitting method. It provides us a method, called <code>dynamic</code>, to load our component, as in the example below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Ib835M7Ih-RY1kRBOUnXFA.png\"></p>\n<p>You can find the source code of these examples on <a href=\"https://github.com/hayanisaid/nextjs-intro-example\">GitHub</a></p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/node-cli-args/","relativePath":"docs/articles/node-cli-args.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"node-cli-args.md","name":"node-cli-args","frontmatter":{"title":"where-is-npm-pack","weight":0,"excerpt":"How to find out where npm installs the packages","seo":{"title":"npm packages","description":"When you install a package using npm you can perform 2 types of installation:\na local install\na global install\n\nBy default, when you type an npm install command, like:\nthe package is installed in the current file tree, under the node_modules subfolder.\n","robots":[],"extra":[{"name":"og:description","value":"When you install a package using npm you can perform 2 types of installation:\na local install\na global install\n\nBy default, when you type an npm install command, like:\nthe package is installed in the current file tree, under the node_modules subfolder.\n","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":false}],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>When you install a package using npm you can perform 2 types of installation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a local install</li>\n<li>a global install</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By default, when you type an npm install command, like:</p>\n<p>the package is installed in the current file tree, under the node_modules subfolder.</p>\n<p>As this happens, npm also adds the lodash entry in the dependencies property of the package.json file present in the current folder.</p>\n<p>A global installation is performed using the -g flag:</p>\n<p>When this happens, npm won't install the package under the local folder, but instead, it will use a global location.</p>\n<p>Where, exactly?</p>\n<p>The npm root -g command will tell you where that exact location is on your machine.</p>\n<p>On macOS or Linux this location could be /usr/local/lib/node<em>modules.

For example, consider a file named <code>foo.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const circle = require('./circle.js');\nconsole.log(`The area of a circle of radius 4 is ${circle.area(4)}`);\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the first line, <code>foo.js</code> loads the module <code>circle.js</code> that is in the same directory as <code>foo.js</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are the contents of <code>circle.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const { PI } = Math;\n\nexports.area = (r) => PI * r ** 2;\n\nexports.circumference = (r) => 2 * PI * r;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The module <code>circle.js</code> has exported the functions <code>area()</code> and <code>circumference()</code>. Functions and objects are added to the root of a module by specifying additional properties on the special <code>exports</code> object.</p>\n<p>Variables local to the module will be private, because the module is wrapped in a function by Node.js (see <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_wrapper\">module wrapper</a>). In this example, the variable <code>PI</code> is private to <code>circle.js</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>module.exports</code> property can be assigned a new value (such as a function or object).</p>\n<p>Below, <code>bar.js</code> makes use of the <code>square</code> module, which exports a Square class:</p>\n<pre><code>const Square = require('./square.js');\nconst mySquare = new Square(2);\nconsole.log(`The area of mySquare is ${mySquare.area()}`);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>square</code> module is defined in <code>square.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Assigning to exports will not modify module, must use module.exports\nmodule.exports = class Square {\n  constructor(width) {\n    this.width = width;\n  }\n\n  area() {\n    return this.width ** 2;\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The module system is implemented in the <code>require('module')</code> module.</p>\n<h3>Accessing the main module<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_accessing_the_main_module\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When a file is run directly from Node.js, <code>require.main</code> is set to its <code>module</code>. That means that it is possible to determine whether a file has been run directly by testing <code>require.main === module</code>.</p>\n<p>For a file <code>foo.js</code>, this will be <code>true</code> if run via <code>node foo.js</code>, but <code>false</code> if run by <code>require('./foo')</code>.</p>\n<p>Because <code>module</code> provides a <code>filename</code> property (normally equivalent to <code>__filename</code>), the entry point of the current application can be obtained by checking <code>require.main.filename</code>.</p>\n<h3>Package manager tips<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_package_manager_tips\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The semantics of the Node.js <code>require()</code> function were designed to be general enough to support reasonable directory structures. Package manager programs such as <code>dpkg</code>, <code>rpm</code>, and <code>npm</code> will hopefully find it possible to build native packages from Node.js modules without modification.</p>\n<p>Below we give a suggested directory structure that could work:</p>\n<p>Let's say that we wanted to have the folder at <code>/usr/lib/node/&#x3C;some-package>/&#x3C;some-version></code> hold the contents of a specific version of a package.</p>\n<p>Packages can depend on one another. In order to install package <code>foo</code>, it may be necessary to install a specific version of package <code>bar</code>. The <code>bar</code> package may itself have dependencies, and in some cases, these may even collide or form cyclic dependencies.</p>\n<p>Because Node.js looks up the <code>realpath</code> of any modules it loads (that is, it resolves symlinks) and then <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_node_modules_folders\">looks for their dependencies in <code>node_modules</code> folders</a>, this situation can be resolved with the following architecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/</code>: Contents of the <code>foo</code> package, version 1.2.3.</li>\n<li><code>/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/</code>: Contents of the <code>bar</code> package that <code>foo</code> depends on.</li>\n<li><code>/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/node_modules/bar</code>: Symbolic link to <code>/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/</code>.</li>\n<li><code>/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/node_modules/*</code>: Symbolic links to the packages that <code>bar</code> depends on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, even if a cycle is encountered, or if there are dependency conflicts, every module will be able to get a version of its dependency that it can use.</p>\n<p>When the code in the <code>foo</code> package does <code>require('bar')</code>, it will get the version that is symlinked into <code>/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/node_modules/bar</code>. Then, when the code in the <code>bar</code> package calls <code>require('quux')</code>, it'll get the version that is symlinked into <code>/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/node_modules/quux</code>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, to make the module lookup process even more optimal, rather than putting packages directly in <code>/usr/lib/node</code>, we could put them in <code>/usr/lib/node_modules/&#x3C;name>/&#x3C;version></code>. Then Node.js will not bother looking for missing dependencies in <code>/usr/node_modules</code> or <code>/node_modules</code>.</p>\n<p>In order to make modules available to the Node.js REPL, it might be useful to also add the <code>/usr/lib/node_modules</code> folder to the <code>$NODE_PATH</code> environment variable. Since the module lookups using <code>node_modules</code> folders are all relative, and based on the real path of the files making the calls to <code>require()</code>, the packages themselves can be anywhere.</p>\n<h3>The <code>.mjs</code> extension<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_mjs_extension\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It is not possible to <code>require()</code> files that have the <code>.mjs</code> extension. Attempting to do so will throw <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_err_require_esm\">an error</a>. The <code>.mjs</code> extension is reserved for <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html\">ECMAScript Modules</a> which cannot be loaded via <code>require()</code>. See <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html\">ECMAScript Modules</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3>All together...<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To get the exact filename that will be loaded when <code>require()</code> is called, use the <code>require.resolve()</code> function.</p>\n<p>Putting together all of the above, here is the high-level algorithm in pseudocode of what <code>require()</code> does:</p>\n<p>require(X) from module at path Y</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If X is a core module,\na. return the core module\nb.

LOAD</em>AS<em>DIRECTORY(RESOLVED</em>PATH)</li>\n<li>THROW \"not found\"</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Caching<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_caching\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Modules are cached after the first time they are loaded. This means (among other things) that every call to <code>require('foo')</code> will get exactly the same object returned, if it would resolve to the same file.</p>\n<p>Provided <code>require.cache</code> is not modified, multiple calls to <code>require('foo')</code> will not cause the module code to be executed multiple times. This is an important feature. With it, \"partially done\" objects can be returned, thus allowing transitive dependencies to be loaded even when they would cause cycles.</p>\n<p>To have a module execute code multiple times, export a function, and call that function.</p>\n<h4>Module caching caveats<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_caching_caveats\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Modules are cached based on their resolved filename. Since modules may resolve to a different filename based on the location of the calling module (loading from <code>node_modules</code> folders), it is not a <em>guarantee</em> that <code>require('foo')</code> will always return the exact same object, if it would resolve to different files.</p>\n<p>Additionally, on case-insensitive file systems or operating systems, different resolved filenames can point to the same file, but the cache will still treat them as different modules and will reload the file multiple times. For example, <code>require('./foo')</code> and <code>require('./FOO')</code> return two different objects, irrespective of whether or not <code>./foo</code> and <code>./FOO</code> are the same file.</p>\n<h3>Core modules<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_core_modules\">#</a></h3>\n<p>History</p>\n<p>Node.js has several modules compiled into the binary. These modules are described in greater detail elsewhere in this documentation.</p>\n<p>The core modules are defined within the Node.js source and are located in the <code>lib/</code> folder.</p>\n<p>Core modules are always preferentially loaded if their identifier is passed to <code>require()</code>. For instance, <code>require('http')</code> will always return the built in HTTP module, even if there is a file by that name.</p>\n<p>Core modules can also be identified using the <code>node:</code> prefix, in which case it bypasses the <code>require</code> cache. For instance, <code>require('node:http')</code> will always return the built in HTTP module, even if there is <code>require.cache</code> entry by that name.</p>\n<h3>Cycles<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_cycles\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When there are circular <code>require()</code> calls, a module might not have finished executing when it is returned.</p>\n<p>Consider this situation:</p>\n<p><code>a.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>console.log('a starting');\nexports.done = false;\nconst b = require('./b.js');\nconsole.log('in a, b.done = %j', b.done);\nexports.done = true;\nconsole.log('a done');\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>b.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>console.log('b starting');\nexports.done = false;\nconst a = require('./a.js');\nconsole.log('in b, a.done = %j', a.done);\nexports.done = true;\nconsole.log('b done');\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>main.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>console.log('main starting');\nconst a = require('./a.js');\nconst b = require('./b.js');\nconsole.log('in main, a.done = %j, b.done = %j', a.done, b.done);\n</code></pre>\n<p>When <code>main.js</code> loads <code>a.js</code>, then <code>a.js</code> in turn loads <code>b.js</code>. At that point, <code>b.js</code> tries to load <code>a.js</code>. In order to prevent an infinite loop, an unfinished copy of the <code>a.js</code> exports object is returned to the <code>b.js</code> module. <code>b.js</code> then finishes loading, and its <code>exports</code> object is provided to the <code>a.js</code> module.</p>\n<p>By the time <code>main.js</code> has loaded both modules, they're both finished. The output of this program would thus be:</p>\n<pre><code>$ node main.js\nmain starting\na starting\nb starting\nin b, a.done = false\nb done\nin a, b.done = true\na done\nin main, a.done = true, b.done = true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Careful planning is required to allow cyclic module dependencies to work correctly within an application.</p>\n<h3>File modules<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_file_modules\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If the exact filename is not found, then Node.js will attempt to load the required filename with the added extensions: <code>.js</code>, <code>.json</code>, and finally <code>.node</code>.</p>\n<p><code>.js</code> files are interpreted as JavaScript text files, and <code>.json</code> files are parsed as JSON text files. <code>.node</code> files are interpreted as compiled addon modules loaded with <code>process.dlopen()</code>.</p>\n<p>A required module prefixed with <code>'/'</code> is an absolute path to the file. For example, <code>require('/home/marco/foo.js')</code> will load the file at <code>/home/marco/foo.js</code>.</p>\n<p>A required module prefixed with <code>'./'</code> is relative to the file calling <code>require()</code>. That is, <code>circle.js</code> must be in the same directory as <code>foo.js</code> for <code>require('./circle')</code> to find it.</p>\n<p>Without a leading <code>'/'</code>, <code>'./'</code>, or <code>'../'</code> to indicate a file, the module must either be a core module or is loaded from a <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p>\n<p>If the given path does not exist, <code>require()</code> will throw an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_class_error\"><code>Error</code></a> with its <code>code</code> property set to <code>'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'</code>.</p>\n<h3>Folders as modules<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_folders_as_modules\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It is convenient to organize programs and libraries into self-contained directories, and then provide a single entry point to those directories. There are three ways in which a folder may be passed to <code>require()</code> as an argument.</p>\n<p>The first is to create a <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_node_js_package_json_field_definitions\"><code>package.json</code></a> file in the root of the folder, which specifies a <code>main</code> module. An example <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_node_js_package_json_field_definitions\"><code>package.json</code></a> file might look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>{ \"name\" : \"some-library\",\n  \"main\" : \"./lib/some-library.js\" }\n</code></pre>\n<p>If this was in a folder at <code>./some-library</code>, then <code>require('./some-library')</code> would attempt to load <code>./some-library/lib/some-library.js</code>.</p>\n<p>This is the extent of the awareness of <code>package.json</code> files within Node.js.</p>\n<p>If there is no <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_node_js_package_json_field_definitions\"><code>package.json</code></a> file present in the directory, or if the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_main\"><code>\"main\"</code></a> entry is missing or cannot be resolved, then Node.js will attempt to load an <code>index.js</code> or <code>index.node</code> file out of that directory. For example, if there was no <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_node_js_package_json_field_definitions\"><code>package.json</code></a> file in the previous example, then <code>require('./some-library')</code> would attempt to load:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>./some-library/index.js</code></li>\n<li><code>./some-library/index.node</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If these attempts fail, then Node.js will report the entire module as missing with the default error:</p>\n<pre><code>Error: Cannot find module 'some-library'\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Loading from <code>node_modules</code> folders<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_node_modules_folders\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If the module identifier passed to <code>require()</code> is not a <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_core_modules\">core</a> module, and does not begin with <code>'/'</code>, <code>'../'</code>, or <code>'./'</code>, then Node.js starts at the parent directory of the current module, and adds <code>/node_modules</code>, and attempts to load the module from that location. Node.js will not append <code>node_modules</code> to a path already ending in <code>node_modules</code>.</p>\n<p>If it is not found there, then it moves to the parent directory, and so on, until the root of the file system is reached.</p>\n<p>For example, if the file at <code>'/home/ry/projects/foo.js'</code> called <code>require('bar.js')</code>, then Node.js would look in the following locations, in this order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/home/ry/projects/node_modules/bar.js</code></li>\n<li><code>/home/ry/node_modules/bar.js</code></li>\n<li><code>/home/node_modules/bar.js</code></li>\n<li><code>/node_modules/bar.js</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This allows programs to localize their dependencies, so that they do not clash.</p>\n<p>It is possible to require specific files or sub modules distributed with a module by including a path suffix after the module name. For instance <code>require('example-module/path/to/file')</code> would resolve <code>path/to/file</code> relative to where <code>example-module</code> is located. The suffixed path follows the same module resolution semantics.</p>\n<h3>Loading from the global folders<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If the <code>NODE_PATH</code> environment variable is set to a colon-delimited list of absolute paths, then Node.js will search those paths for modules if they are not found elsewhere.</p>\n<p>On Windows, <code>NODE_PATH</code> is delimited by semicolons (<code>;</code>) instead of colons.</p>\n<p><code>NODE_PATH</code> was originally created to support loading modules from varying paths before the current <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together\">module resolution</a> algorithm was defined.</p>\n<p><code>NODE_PATH</code> is still supported, but is less necessary now that the Node.js ecosystem has settled on a convention for locating dependent modules. Sometimes deployments that rely on <code>NODE_PATH</code> show surprising behavior when people are unaware that <code>NODE_PATH</code> must be set. Sometimes a module's dependencies change, causing a different version (or even a different module) to be loaded as the <code>NODE_PATH</code> is searched.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Node.js will search in the following list of GLOBAL_FOLDERS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1: <code>$HOME/.node_modules</code></li>\n<li>2: <code>$HOME/.node_libraries</code></li>\n<li>3: <code>$PREFIX/lib/node</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where <code>$HOME</code> is the user's home directory, and <code>$PREFIX</code> is the Node.js configured <code>node_prefix</code>.</p>\n<p>These are mostly for historic reasons.</p>\n<p>It is strongly encouraged to place dependencies in the local <code>node_modules</code> folder. These will be loaded faster, and more reliably.</p>\n<h3>The module wrapper<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_wrapper\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Before a module's code is executed, Node.js will wrap it with a function wrapper that looks like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {\n// Module code actually lives in here\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>By doing this, Node.js achieves a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It keeps top-level variables (defined with <code>var</code>, <code>const</code> or <code>let</code>) scoped to the module rather than the global object.</li>\n<li>\n<p>It helps to provide some global-looking variables that are actually specific to the module, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>module</code> and <code>exports</code> objects that the implementor can use to export values from the module.</li>\n<li>The convenience variables <code>__filename</code> and <code>__dirname</code>, containing the module's absolute filename and directory path.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The module scope<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_scope\">#</a></h3>\n<h4><code>__dirname</code><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_dirname\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Added in: v0.1.27</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type\"><string></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The directory name of the current module.

Sometimes this is not acceptable; many want their module to be an instance of some class. To do this, assign the desired export object to <code>module.exports</code>. Assigning the desired object to <code>exports</code> will simply rebind the local <code>exports</code> variable, which is probably not what is desired.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose we were making a module called <code>a.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const EventEmitter = require('events');\n\nmodule.exports = new EventEmitter();\n\n// Do some work, and after some time emit\n// the 'ready' event from the module itself.\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  module.exports.emit('ready');\n}, 1000);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then in another file we could do:</p>\n<pre><code>const a = require('./a');\na.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log('module \"a\" is ready');\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Assignment to <code>module.exports</code> must be done immediately. It cannot be done in any callbacks. This does not work:</p>\n<p><code>x.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>setTimeout(() => {\n  module.exports = { a: 'hello' };\n}, 0);\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>y.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const x = require('./x');\nconsole.log(x.a);\n</code></pre>\n<h5><code>exports</code> shortcut<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_exports_shortcut\">#</a></h5>\n<p>Added in: v0.1.16</p>\n<p>The <code>exports</code> variable is available within a module's file-level scope, and is assigned the value of <code>module.exports</code> before the module is evaluated.</p>\n<p>It allows a shortcut, so that <code>module.exports.f = ...</code> can be written more succinctly as <code>exports.f = ...</code>. However, be aware that like any variable, if a new value is assigned to <code>exports</code>, it is no longer bound to <code>module.exports</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>module.exports.hello = true; // Exported from require of module\nexports = { hello: false };  // Not exported, only available in the module\n</code></pre>\n<p>When the <code>module.exports</code> property is being completely replaced by a new object, it is common to also reassign <code>exports</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>module.exports = exports = function Constructor() {\n  // ... etc.\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>To illustrate the behavior, imagine this hypothetical implementation of <code>require()</code>, which is quite similar to what is actually done by <code>require()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>function require(/* ... */) {\n  const module = { exports: {} };\n  ((module, exports) => {\n    // Module code here. In this example, define a function.\n    function someFunc() {}\n    exports = someFunc;\n    // At this point, exports is no longer a shortcut to module.exports, and\n    // this module will still export an empty default object.\n    module.exports = someFunc;\n    // At this point, the module will now export someFunc, instead of the\n    // default object.\n  })(module, module.exports);\n  return module.exports;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4><code>module.filename</code><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_filename\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Added in: v0.1.16</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type\"><string></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fully resolved filename of the module.</p>\n<h4><code>module.id</code><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_id\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Added in: v0.1.16</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type\"><string></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The identifier for the module.

What should you know about it, and what are some of the cool things you can do with it?</p>\n<p>The package.json file is kind of a manifest for your project. It can do a lot of things, completely unrelated. It's a central repository of configuration for tools, for example. It's also where npm and yarn store the names and versions for all the installed packages.</p>\n<h2>The file structure</h2>\n<p>Here's an example package.json file:</p>\n<p>It's empty! There are no fixed requirements of what should be in a package.json file, for an application. The only requirement is that it respects the JSON format, otherwise it cannot be read by programs that try to access its properties programmatically.</p>\n<p>If you're building a Node.js package that you want to distribute over npm things change radically, and you must have a set of properties that will help other people use it. We'll see more about this later on.</p>\n<p>This is another package.json:</p>\n<p>It defines a name property, which tells the name of the app, or package, that's contained in the same folder where this file lives.</p>\n<p>Here's a much more complex example, which was extracted from a sample Vue.js application:</p>\n<p>there are <em>lots</em> of things going on here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>version indicates the current version</li>\n<li>name sets the application/package name</li>\n<li>description is a brief description of the app/package</li>\n<li>main set the entry point for the application</li>\n<li>private if set to true prevents the app/package to be accidentally published on npm</li>\n<li>scripts defines a set of node scripts you can run</li>\n<li>dependencies sets a list of npm packages installed as dependencies</li>\n<li>devDependencies sets a list of npm packages installed as development dependencies</li>\n<li>engines sets which versions of Node.js this package/app works on</li>\n<li>browserslist is used to tell which browsers (and their versions) you want to support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All those properties are used by either npm or other tools that we can use.</p>\n<h2>Properties breakdown</h2>\n<p>This section describes the properties you can use in detail. We refer to \"package\" but the same thing applies to local applications which you do not use as packages.</p>\n<p>Most of those properties are only used on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">https://www.npmjs.com/</a>, others by scripts that interact with your code, like npm or others.</p>\n<h3>name</h3>\n<p>Sets the package name.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>The name must be less than 214 characters, must not have spaces, it can only contain lowercase letters, hyphens (-) or underscores (_).</p>\n<p>This is because when a package is published on npm, it gets its own URL based on this property.</p>\n<p>If you published this package publicly on GitHub, a good value for this property is the GitHub repository name.</p>\n<h3>author</h3>\n<p>Lists the package author name</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Can also be used with this format:</p>\n<h3>contributors</h3>\n<p>As well as the author, the project can have one or more contributors. This property is an array that lists them.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Can also be used with this format:</p>\n<h3>bugs</h3>\n<p>Links to the package issue tracker, most likely a GitHub issues page</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>homepage</h3>\n<p>Sets the package homepage</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>version</h3>\n<p>Indicates the current version of the package.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>This property follows the semantic versioning (semver) notation for versions, which means the version is always expressed with 3 numbers: x.x.x.</p>\n<p>The first number is the major version, the second the minor version and the third is the patch version.</p>\n<p>There is a meaning in these numbers: a release that only fixes bugs is a patch release, a release that introduces backward-compatible changes is a minor release, a major release can have breaking changes.</p>\n<h3>license</h3>\n<p>Indicates the license of the package.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>keywords</h3>\n<p>This property contains an array of keywords that associate with what your package does.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>This helps people find your package when navigating similar packages, or when browsing the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">https://www.npmjs.com/</a> website.</p>\n<h3>description</h3>\n<p>This property contains a brief description of the package</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>This is especially useful if you decide to publish your package to npm so that people can find out what the package is about.</p>\n<h3>repository</h3>\n<p>This property specifies where this package repository is located.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Notice the github prefix. There are other popular services baked in:</p>\n<p>You can explicitly set the version control system:</p>\n<p>You can use different version control systems:</p>\n<h3>main</h3>\n<p>Sets the entry point for the package.</p>\n<p>When you import this package in an application, that's where the application will search for the module exports.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>private</h3>\n<p>if set to true prevents the app/package to be accidentally published on npm</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>scripts</h3>\n<p>Defines a set of node scripts you can run</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>These scripts are command line applications. You can run them by calling npm run XXXX or yarn XXXX, where XXXX is the command name. Example: npm run dev.</p>\n<p>You can use any name you want for a command, and scripts can do literally anything you want.</p>\n<h3>dependencies</h3>\n<p>Sets a list of npm packages installed as dependencies.</p>\n<p>When you install a package using npm or yarn:</p>\n<p>that package is automatically inserted in this list.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>devDependencies</h3>\n<p>Sets a list of npm packages installed as development dependencies.</p>\n<p>They differ from dependencies because they are meant to be installed only on a development machine, not needed to run the code in production.</p>\n<p>When you install a package using npm or yarn:</p>\n<p>that package is automatically inserted in this list.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>engines</h3>\n<p>Sets which versions of Node.js and other commands this package/app work on</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>browserslist</h3>\n<p>Is used to tell which browsers (and their versions) you want to support. It's referenced by Babel, Autoprefixer, and other tools, to only add the polyfills and fallbacks needed to the browsers you target.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>This configuration means you want to support the last 2 major versions of all browsers with at least 1% of usage (from the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\">CanIUse.com</a> stats), except IE8 and lower.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserslist\">see more</a>)</p>\n<h3>Command-specific properties</h3>\n<p>The package.json file can also host command-specific configuration, for example for Babel, ESLint, and more.</p>\n<p>Each has a specific property, like eslintConfig, babel and others. Those are command-specific, and you can find how to use those in the respective command/project documentation.</p>\n<h2>Package versions</h2>\n<p>You have seen in the description above version numbers like these: ~3.0.0 or ^0.13.0. What do they mean, and which other version specifiers can you use?</p>\n<p>That symbol specifies which updates your package accepts, from that dependency.</p>\n<p>Given that using semver (semantic versioning) all versions have 3 digits, the first being the major release, the second the minor release and the third is the patch release, you have these \"<a href=\"https://nodejs.dev/learn/semantic-versioning-using-npm/\">Rules</a>\".</p>\n<p>You can combine most of the versions in ranges, like this: 1.0.0 || >=1.1.0 &#x3C;1.2.0, to either use 1.0.0 or one release from 1.1.0 up, but lower than 1.2.0.</p>\n<h1>Cheat Sheet:</h1>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">/* *******************************************************************************************\n * SYNOPSIS\n * http://nodejs.org/api/synopsis.html\n * ******************************************************************************************* */\n\n\nvar http = require('http');\n\n// An example of a web server written with Node which responds with 'Hello World'.\n// To run the server, put the code into a file called example.js and execute it with the node program.\nhttp.createServer(function (request, response) {\n  response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n  response.end('Hello World\\n');\n}).listen(8124);\n\nconsole.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');\n\n\n/* *******************************************************************************************\n * GLOBAL OBJECTS\n * http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html\n * ******************************************************************************************* */\n\n\n// In browsers, the top-level scope is the global scope.\n// That means that in browsers if you're in the global scope var something will define a global variable.\n// In Node this is different.

Those do not exist in Node.js, of course. You don't have the <code>document</code>, <code>window</code> and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.</p>\n<p>And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, like the filesystem access functionality.</p>\n<p>Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment. Unless you are building an open source application that anyone can deploy anywhere, you know which version of Node.js you will run the application on.

Make sure you check it out as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Downloads</h2>\n<p><code>npm</code> manages downloads of dependencies of your project.</p>\n<h3>Installing all dependencies</h3>\n<p>If a project has a <code>package.json</code> file, by running</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install\n</code></pre>\n<p>it will install everything the project needs, in the <code>node_modules</code> folder, creating it if it's not existing already.</p>\n<h3>Installing a single package</h3>\n<p>You can also install a specific package by running</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install &#x3C;package-name>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Often you'll see more flags added to this command:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--save</code> installs and adds the entry to the <code>package.json</code> file <em>dependencies</em></li>\n<li><code>--save-dev</code> installs and adds the entry to the <code>package.json</code> file <em>devDependencies</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The difference is mainly that devDependencies are usually development tools, like a testing library, while <code>dependencies</code> are bundled with the app in production.</p>\n<h3>Updating packages</h3>\n<p>Updating is also made easy, by running</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">npm update\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>npm</code> will check all packages for a newer version that satisfies your versioning constraints.</p>\n<p>You can specify a single package to update as well:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">npm update &#x3C;package-name>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Versioning</h2>\n<p>In addition to plain downloads, <code>npm</code> also manages <strong>versioning</strong>, so you can specify any specific version of a package, or require a version higher or lower than what you need.</p>\n<p>Many times you'll find that a library is only compatible with a major release of another library.</p>\n<p>Or a bug in the latest release of a lib, still unfixed, is causing an issue.</p>\n<p>Specifying an explicit version of a library also helps to keep everyone on the same exact version of a package, so that the whole team runs the same version until the <code>package.json</code> file is updated.</p>\n<p>In all those cases, versioning helps a lot, and <code>npm</code> follows the semantic versioning (semver) standard.</p>\n<h2>Running Tasks</h2>\n<p>The package.json file supports a format for specifying command line tasks that can be run by using</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">npm run &#x3C;task-name>\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"start-dev\": \"node lib/server-development\",\n        \"start\": \"node lib/server-production\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's very common to use this feature to run Webpack:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"watch\": \"webpack --watch --progress --colors --config webpack.conf.js\",\n        \"dev\": \"webpack --progress --colors --config webpack.conf.js\",\n        \"prod\": \"NODE_ENV=production webpack -p --config webpack.conf.js\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So instead of typing those long commands, which are easy to forget or mistype, you can run</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ npm run watch\n$ npm run dev\n$ npm run prod\n</code></pre>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/npx/","relativePath":"docs/articles/npx.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"npx.md","name":"npx","frontmatter":{"title":"The

package</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>npx</code> lets you run code built with Node.js and published through the npm registry.</p>\n<h2>Easily run local commands</h2>\n<p>Node.js developers used to publish most of the executable commands as global packages, in order for them to be in the path and executable immediately.</p>\n<p>This was a pain because you could not really install different versions of the same command.</p>\n<p>Running <code>npx commandname</code> automatically finds the correct reference of the command inside the <code>node_modules</code> folder of a project, without needing to know the exact path, and without requiring the package to be installed globally and in the user's path.</p>\n<h2>Installation-less command execution</h2>\n<p>There is another great feature of <code>npx</code>, which is allowing to run commands without first installing them.</p>\n<p>This is pretty useful, mostly because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you don't need to install anything</li>\n<li>you can run different versions of the same command, using the syntax @version</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A typical demonstration of using <code>npx</code> is through the <code>cowsay</code> command. <code>cowsay</code> will print a cow saying what you wrote in the command. For example:</p>\n<p><code>cowsay \"Hello\"</code> will print</p>\n<pre><code> _______\n&#x3C; Hello >\n -------\n        \\   ^__^\n         \\  (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n</code></pre>\n<p>This only works if you have the <code>cowsay</code> command globally installed from npm previously. Otherwise you'll get an error when you try to run the command.</p>\n<p><code>npx</code> allows you to run that npm command without having it installed locally:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx cowsay \"Hello\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>will do the job.</p>\n<p>Now, this is a funny useless command.\nOther scenarios include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>running the <code>vue</code> CLI tool to create new applications and run them: <code>npx @vue/cli create my-vue-app</code></li>\n<li>creating a new React app using <code>create-react-app</code>: <code>npx create-react-app my-react-app</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>and many more.</p>\n<p>Once downloaded, the downloaded code will be wiped.</p>\n<h2>Run some code using a different Node.js version</h2>\n<p>Use the <code>@</code> to specify the version, and combine that with the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/node\"><code>node</code> npm package</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx node@10 -v #v10.18.1\nnpx node@12 -v #v12.14.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>This helps to avoid tools like <code>nvm</code> or the other Node.js version management tools.</p>\n<h2>Run arbitrary code snippets directly from a URL</h2>\n<p><code>npx</code> does not limit you to the packages published on the npm registry.</p>\n<p>You can run code that sits in a GitHub gist, for example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npx https://gist.github.com/zkat/4bc19503fe9e9309e2bfaa2c58074d32\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, you need to be careful when running code that you do not control, as with great power comes great responsibility.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/os-module/","relativePath":"docs/articles/os-module.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"os-module.md","name":"os-module","frontmatter":{"title":"OS-Module","sections":[],"seo":{"title":"","description":"OS-Module","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>This module provides many functions that you can use to retrieve information from the underlying operating system and the computer the program runs on, and interact with it.</h1>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const os = require('os');\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are a few useful properties that tell us some key things related to handling files:</p>\n<p><code>os.EOL</code> gives the line delimiter sequence.

They would choose the typeface, and in the early days even make the matrix and cast the type themselves. They would lay out the lines of text, choosing suitable spacing in each line, deciding where to break the line and adding hyphens to improve the overall look of the page while maintaining readability.

Other people became expert in how to best lay out pages, what visual design elements would best communicate the desired message etc. The type-setter still made the technical choices to achieve the desired goals, but didn't have to be an expert in design. The production of a printed document would involve a number of people who were expert in their given area, from author to visual designer to type-setter.</p>\n<p>This team based approach to document production means that each person can develop their own expertise and to a certain extent, doesn't need to worry about what the people later in the chain will do. The author doesn't worry about how to place figures or images in the page, just that they will be there; the designer doesn't need to be concerned about kerning and the use of em-spaces in type-setting; the type-setter isn't an expert in the content of the text. All can work together to produce a superior printed document.</p>\n<p>The world of document production worked like this for a long time until the invention of the personal computer and <em>Desktop Publishing</em> software. Suddenly, authors became designers and type-setters through easy to use computer software. They could choose fonts, set margins, force hyphenation and make minute decisions about the layout and look and feel of each page. Not surprisingly, this becomes a significant distraction from the task of creating content, but it also means that the expertise of the specialist designer or type-setter isn't used any more. This might lead to more productivity as the production process is compressed, but it doesn't usually lead to more readable, better presented documents; many of the early self-produced documents were an unsightly mix of fonts, colours and sizes.</p>\n<p>If we fast-forward to the software tools we have today for document production, it's interesting to note that the expertise of the designer and typesetter has crept back in to the process. Rather than being involved in the production of every document, these people are now able to write stylesheets and templates as well as contribute to the algorithms used in the software to lay out the text on a page. Most companies will have a standard document template that is used for reports or letters, this has usually been designed by a professional and all the author needs to do is enter the text in the right place. Stylesheets in word processors mean that there will be a consistency of font use throughout the document and importantly, that the decisions on which fonts and how they are used doesn't need to be made by the author.</p>\n<p>So, to summarise this little discussion of history, there have always been people who's expertise is the way that a text is rendered on the page. With the onset of desktop publishing software, there has been a tendency for the author to spend time in document design, meaning that the relevant expertise was not being applied. However, modern software now allows for the designer's voice to be heard again through the use of stylesheets and document templates. This leaves the author to concentrate on the text meaning they will be more productive and should produce better looking documents as well.</p>\n<h2>Web Document Production</h2>\n<p>Fundamentally, the web is a technology for delivering content to readers through a document based interface (the web browser). So, producing web content is a document production process and as such, should parallel the ideas discussed above. It's interesting to look at the development of HTML and see how it parallels the developments described above.</p>\n<p>Early HTML was a language for encoding content. It included tags for headings, paragraphs, lists etc. but didn't provide any way to change the way these things were rendered by the browser. The browser made sensible decisions and web documents all looked about the same. The focus was on the content. Soon, <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Projects/mosaic.html\">graphical browsers</a> started to appear that allowed images to be included in pages and people started to want to have some control over the appearance of their pages.</p>\n<p>The growth of the web into the commercial arena and the wider range of documents being published led to the 'browser wars' between Netscape and Microsoft. One of the features of this war was the arms race of features in each browser designed to make web pages look better. Each vendor would introduce new ways to control the look and feel of pages, for example the &#x3C;FONT> tag was introduced by Netscape to allow control of the font used to display text while Microsoft included the &#x3C;MARQUEE> tag that displayed text scrolling across the page. Eventually, some of these tags were standardised into a later version of HTML and were implemented by most of the browsers. These tags encouraged authors to get involved in page design, in fact they had to since the only way to control the appearance of a page was to insert codes into the text.</p>\n<p>While the &#x3C;FONT> tag allowed some control over the appearance of text, there was still a problem of laying out a page as a whole. The solution that became standard practice was to mis-use the &#x3C;TABLE> tag and construct the whole page as a table with rows and columns for the different page elements such as header, menu, content and footer. This worked really well, but again meant that the HTML code that an author was writing had to contain a lot of information about the layout of the page. In addition, it was common for people to mis-use tags just for the sake of appearance, for example to have more control over the appearance of headings, one might just encode them using &#x3C;B> or &#x3C;FONT> tags rather than header tags.</p>\n<p>All of these additions to HTML and the mis-use of existing tags meant that a language that was originally designed to allow authors to concentrate on content had turned into a page layout language. Luckily, sense has prevailed and we have now developed ways to control page layout without adding special instructions into the HTML code - that is, we have the Cascading Stylesheet language (CSS). Once again, we can let the author concentrate on content in HTML while all (or most) design decisions are encoded in the stylesheet.</p>\n<p>The current suite of web languages understood by your browser (HTML, CSS and Javascript) each serve different roles in the web development process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML - Content</li>\n<li>CSS - Style</li>\n<li>Javascript - Behaviour</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The third of these - Javascript and Behaviour - refer to the way that Javascript can be used to change the way that the user interacts with the page. This doesn't really have an analogue in the print document production world but it's an important aspect of modern web content production. It fits into this framework because the behavioural changes that Javascript can introduce should not be the concern of the content author or the visual designer (though both might have opinions on what they'd like to see).</p>\n<p>It is useful to think of these three aspects of web design as independent things. The same web content could be presented using alternate stylesheets and have a completely different impact. Similarly, Javascript can be used to change the way that a user interacts with content, making it more usable. We can see the Style and Behaviour aspects as layers that are applied to the core Content to enhance it for the user.</p>\n<h2>The Separation of Concerns</h2>\n<p>From a Computer Science/Software Engineering point of view there is a very important principle called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">Separation of Concerns</a> (SoC) that is illustrated perfectly by the way that the various web languages have evolved. The SoC principle is about partitioning the work that we do in software development into parts that can be considered separately. This is achieved by <em>modularisation</em> within a software project and is helped by things like classes and interface descriptions between modules</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in fact these things have been developed to support SoC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The SoC principle allows us to develop large complex software by allowing us to concentrate on different aspects of the solution. It could be that we do that alone, spending time on one aspect and then another, or as a team with different people assigned to different aspects. Either way, being able to work on part of the problem makes it manageable and improves the overall quality of the solution.</p>\n<p>In web development, the separation of concerns is supported by the different languages that work together to build a modern web application. It is important to recognise this and make sure that we use each of these tools in such a way as to respect their roles and capabilities. So, while it is possible to use HTML structures to make text large and bold for a heading, we don't, we use one of the header tags and rely on the stylesheet to apply the appropriate settings. Having the author respect good HTML usage means that the designer can make assumptions about the page structure in the stylesheet and ensure that the document appearance is consistent for the user.</p>\n<h2>Semantic HTML Markup</h2>\n<p>One corollary of this kind of thinking is that each component that we use should be used as it was designed and according to it's role in the overall picture. In particular for HTML this implies that the markup we use should encode only the <em>structure</em> of the document rather than aspects of the <em>appearance</em> which is properly dealt with using CSS. Further, this means that we should use markup in a way that imparts useful <em>meaning</em> to the document structure. This is generally known as using <em>Semantic HTML</em> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML\">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/posh\">POSH</a> on Microformats.org) and is the current best practice in HTML authoring.</p>\n<p>To clarify this point we can look at some examples. Writing semantic HTML means using the HTML tags as they were designed to be used - to convey the meaning of a particular document structure or textual element. So a good example is when we want to encode the main heading in a page I would use the H1 tag:</p>\n<p>This seems obvious, but in some cases, an author might decide that the default rendering of the H1 tag is too big, so rather than using CSS to define an alternate style, they use the H2 tag instead.</p>\n<p>This may seem harmless, after all we've still marked up this text as a heading. The problem is that we've lost the information that this is the main heading in the page that was conveyed by the H1 tag.</p>\n<p>Even worse, I could use the B (bold) tag and the now deprecated FONT tag to make my text look like a heading:</p>\n<p>In this case the appearance might be ok but the markup is not appropriate for the task. The author's focus has been on the appearance rather than the meaning of the markup; we could say that the author is overstepping their responsibilities a little - the appearance of the text should be the domain of the designer. If the heading is encoded as in this example, the designer will not be able to re-style the headings in a robust way (we could apply a style to bold paragraphs but that would also apply to any other use of this markup in the text).</p>\n<p>The example illustrates the importance of using an appropriate markup tag where one exists. In the case of a heading, this is pretty clear but other parts of the document might need a bit of thought to see what markup is appropriate. One common issue is whether to use a TABLE for some information that you want to appear as a list or array. TABLE is meant for data that has columns and rows, for example, the results of a survey or test scores for a class of students.</p>\n<p>While it is less common these days, the most frequent mis-use of tables is as a means of laying out all or part of a page as a rectangular grid. You may still see this in the navigation links on a page which the designer might want to appear in a row near the top of the page or a column down the side. Semantically this is a list and should really be marked up as such. If a table-like appearance is needed then CSS rules can be used to acheive this (eg. display: table-row).</p>\n<p>TABLE is sometimes used for things that might be more appropriately marked up as lists, eg. using UL (unordered list), OL (ordered list) or DL (description list) tags. An example might be the list of ingredients for a recipe; you might be tempted to encode it as a table because you want the quantities to be lined up in a column on the left. It might be appropriate to use TABLE here but a bit of reflection might tell you that it's really an unordered list - for example you might note that while there's usually a quantity for each ingredient it's not always the case ('salt to taste') so this isn't really columns of data, just list items that might have a distinguished field.</p>\n<p>A final example might be the description of a staff member in an online directory, the commonly contains entries for name, office, phone number, email address etc and it might seem natural to encode this as a table if you want a nice neat layout. However, in this case there is more appropriate markup in the DL (description list) tag. Each entry in a description list contains two parts DT (description title) and DD (description data) which are used to mark up the property name and value:</p>\n<p>Some authors are put off the description list because of the default style that is associated with it which puts the DT and DD parts on different lines. However, changing this is very easy with CSS so it really should be used for information that is structured in this way.</p>\n<p>Using the right semantic markup <em>adds</em> information to the text that can be used by the designer to enhance the communicative power of the web page. Using a consistent style for headings makes it easier for a reader to see the structure of a page and understand it. Similarly, I can use inline tags for things like <em>emphasis</em> (EM), Abbrv. (abbreviations, ABBR), “a quotation” (Q) or <strong>a strongly emphasised point</strong> (STRONG). Each of these has a default style (or in some cases like ABBR, is just the same as the default text style) but can be re-styled by the designer to achieve a particular look and feel. If these elements are used consistently throughout a text, the overall readability of the text can be greatly improved.</p>\n<p>Another motivation for using semantic markup is for users who cannot read via a normal web browser. Blind people make use software that reads out the content of a web page; if the page uses the appropriate semantic markup then the software can make use of this to present the content more appropriately to the user. This might include using the headings to provide a summary of the page or the emphasis tags to generate an appropriate intonation pattern. You might also think about the difference in reading out a list vs. a table of data - that might be a useful way of choosing between the two for a particular part of your page.</p>\n<h3>Exercises</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find an appropriate HTML tag to mark up the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the name of a book that you are citing in an essay</li>\n<li>a fragment of computer code, eg. a bit of Python</li>\n<li>an abbreviation or acronym and it's expansion (e.g. HTML - Hypertext Markup language)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Extending the Semantics of HTML</h2>\n<p>The tag set defined by the HTML standard supports a wide range of content and was designed to cover the most common document structures and entities that appear on the web. However, the designers of HTML couldn't forsee everything that you might want to mark in your documents and so an extension mechanism is included such that you can effectively add new semantics to existing tags. This is the HTML class attribute which allows you to enter a user defined class for any tag. It is effectively a specialisation of any tag that can be used to encode special meanings for your documents.</p>\n<p>The class attribute is meant to contain one or more class identifiers which are single words that mean something to your application. They can be applied to any HTML tag. An example might be the use of the class important to mark something as important in some way. I can add this to a paragraph or a list item:</p>\n<p>In this example, the class attribute is specialising the meaning of the main HTML tag so that we can differentiate important paragraphs and list items from others. We might want to do this so that we can highlight them in some way in the final presentation of the text. In this way, the designer can make the decision about how to emphasise this text (maybe differently on desktop and mobile devices) and the author is free just to decide which things are important. The alternative in this case might have been to use an emphasis EM tag around the text we wanted to emphasise. The advantage of the class attribute is that we identify the whole paragraph or list item as important and we are able to differentiate different kinds of emphasis. This might be useful where, for example, there are some things that are 'important' and others that are 'critical' in a set of instructions. The use of class attributes means that we can transfer the concepts that mean something in the domain of the document directly into the HTML code and then allow the designer to make decisions about how the different ideas are expressed visually.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there isn't an HTML tag that really fits what you are trying to express; in these cases you can use the generic DIV and SPAN tags along with a class attribute. For example, it has been common to use a series of DIV tags to denote the overall structure of a web page:</p>\n<p>This pattern allows the designer to write a stylesheet that places each section at the right place on the page with the right fonts, colours etc. This pattern has become so common that the new HTML5 standard has included new tags named after some of these classes, so you can now write:</p>\n<p>This is part of the evolution of the HTML language; the observation that some kinds of structure are being used very widely leading to the introduction of new elements that properly convey the semantics that are required.</p>\n<p>One final note about the use of classes to convey new semantics. It is possible to use more than one class name where that is appropriate to convey more specialisations. For example, all of the code examples in this text are marked up as PRE tags with the class code and another class to denote the language the code is written in, so on this page I have examples like:</p>\n<p>Note that I have to encode the HTML markup as entity references using the &#x26; notation so that they appear correctly when you view them in the web browser (view source to check this out). Having more than one class name means that I can apply standard styling to code examples and special style for different languages. It also means that I could write a script to pull out all of the examples in a given language if I wanted to check their syntax etc.</p>\n<h1>A View of HTML\n\n</h1>\n<p>Rather than being a chapter that will teach you the HTML language this will be a chapter about the language, how it works, why it has the structures it does and what you should and shouldn't do with it.</p>\n<p>Most people will know some HTML by now (assuming you've been studying computing for a while or have a general interest in the web). My task here is not to teach you HTML or act as a reference for the language, there are plenty of resources around that will do this. Some examples are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp\">w3schools HTML tutorial</a> w3schools is one of the most widely used tutorial and reference sites on the web for HTML and other web technologies.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/html\">Learn HTML</a> from the Mozilla Developer Network, the organisation that produces the Firefox browser. This page has pointers to a number of HTML tutorials and resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About HTML</h2>\n<p>HTML is a <em>markup language</em>, which is a formal language used to add encode structured documents, often by mixing formal elements and plain text. Another example is the LaTeX language used to typeset scientific and technical documents. Here's a fragment of LaTeX that shows the use of commands preceded by a backslash character and curly braces to enclose text:</p>\n<p>These commands are interpreted by the LaTeX system which uses then to produce nicely typeset PDF output. Markup can also be used to identify regions of text for analysis. Here's an example from a language corpus used to study human interaction:</p>\n<p>In this example, special character sequences are used to mark things like speaker turns, pauses, phrases and overlapping speech. This markup can be used to help analyse the language and find examples of certain linguistic phenomena (for example, find me examples of <em>'you know'</em> and show me what the next person says in response).</p>\n<p>HTML is the <em>Hypertext</em> Markup Language, meaning that it is designed to encode hypertext documents - that is, documents containing links to other documents on the World Wide Web. In fact, the hyperlink is just a small part of HTML and much more interesting are all the other parts of the language that allows us to produce useful documents for the web.</p>\n<p>HTML is based on an earlier standard called SGML (Standard Generalised Markup language) which had a successor called XML (eXtensible Markup Language). SGML and XML are both languages for defining markup languages, that is they define the syntax of a markup language but allow you to develop your own language for a specific purpose. The syntax is the angle brackets containing start and end tags &#x3C;p> and &#x3C;/p> that you will be familiar with (and a number of other rules). SGML and XML based languages all use this same syntax but allow the language designer to make up their own tags and define how they should be used together. HTML was designed originally by Tim Berners-Lee and later by the W3C as a language to encode pages of content for the web.</p>\n<p>Importantly, HTML is a <em>markup language</em> not a <em>programming language</em>. The job of a markup language is to record the structure of a document; that structure can then be interpreted by a program to generate some output. A programming language contains instructions that will be executed (or interpreted) to carry out some action or compute some result.</p>\n<h2>Versions of HTML</h2>\n<p>The first version of HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee as part of his World Wide Web project along with the HTTP protocol and the URL syntax. At first it was a very simple language for encoding articles and so had tags for headings, paragraphs, lists etc. Later, the language evolved to encompas new features in the browser such as the ability to display images, tables and modify the font that text was displayed in. The evolution of HTML has been quite gradual and at times part of intense competition between browser vendors (look up the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\">Browser Wars</a> to get the full story). The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and later the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) tried to standardise the language but it took some time for industry practice to align with the W3C standards. Luckily now we are in a period of relative stability where the standards process aligns well with what the major browsers are able to understand.</p>\n<p>A version of HTML is defined by a Document Type Definintion (DTD) - a formal definition of the allowed tags and attributes and the allowed structure of an HTML document. The DTD says that you can have a &#x3C;p> tag and that it can contain a &#x3C;strong> tag but that a &#x3C;li> has to be inside a &#x3C;ul> or &#x3C;ol> tag and so on. If a document conforms to the DTD (follows the rules) we say that it is <em>valid</em>, if it contains errors such as having an unknown tag or a tag in the wrong place it is invalid.</p>\n<p>Early versions of HTML were subject to a lot of change and it wasn't until HTML version 4.0.1, released in 1999 that there was a bit of stability in the language and consensus about what should be included and what should be left out. Before then, HTML had grown to contain a lot of <em>visual</em> markup that had been developed by the browser vendors (Netscape and Microsoft) to try to make their browser look better than the competition. An example is the &#x3C;font> tag introduced by Microsoft (and copied by Netscape) which could change the font used to render some text. By the time HTML 4.01 was published, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were becoming more widely adopted and the use of markup that explicitly referred to the visual appearance of the content was discouraged.</p>\n<p>HTML 4.0.1 is still the latest version of the official W3C standard although there have been a large number of changes implemented by the browser vendors since the time it was released.</p>\n<p>In 1997 the XML standard was introduced. XML was intended to generalise the use of markup on the web and allow developers to design thier own markup languages for specific purposes. XML is an evolution of the earlier SGML standard on which HTML had been based; it simplified the syntax rules a lot and made it easier to write parsers for XML. One of the early applications of XML was to develop XHTML - a version of HTML converted to adhere to the XML standard. XHTML 1.0 retained almost all of the tags in HTML 4.0.1 but introduced the constraints of XML. For example in an XML document every opening tag must have a corresponding close tag; in HTML, many close tags are optional (e.g. you can leave out the closing &#x3C;p> tag for a paragraph since it is implied by the next opening &#x3C;p> tag) and many tags never have a close tag because they never contain any text (e.g. &#x3C;img> or &#x3C;br>). In XHTML then, paragraphs always require a close tag and empty tags are written with the new XML syntax: &#x3C;br />.</p>\n<p>One of the motivations for introducing XHTML was to try to encourage web developers to adhere more closely to the published standards. The web had grown up with a culture of view-source where people would learn how to encode web pages by looking at the source HTML of other web pages rather than by reading the standard. They would then write their own pages and if they looked ok in the browser, they would publish them. To cope with the amount of badly formed HTML content on the web, the browser vendors built thier HTML parsers to be very forgiving. If you put a paragraph inside an image tag or a header inside a paragraph it would have a go at rendering the content. As a consequence, very few web publishers cared about generating proper HTML and anyone who wanted to parse web content had to make very few assumptions about HTML structure.</p>\n<p>Around this time there was a move towards having more automated clients consuming web content. One group was the search engine developers who were just interested in the textual content of pages but other groups were trying to glean real data from the web. For example, price comparison services were starting up which tried to extract pricing information from store listings. Other services might try to find event information from web pages. All of these services needed to parse the HTML structure and had problems when the HTML was badly structured; this became known as <a href=\"http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/whatIsTagSoup\">Tag Soup</a> since one could not rely on proper HTML structure it was just treated as an unstructured collection of tagged text. Permissive parsers such as <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/\">Beautiful Soup</a> (Python) and <a href=\"http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/\">Tagsoup</a> (Java) were developed to cope with the messy markup and give the developer as much detail as possible from the page.</p>\n<h1>HTML5</h1>\n<p>The most recent version of HTML is HTML5 - note the name with no spaces which is quite different to earlier versions. HTML5 was a big change in the way that the standard was put together and followed a long break in the development of standards for HTML: HTML 4.0.1 was last updated in 2000, HTML5 was finally released in 2012. The goal of HTML5 was to standardise current practice in browsers, rather than to define new structures or limit what was possible. The W3C worked with the browser developers to agree on standards for new technologies that they had introduced. For example, being able to include audio and video elements in HTML had been possible in some browsers; HTML5 defined a standard for these that all browser vendors could agree on and implement.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/semantic/","relativePath":"docs/articles/semantic.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"semantic.md","name":"semantic","frontmatter":{"title":"Semantic Versioning","sections":[],"seo":{"title":"","description":"Semantic Versioning using npm","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>If there's one great thing in Node.js packages, it's that they all agreed on using Semantic Versioning for their version numbering.</p>\n<p>The Semantic Versioning concept is simple: all versions have 3 digits: <code>x.y.z</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the first digit is the major version</li>\n<li>the second digit is the minor version</li>\n<li>the third digit is the patch version</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you make a new release, you don't just up a number as you please, but you have rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you up the major version when you make incompatible API changes</li>\n<li>you up the minor version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner</li>\n<li>you up the patch version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The convention is adopted all across programming languages, and it is very important that every <code>npm</code> package adheres to it, because the whole system depends on that.</p>\n<p>Why is that so important?</p>\n<p>Because <code>npm</code> set some rules we can use in the <code>package.json</code> file to choose which versions it can update our packages to, when we run <code>npm update</code>.</p>\n<p>The rules use those symbols:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>^</code></li>\n<li><code>~</code></li>\n<li><code>></code></li>\n<li><code>>=</code></li>\n<li><code>&#x3C;</code></li>\n<li><code>&#x3C;=</code></li>\n<li><code>=</code></li>\n<li><code>-</code></li>\n<li><code>||</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's see those rules in detail:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>^</code>: It will only do updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero number.

Other <em>schemes</em> are allowed and they tell the client how to get access to the content that the URL describes. The most common you will see is https:// which is the secure variant of HTTP (we'll find out about that later). HTTPS uses the same protocol as HTTP but over a secure connection so that information that is exchanged can't be intercepted. Another scheme is ftp:// which tells the browser to use the older FTP protocol to access the content. Finally, you might see a mailto URL which allows us to write a link that triggers the browser to start composing an email message. This has a slightly different form: <a href=\"mailto:Steve.Cassidy@mq.edu.au\">Steve.Cassidy@mq.edu.au</a> but it's still a URL. In fact, the pattern looks like this:</p>\n<p>For the HTTP scheme the pattern is:</p>\n<p>The first part &#x3C;net_loc> is the network location of the resource: the domain name of the web server that holds the web page we want. This is preceded by two forward slashes and followed by a single forward slash. Then follows the &#x3C;path> which the server will use to identify which page we want. The ;&#x3C;params>?&#x3C;query>#&#x3C;fragment> are used to further qualify the resource that we want; we'll see some examples of how they are used later in the book.</p>\n<p>The URL is a unique form of identifier in that it has two roles. First, it identifies a document, video or music file that's out on the web (we call these things <em>resources</em>). Each resource has a unique URL and you can refer to them via the URL. If we two people refer to the same URL, then they know they have read the same document. Secondly, the URL contains enough information for a web client to retrieve a copy of the resource. The client can use the scheme defined (HTTP) to connect to the server and send an HTTP request for the path part of the URL.</p>\n<p>There are other kinds of formal identifier that don't have this second property. For example, every book has an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) which uniquely identifies it. However, the ISBN contains no information about how to get a copy of the book. To do so, you'd need to look up the ISBN in a catalogue which might tell you who the publisher was and then contact them for a copy. Alternately you could go to a book-shop or library and use their catalogue to find the book. With a URL, there's no need for a catalogue or third party service to decode the identifier. The information on how to retrieve the resource is right there in the Uniform Resource Locator.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/\">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> is as close as we get to a governing body for the Internet and it's home to many of the standards that define how the Internet and the Web work. The standards documents are called <em>Request for Comments</em> or RFC, a name which reflects the democratic nature of the early Internet. <a href=\"http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2068/\">RFC2068</a> defines HTTP version 1.1 and <a href=\"http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc1738/\">RFC1738</a> defines the URL. Look out also for <a href=\"http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2324/\">RFC2324</a> which can be relevant after a long coding session.</p>\n<h2>Uniform Resource Identifiers</h2>\n<p>There's another similar term that is sometimes used instead of URL: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). URI is actually a more general term that includes URLs and Universal Resource Names (URNs). URNs are identifiers that don't contain any locator information such as the ISBN. They have a formal syntax so I can cite a particular ISBN as a URN as URN:ISBN:978-0-395-36341-6 (an example from the <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3187bis-isbn-urn-01\">IETF RFC3187</a> document that defines the standard). As explained above, we need a third party service to resolve a URN into a real location (a URL). You might see the term URI used in discussions of web technologies; it is often used instead of URL but generally means the same thing if we're talking about HTTP based services.</p>\n<p>Since URLs are both names and addresses it becomes important that once you put a resource on the web, it stays there. This is discussed in Tim Berners-Lee's paper called \"<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI\">Cool URIs don't change</a>\". It's a principle that all web designers should bear in mind as it is easy to violate as we re-build old web-sites.</p>\n<h2>Absolute and relative URLs</h2>\n<p>When we include a URL in a web page there are a number of choices about how it can be written. The first option is to include the full URL:</p>\n<p>This is clearly a link to a resource on the server at <em>example.org</em> using the http protocol. However, if this page is being served by the server at <em>example.org</em> then we could also write this link as:</p>\n<p>This is known as a <em>relative URL</em> and is interpreted relative to the URL of the page that is currently being viewed. Let's assume that this page is at the URL <a href=\"http://example.org/about/info.html\">http://example.org/about/info.html</a>. Note that the URL above starts with a / character, in this case, the browser will interpret this URL by adding the protocol (http) and domain (example.org) parts of the page URL to this one to get <a href=\"http://example.org/static/style.css\">http://example.org/static/style.css</a>.</p>\n<p>Another way to write a URL is:</p>\n<p>In this case there is no / at the start of the URL and so this is interpreted relative to the page URL by removing everything but the last part of the URL <a href=\"http://example.org/about/\">http://example.org/about/</a> and then adding the new URL text to get <a href=\"http://example.org/about/static/style.css\">http://example.org/about/static/style.css</a>. Note that this is different to the previous example. If the intention was to reference the same URL as before, you could use the URL:</p>\n<p>Here the .. path refers to the parent directory (thinking of these paths as filenames) so the path becomes /about/../static/style.css which can be shortened to /static/style.css.</p>\n<p>The different URL styles have different uses. If you are writing a static HTML page that you will view on your local computer and perhaps host on the web somewhere (but you're not sure where) then you might put all of your files in one directory and use a relative URL like static/style.css to refer to linked resources. This ensures that your directory of files could be dropped anywhere into a web server file system and it would be self-contained and the links would work.</p>\n<p>However, if you are writing a web application that will be hosted on some domain (like example.org) you know that you have control of all URLs on that site and so would more likely use a relative URL starting with a / (like /static/style.css). This is important if your web application has complex routes (eg. pages like /users/steve/profile/edit) and you want to ensure that whatever the page URL being served, the links to stylesheets and other resources will work. The application can be deployed on different servers (like example.org and example.com) and the links will still work because they don't mention the domain name at all.</p>\n<p>Finally, absolute URLs (like <a href=\"http://example.org/static/style.css\">http://example.org/static/style.css</a>) will be used when we know that this URL is fixed at this location. It may be something external to our own site, or something that we know will be hosted at this URL on our site. There is an argument from a Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) viewpoint that all URLs in a website should be absolute urls even when they refer to assets on the same site. The reasons relate to the way that search engines crawl sites and the possible duplication of content if two URLs point to the same page (eg. <a href=\"https://example.org/\">https://example.org/</a> and <a href=\"http://example.org\">http://example.org</a>).</p>\n<p>One final form of relative URL looks like this:</p>\n<p>This URL is only missing the protocol part and is turned into an absolute URL by adding the protocol part of the current page URL. So if the current page was requested over http or https, this URL will use the same protocol. This is often useful if a site can be served over both protocols although it is increasingly the case that https is being used everywhere so this may become less common as time progresses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/\">Share To Facebook:</a></p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/understanding-firebase/","relativePath":"docs/articles/understanding-firebase.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"understanding-firebase.md","name":"understanding-firebase","frontmatter":{"title":"Firebase","weight":0,"excerpt":"Firebasics","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>Understand Firebase projects</h1>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're using the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest?authuser=0\">Firebase Management REST API</a> to programmatically create a Firebase project, you must first <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects?authuser=0\">create a Google Cloud project</a>, then <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects/addFirebase?authuser=0\">add Firebase services</a> to the existing project.<strong>Note:</strong> The <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-number\">project number</a> and the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-id\">project ID</a> are the truly <em>unique identifiers</em> for a project across all of Firebase and Google Cloud.<strong>After Firebase provisions resources for a Firebase project, you cannot change its project ID.</strong> To use a specific identifier for Firebase resources, you must edit the project ID during the initial creation of the project.<strong>Caution:</strong> We do not recommend manually modifying an app's Firebase config file or object.

In a project, you create Firebase apps by registering your iOS, Android, or web apps. After you register your apps with Firebase, you can add the Firebase SDKs for any number of <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/?authuser=0\">Firebase products</a>, like Analytics, Cloud Firestore, Performance Monitoring, or Remote Config.</p>\n<p>Learn more detailed information about this process in the Getting Started guides (<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup?authuser=0\">iOS</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?authuser=0\">Android</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0\">web</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup?authuser=0\">Unity</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup?authuser=0\">C++</a>).</p>\n<h2>Relationship between Firebase projects and Google Cloud</h2>\n<p>When you create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console, you're actually creating a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/?authuser=0#projects\">Google Cloud project</a> behind the scenes. You can think of a Google Cloud project as a virtual container for data, code, configuration, and services. <strong>A Firebase project is a Google Cloud project that has additional Firebase-specific configurations and services.</strong> You can even create a Google Cloud project first, then add Firebase to the project later.</p>\n<p>Since a Firebase project <strong><em>is</em></strong> a Google Cloud project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects that appear in the <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/?authuser=0\">Firebase console</a> also appear in the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/?authuser=0#google-cloud-console\">Google Cloud Console</a> and <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/?authuser=0\">Google APIs console</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/pricing/?authuser=0\">Billing</a> and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/iam/overview?authuser=0\">permissions</a> for projects are shared across Firebase and Google Cloud.</li>\n<li>Unique identifiers for a project (like the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-number\">project number</a> and the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-id\">project ID</a>) are shared across Firebase and Google Cloud.</li>\n<li>You can use products and APIs from both Firebase and Google Cloud in a project.</li>\n<li>Deleting a project deletes it across Firebase and Google Cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting up a Firebase project and registering apps</h2>\n<p>You can set up a Firebase project and register apps in the <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/?authuser=0\">Firebase console</a> (or, for advanced use cases, via the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest?authuser=0\">Firebase Management REST API</a> or the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#management-commands\">Firebase CLI</a>). When you set up a project and register apps, you need to make some organizational decisions and add Firebase-specific configuration information to your local projects.</p>\n<p>Make sure to review some <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#best-practices\">general project-level best practices</a> (at the bottom of this page) before setting up a project and registering apps.</p>\n<h3>The project name</h3>\n<p>When you create a project, you provide a <strong>project name</strong>. This identifier is the <em>internal-only name</em> for a project in the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#manage-console\">Firebase console</a>, the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/?authuser=0#google-cloud-console\">Google Cloud Console</a>, and the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#manage-cli\">Firebase CLI</a>. The project name is not exposed in any publicly visible Firebase or Google Cloud product, service, or resource; it simply serves to help you more easily distinguish among multiple projects.</p>\n<p>You can edit a project name at any time in the settings <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/?authuser=0\"><strong>Project settings</strong></a> of the Firebase console. The project name is displayed in the top pane.</p>\n<h3>The project number</h3>\n<p>A Firebase project (and its <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#firebase-cloud-relationship\">associated Google Cloud project</a>) has a <strong>project number</strong>. This is the Google-assigned globally unique canonical identifier for the project. Use this identifier when configuring integrations and/or making API calls to Firebase, Google, or third-party services.</p>\n<h4>API calls and the project number</h4>\n<p>For many API calls, you need to include a unique identifier for a project. Although many APIs accept the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-id\">project ID</a>, it's recommended that you use the <strong>project number</strong> for making API calls to Firebase, Google, or third-party services.</p>\n<p>Learn more about using project identifiers, especially the project number, in Google's <a href=\"https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510\">AIP 2510 standard</a>.</p>\n<h4>Find the project number</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Firebase console: Click settings <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/?authuser=0\"><strong>Project settings</strong></a>.

This is a user-defined unique identifier for the project across all of Firebase and Google Cloud. When you create a Firebase project, Firebase automatically assigns a unique ID to the project, but you can edit it during project setup. This identifier should generally be treated as a convenience alias to reference the project.</p>\n<p>If you delete a project, the project ID is also deleted and can never be used again by any other project.</p>\n<h4>Firebase resources and the project ID</h4>\n<p>The project ID displays in publicly visible Firebase resources, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default Hosting subdomain — <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>.web.app and <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>.firebaseapp.com</li>\n<li>Default Realtime Database URL — <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com or <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>-default-rtdb.<strong>REGION_CODE</strong>.firebasedatabase.app</li>\n<li>Default Cloud Storage bucket name — <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>.appspot.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all of the aforementioned resources, you can create non-default instances. The publicly visible names of non-defaults are fully-customizable. You can <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/custom-domain?authuser=0\">connect custom domains</a> to a Firebase-hosted site, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/sharding?authuser=0\">shard the Realtime Database</a>, and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage?authuser=0\">create multiple Cloud Storage buckets</a> (visit the platform-specific Get Started page).</p>\n<h4>The Firebase CLI and the project ID</h4>\n<p>For some use cases, you might have multiple Firebase projects associated with the same local app directory. In these situations, when you use the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#manage-cli\">Firebase CLI</a>, you need to pass the --project flag with the firebase commands to communicate which Firebase project you want to interact with.</p>\n<p>You can also set up a <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#project_aliases\">project alias</a> for each Firebase project so that you don't have to remember project IDs.</p>\n<h4>API calls and the project ID</h4>\n<p>For many API calls, you need to include a unique identifier for a project. Although many APIs accept the project ID, it's recommended that you use the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-number\"><strong>project number</strong></a> for making API calls to Firebase, Google, or third-party services.</p>\n<p>Learn more about using project identifiers, especially the project number, in Google's <a href=\"https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510\">AIP 2510 standard</a>.</p>\n<h4>Find the project ID</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Firebase console: Click settings <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/?authuser=0\"><strong>Project settings</strong></a>.

The configuration includes \"Firebase options\", which are parameters required by Firebase and Google services to communicate with Firebase server APIs and to associate client data with the Firebase project and Firebase app. Here are the required, minimum \"Firebase options\":</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys?authuser=0\"><strong>API key</strong></a>: a simple encrypted string used when calling certain APIs that don't need to access private user data (example value: AIzaSyDOCAbC123dEf456GhI789jKl012-MnO)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-id\"><strong>Project ID</strong></a>: a user-defined unique identifier for the project across all of Firebase and Google Cloud. This identifier may appear in URLs or names for some Firebase resources, but it should generally be treated as a convenience alias to reference the project. (example value: myapp-project-123)</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Application ID (\"AppID\")</strong>: the unique identifier for the Firebase app across all of Firebase with a platform-specific format:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firebase iOS apps: GOOGLE<em>APP</em>ID (example value: 1:1234567890:ios:321abc456def7890)\nThis is <em>not</em> an Apple bundle ID.</li>\n<li>Firebase Android apps: mobilesdk<em>app</em>id (example value: 1:1234567890:android:321abc456def7890)\nThis is <em>not</em> an Android package name or Android application ID.</li>\n<li>Firebase Web apps: appId (example value: 1:65211879909:web:3ae38ef1cdcb2e01fe5f0c)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The content of the Firebase config file or object is considered public, including the app's platform-specific ID (iOS bundle ID or Android package name) and the Firebase project-specific values, like the API Key, project ID, Realtime Database URL, and Cloud Storage bucket name. Given this, <strong>use Firebase Security Rules</strong> to protect your data and files in <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security?authuser=0\">Realtime Database</a>, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started?authuser=0\">Cloud Firestore</a>, and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security?authuser=0\">Cloud Storage</a>.</p>\n<p>For open source projects, we generally do not recommend including the app's Firebase config file or object in source control because, in most cases, your users should create their own Firebase projects and point their apps to their own Firebase resources (via their own Firebase config file or object).</p>\n<h2>Managing a Firebase project</h2>\n<p>Make sure to review the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#best-practices\">general project-level best practices</a> (at the bottom of this page) for considerations that might affect how you manage a Firebase project.</p>\n<h3>Tools to manage a project</h3>\n<h4>Firebase console</h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/?authuser=0\">Firebase console</a> offers the richest environment for managing Firebase products, apps, and project-level settings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/images/firebase_console_overview.png?authuser=0\"></p>\n<p>The left-side panel of the console lists the Firebase products, organized by top-level categories. At the top of the left-side panel, access a project's settings by clicking settings. A project's settings include <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/integrations?authuser=0\">integrations</a>, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/iam/overview?authuser=0\">access permissions</a>, and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/pricing?authuser=0\">billing</a>.</p>\n<p>The middle of the console displays buttons that launch setup workflows to register various types of apps. After you start using Firebase, the main area of the console changes into a dashboard that displays stats on the products you use.</p>\n<h4>Firebase CLI (a command line tool)</h4>\n<p>Firebase also offers the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0\">Firebase CLI</a> for configuring and managing specific Firebase products, like Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions for Firebase.</p>\n<p>After installing the CLI, you have access to the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#command_reference\">global firebase command</a>. Use the CLI to <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#initialize_a_firebase_project\">link your local app directory to a Firebase project</a>, then <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#deployment\">deploy</a> new versions of Firebase-hosted content or updates to functions.</p>\n<h4>Firebase Management REST API</h4>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest?authuser=0\">Firebase Management REST API</a>, you can programmatically manage a Firebase project. For example, you can programmatically register an app with a project or list the apps that are already registered (<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.iosApps?authuser=0#methods\">iOS</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.androidApps?authuser=0#methods\">Android</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.webApps?authuser=0#methods\">web</a>).</p>\n<h2>General best practices</h2>\n<h3>Adding apps to a project</h3>\n<p><strong>Ensure that all apps within a project are platform variants of the same application</strong> from an end-user perspective. It's advisable to register the iOS, Android, and web versions of the same app or game with the same Firebase project. All the apps in a project generally share the same Firebase resources (database, storage buckets, etc.).</p>\n<p>If you have <strong><em>multiple build variants</em></strong> with different iOS bundle IDs or Android package names defined, you can register each variant with a separate Firebase project. However, if you have variants that share the <em>same</em> Firebase resources, register them with the <em>same</em> Firebase project.</p>\n<p>Here are some general limits for Firebase projects, apps, and sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of projects per account</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spark pricing plan — Project-creation quota is limited to a lower count of projects (usually around 5-10).</li>\n<li>Blaze pricing plan — Project-creation quota per account increases substantially as long as the associated Cloud Billing account is in good standing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The limit on project-creation quota is rarely a concern for most developers, but if needed, you can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6330231?authuser=0\">request an increase in project quota</a>.</p>\n<p>Be aware that the complete deletion of a project requires 30 days and counts toward project quota until the project is fully deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of apps per project</strong></p>\n<p>Firebase restricts the total number of Firebase Apps within a Firebase project to 30.</p>\n<p>You should ensure that all Firebase Apps within a single Firebase project are platform variants of the same application from an end-user perspective.

Multi-tenancy can lead to serious configuration and data privacy concerns problems, including unintended issues with analytics aggregation, shared authentication, overly-complex database structures, and difficulties with security rules.</p>\n<p>Generally, <strong>if a set of apps don't share the same data and configurations, strongly consider registering each app with a different Firebase project.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, if you develop a white label application, each independently labelled app should have its own Firebase project, but the iOS and Android versions of that label can be in the same project. Each independently labeled app shouldn't (for privacy reasons) share data with the others.</p>\n<h2>Launching your app</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/avoid-surprise-bills?authuser=0#set-up-budget-alert-emails\">budget alerts</a> for your project in the Google Cloud Console.</li>\n<li>Monitor the <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/usage?authuser=0\"><em>Usage and billing</em> dashboard</a> in the Firebase console to get an overall picture of your project's usage across multiple Firebase services.</li>\n<li>Review the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/launch-checklist?authuser=0\">Firebase launch checklist</a>.</li>\n</ul>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/v8/","relativePath":"docs/articles/v8.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"v8.md","name":"v8","frontmatter":{"title":"npm global or local packages","weight":0,"excerpt":"npm packages","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>The main difference between local and global packages is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>local packages</strong> are installed in the directory where you run npm install &#x3C;package-name>, and they are put in the node_modules folder under this directory</li>\n<li><strong>global packages</strong> are all put in a single place in your system (exactly where depends on your setup), regardless of where you run npm install -g &#x3C;package-name></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In your code you can only require local packages:</p>\n<p>so when should you install in one way or another?</p>\n<p>In general, <strong>all packages should be installed locally</strong>.</p>\n<p>This makes sure you can have dozens of applications in your computer, all running a different version of each package if needed.</p>\n<p>Updating a global package would make all your projects use the new release, and as you can imagine this might cause nightmares in terms of maintenance, as some packages might break compatibility with further dependencies, and so on.</p>\n<p>All projects have their own local version of a package, even if this might appear like a waste of resources, it's minimal compared to the possible negative consequences.</p>\n<p>A package <strong>should be installed globally</strong> when it provides an executable command that you run from the shell (CLI), and it's reused across projects.</p>\n<p>You can also install executable commands locally and run them using npx, but some packages are just better installed globally.</p>\n<p>Great examples of popular global packages which you might know are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>npm</li>\n<li>create-react-app</li>\n<li>vue-cli</li>\n<li>grunt-cli</li>\n<li>mocha</li>\n<li>react-native-cli</li>\n<li>gatsby-cli</li>\n<li>forever</li>\n<li>nodemon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You probably have some packages installed globally already on your system.

For some, it is '<em>table-free sites</em>', for others it is '<em>using valid code</em>'. However, web standards are much broader than that.

Quality of code</h3>\n<h4>1.1 Does the site use a correct Doctype?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A doctype (short for 'document type declaration') informs the validator which version of (X)HTML you're using, and must appear at the very top of every web page. Doctypes are a key component of compliant web pages: your markup and CSS won't validate without them.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/doctype/\">Fix your site with the right doctype</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html\">http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/about-boxmodel.htm\">http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/about-boxmodel.htm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gutfeldt.ch/matthias/articles/doctypeswitch.html\">http://gutfeldt.ch/matthias/articles/doctypeswitch.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2 Does the site use a Character set?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a user agent (eg. a browser) is unable to detect the character encoding used in a Web document, the user may be presented with unreadable text. This information is particularly important for those maintaining and extending a multilingual site, but  declaring the character encoding of the document is important for anyone producing XHTML/HTML or CSS.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/\">Tutorial: Character sets &#x26; encodings in XHTML, HTML and CSS</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/International/O-charset.html\">Character encodings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3 Does the site use Valid (X)HTML?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Valid code will render faster than code with errors. Valid code will render better than invalid code.

Specifically, the HTML code tends to be full of unnecessary divs and ids. This results in fairly meaningless HTML and bloated style sheets.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.clagnut.com/blog/228/\">Markup tactics</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>1.7 Is the code well structured?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Semantically correct markup uses html elements for their given purpose.

This is available under 'Internet Options' on the Advanced tab. Uncheck 'Disable script debugging'.</p>\n<h3>2. Degree of separation between content and presentation</h3>\n<h4>2.1 Does the site use CSS for all presentation aspects (fonts, colour, padding, borders etc)?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use style sheets to control layout and presentation</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-style-sheets\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 -- checkpoint 3.3</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>2.2 Are all decorative images in the CSS, or do they appear in the (X)HTML?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The aim for web developers is to remove all presentation from the html code, leaving it clean and semantically correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Accessibility for users</h3>\n<h4>3.1 Are \"alt\" attributes used for all descriptive images?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-text-equivalent\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines -- checkpoint 1.1</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>3.2 Does the site use relative units rather than absolute units for text size?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language attribute values and style sheet property values'</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-relative-units\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines -- checkpoint 3.4</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-relative-units\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines -- checkpoint 3.4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.clagnut.com/blog/348/\">How to size text using ems</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.3 Do any aspects of the layout break if font size is increased?</h4>\n<p>Try this simple test. Look at your website in a browser that supports easy incrementation of font size. Now increase your browser's font size. And again. And again... Look at your site. Does the page layout still hold together? It is dangerous for developers to assume that everyone browses using default font sizes.</p>\n<h4>3.4 Does the site use visible skip menus?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&#x26;ID=12\">Section 508</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS/#tech-group-links\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines -- checkpoint 13.6</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...blind visitors are not the only ones inconvenienced by too many links in a navigation area.

Accessibility for devices</h3>\n<h4>4.1 Does the site work acceptably across modern and older browsers?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before starting to build a CSS-based layout, you should decide which browsers to support and to what level you intend to support them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>4.2 Is the content accessible with CSS switched off or not supported?</h4>\n<p>Some people may visit your site with either a browser that does not support CSS or a browser with CSS switched off. In content is structured well, this will not be an issue.</p>\n<h4>4.3 Is the content accessible with images switched off or not supported?</h4>\n<p>Some people browse websites with images switched off -- especially people on very slow connections. Content should still be accessible for these people.</p>\n<h4>4.4 Does the site work in text browsers such as Lynx?</h4>\n<p>This is like a combination of images and CSS switched off. A text-based browser will rely on well structured content to provide meaning.</p>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview\">Lynx Viewer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5 Does the site work well when printed?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can take any (X)HTML document and simply style it for print, without having to touch the markup.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/\">Going to print</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.d.umn.edu/itss/support/Training/Online/webdesign/css.html#print\">Web Design References -- Print</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.6 Does the site work well in Hand Held devices?</h4>\n<p>This is a hard one to deal with until hand held devices consistently support their correct media type. However, some layouts work better in current hand-held devices. The importance of supporting hand held devices will depend on target audiences.</p>\n<h4>4.7 Does the site include detailed metadata?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metadata is machine understandable information for the web</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Metadata/\">W3C -- Metadata and Resource Description</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Metadata is structured information that is created specifically to describe another resource. In other words, metadata is 'data about data'.</p>\n<h4>4.8 Does the site work well in a range of browser window sizes?</h4>\n<p>It is a common assumption amongst developers that average screen sizes are increasing. Some developers assume that the average screen size is now 1024px wide. But what about users with smaller screens and users with hand held devices? Are they part of your target audience and are they being disadvantaged?</p>\n<h3>5. Basic Usability</h3>\n<h4>5.1 Is there a clear visual hierarchy?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Organise and prioritise the contents of a page by using size, prominence and content relationships</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.great-web-design-tips.com/web-site-design/165.html\">Create a Clear Visual Hierarchy</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.2 Are heading levels easy to distinguish?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use header elements to convey document structure and use them according to specification</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-logical-headings\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 -- checkpoint 3.5</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.3 Is the site's navigation easy to understand?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your navigation system should give your visitor a clue as to what page of the site they are currently on and where they can go next.</p>\n<p><em>[Design Tutorial -- Navigation](<a href=\"http://www.1stsitefree.com/design\">http://www.1stsitefree.com/design</a></em>nav.htm)_</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.4 Is the site's navigation consistent?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If each page on your site has a consistent style of presentation, visitors will find it easier to navigate between pages and find information</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.juicystudio.com/tutorial/accessibility/navigation.asp\">Juicy studios -- Navigation</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.5 Does the site use consistent and appropriate language?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The use of clear and simple language promotes effective communication. Trying to come across as articulate can be as difficult to read as poorly written grammar, especially if the language used isn't the visitor's primary language.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.juicystudio.com/tutorial/accessibility/clear.asp\">Clear language</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.6 Does the site have a sitemap page and contact page? Are they  easy to find?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most site maps fail to convey multiple levels of the site's information architecture. In usability tests, users often overlook site maps or can't find them. Complexity is also a problem: a map should be a map, not a navigational challenge of its own.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020106.html\">Site Map Usability</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.7 For large sites, is there a search tool?</h4>\n<p>While search tools are not needed on smaller sites, and some people will not ever use them, site-specific search tools allow users a choice of navigation options.</p>\n<h4>5.8 Is there a link to the home page on every page in the site?</h4>\n<p>Some users like to go back to a site's home page after navigating to content within a site. The home page becomes a base camp for these users, allowing them to regroup before exploring new content.</p>\n<h4>5.9 Are links underlined?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To maximise the <a href=\"http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordances-and-design.html\">perceived affordance</a> of clickability, colour and underline the link text. Users shouldn't have to guess or scrub the page to find out where they can click.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040510.html\">Guidelines for Visualizing Links</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.10 Are visited links clearly defined?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most important, knowing which pages they've already visited frees users from unintentionally revisiting the same pages over and over again.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040503.html\">Change the Color of Visited Links</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>6. Site management</h3>\n<h4>6.1 Does the site have a meaningful and helpful 404 error page that works from any depth in the site?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You've requested a page -- either by typing a URL directly into the address bar or clicking on an out-of-date link and you've found yourself in the middle of cyberspace nowhere. A user-friendly website will give you a helping hand while many others will simply do nothing, relying on the browser's built-in ability to explain what the problem is.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/perfect404/\">The perfect 404</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>6.2 Does the site use friendly URLs?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most search engines (with a few exceptions -- namely Google) will not index any pages that have a question mark or other character (like an ampersand or equals sign) in the URL... what good is a site if no one can find it?</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/article/search-engine-friendly-urls\">Search Engine-Friendly URLs</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the worst elements of the web from a user interface standpoint is the URL. However, if they're short, logical, and self-correcting, URLs can be acceptably usable</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.merges.net/theory/20010305.html\">How to make URLs user-friendly</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.websitegoodies.com/article/32\">Creating Search Engine Friendly URLs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.merges.net/theory/20010305.html\">How to make URLs user-friendly</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.3 Does the site's URL work without \"www\"?</h4>\n<p>While this is not critical, and in some cases is not even possible, it is always good to give people the choice of both options. If a user types your domain name without the www and gets no site, this could disadvantage both the user and you.</p>\n<h4>6.4 Does the site have a favicon?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Favicon is a multi-resolution image included on nearly all professionally developed sites. The Favicon allows the webmaster to further promote their site, and to create a more customized appearance within a visitor's browser</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.favicon.com/\">Favicon.com</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Favicons are definitely not critical. However, if they are not present, they can cause 404 errors in your logs (site statistics). Browsers like IE will request them from the server when a site is bookmarked. If a favicon isn't available, a 404 error may be generated. Therefore, having a favicon could cut down on favicon specific 404 errors. The same is true of a 'robots.txt' file.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/webdev-tools/","relativePath":"docs/articles/webdev-tools.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"webdev-tools.md","name":"webdev-tools","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Developer Tools","weight":0,"excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<ol>\n<li>What Are Web Development Tools?</li>\n</ol>\n<h5><strong>Client-side</strong>Otherwise known as front-end web development, this refers to anything a user can see or engage with—an app or website are good examples. This is about providing a top-notch user experience and smooth interface (usually with a combination of HTML, CSS and various JavaScript libraries.<strong>Server-side</strong>Otherwise known as back-end web development, this refers to the stuff behind the scenes of apps and websites that users can't see. It's the frameworks, servers and databases that keep things running.Image Source: Paperform\n\n</h5>\n<p>When people speak about web development tools (or devtools in the biz), they're usually referring to the apps and software that allows web developers to test and debug the code and interface of a website or web application.</p>\n<p>Technically, the term doesn't refer to tools that *actually help you <em>build a webpage or app</em>. *But that distinction isn't helpful. Web developers require a range of tools that go beyond debugging and testing—whether it be a remote collaboration tool like Slack, a design tool like Figma, or even just an online forum like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">StackOverflow</a>.</p>\n<p>For that reason, we've gone beyond the traditional definition of devtools with the aim of giving a  realistic view of the kind of apps and software devs use in their day to day workflows. We think you'll find some familiar favourites, as well as some useful tools to add to your tech stack.</p>\n<h2>What To Consider When Choosing Web Development Tools</h2>\n<p>Whether you're <a href=\"https://www.templatemonster.com/bootstrap-website-templates/\">bootstrapping a website</a> from scratch or developing a simple web application, there are few things to keep in mind. Foremost is something that applies to any tool: pick the <em>right option for your specific needs.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What works for one project might not work for the next. As a web developer, you constantly need to investigate new tools and ways of doing things. Of course, we all have our favourites, but as a general rule, your tech stack should never be stagnant.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's one other general principle to keep in mind. Tech should simplify your workflow—not complicate it. We know how easy it is to get bogged down in the nerdy details, but when in doubt, ask yourself: <em>does this tool actually make my job easier?</em></p>\n<p>Here are a few things to think about beyond these broader considerations:</p>\n<p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Simply, what does each tool help achieve? Does it have a single purpose and can it be replaced by a more feature-rich option?</p>\n<p><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Ensure that the tools that you have control over balance comprehensive features with actually being useable.</p>\n<p><strong>Scalability:</strong> At least some of the tools that you use should be scalable to both small and large projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Portability:</strong> This may not be a gamechanger in the age of remote work, but often web devs travel between clients, the office, home and the local cafe.</p>\n<p><strong>Customisation:</strong> Whether it's a theme on Google Chrome or an add-on for your development environment, we all like to make tools feel unique to us.</p>\n<p><strong>Security:</strong> The security of users, your employer and the sites or apps you are working on always has to be looked after.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> If you work for a fancy startup with cash to splash this may not be an issue, but most folks will have to shell out for their own web development tools. Make sure you are getting bang for your buck.</p>\n<h3>A Note On Web Dev Tech Stacks</h3>\n<p>Web development is an all-encompassing term that refers to a bunch of roles. You can split web development into two parts: client-side and server-side.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, web developers specialise in one of the two. However, there are a few show-offs that can do both—they're referred to as full-stack developers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The term stack is used because the tools that websites and apps use  'stack' on top of each other to build the final product.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Check out this example of Paperform's tech stack for example.</p>\n<h2>The 50 Best Web Development Tools In 2021</h2>\n<p>Alright, as we Antipodeans say, no more beating around the bush. Let's get into the list of the best web development tools we recommend using in 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>📚 Read our guide on **[</strong>how to get web design clients fast<strong>](<a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/how-to-get-web-design-clients/\">https://paperform.co/blog/how-to-get-web-design-clients/</a>)</strong>.**</p>\n<h2>Code and Text Editors</h2>\n<p>Web developers wouldn't be able to do their jobs fast and efficiently without text editors. A dev's text editor of choice is kind of a holy thing—once devs find a text editor they love, they tend to stick with it for the long haul.</p>\n<p>Which is why it's such an important decision. It's like a carpenter choosing his hammer, or a Jedi Knight choosing his lightsaber. The good news is you can't go wrong with any listed below:</p>\n<h3>1. Atom</h3>\n<p>The creators of <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> describe it as a \"hackable text editor for the 21st Century\". This is in reference to the insane levels of customisation it offers that allow you to make it uniquely yours.</p>\n<p>Choose from thousands of open-source packages that add new functionality, tweak the look and feel with CSS, or even add your own major features with HTML and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Using Atom really is a smooth experience. It works with Mac, Windows or Linux and has all the features you would expect. Plus, there is a nice suite of real-time collaboration tools to help you work with a team.</p>\n<h3>2. Sublime Text</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> is going to be at the top of any list of the best text editors. It doesn't have all the advanced features other solutions do, but what it lacks in power, it more than makes up for with its beautiful appearance and overall ease of use.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With handy keyboard shortcuts, a Command Palette that you won't be able to live without once you use it and a UX to die for, it's an absolute pleasure to use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The context-aware auto-completion feature is particularly useful. It suggests code based on your text, meaning you can cut down on repetitive typing. Add to that an updated Python API, syntax definitions and hyper-fast load times, Sublime Text is hard to go past.</p>\n<h3>3. Notepad++</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">Notepad++</a> is for those of you who don't care about themes and minimalist design and all that fancy stuff. From an aesthetic viewpoint, it's not going to win any awards, but it's still a powerful open-source text editor that has most of your needs covered.</p>\n<p>Created by a talented software engineer web dev named Don Ho, Notepad++ is a user friendly text editing solution for Windows users. It supports 27 programming languages, synchronised edits and views, and uses Win32 API to produce a tiny program size and faster execution speed.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> This is also a good option for energy conscious users. By optimising as much as possible, Ho aims to use less CPU power and reduce power consumption, leading to a greener environment.</p>\n<h3>4. Vim</h3>\n<p>If you're after a highly configurable text editor to build your perfect programming environment, then <a href=\"https://www.vim.org/\">Vim</a> is the way to go. While it does work out of the box, for the most part, it's a tool that you have to learn to conquer.</p>\n<p>The cool thing about Vim is that it can be used for any type of text editing—from writing an email to posting blogs in Markup, or of course, editing HTML code. It comes with 200+ syntax files, a comprehensive tag system and integrations with Perl, TCL and Python, and can even act as an OLE automation server in Windows.</p>\n<h3>5. Visual Code Studio</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a> (or VS Code) is an open-source code editing program built by Microsoft. It runs everywhere and allows you to do anything from debugging code to inputting Git commands or creating Sass code.</p>\n<p>There is a bevy of appearance options, including the ability to customise fonts, icons, layout and colour scheme. But the remote development features are what set it apart—you can use a container or a remote machine as a full-featured dev environment.</p>\n<p>VS Code is the text editor of choice for Dean McPherson, Paperform's co-founder and resident code-geek. He uses the remote plugins for version control and to keep our global dev team working in the same virtual environment.</p>\n<h2>Web Application Frameworks</h2>\n<p>Web application frameworks (or just web frameworks) are software libraries that are designed to help you build web services, resources and APIs.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right framework for your project is super important. Why? Because it's difficult, time-consuming and expensive to switch to a different solution. It's much easier to stick with one.</p>\n<p>Below we've curated a list of the <a href=\"https://www.appypie.com/top-web-development-frameworks\">best web frameworks</a> in 2021—both front-end and back-end to cover all the bases. This is a big decision and this is only meant as an overview of options, so be sure to do further research before deciding on one.</p>\n<h3>6. Django</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a> is a high-level <a href=\"https://www.educba.com/python-frameworks/\">Python framework</a> built by expert developers and used by giant web apps like Reddit, Instagram and Uber. It's secure and scalable, which means it's suitable for a small side hustle or enterprise-scale projects.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, Django makes it easier to build great web apps. Fast. The focus here is on enabling devs to create sites and apps with less code (to get nerdy, Django's server-side processing speed is super fast and the file structure is feather-light).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Django's goal is to support devs to go from concept to completion as quickly as possible. They achieve this by encouraging clean design and swift development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the greatest strengths of Django is its community. They contribute a tonne of useful packages and utilities—a search on PyPI brings up 4,000+ packages free and ready to use.</p>\n<h3>7. Ruby On Rails</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> is a favourite in the dev community. While it requires a certain quality of code, as a general rule it's easy to read, write, monkey patch, test, maintain and deploy, making it any web developer's dream.</p>\n<p>Rails, as it's called in the biz, is used in a bunch of server-side web apps, including big names like Square, Hulu, Twitch and Shopify. It's a popular framework because straight out of the box you get structures for web services, pages and a database, requiring far less groundwork than other options.</p>\n<p>So why choose Rails? Well, it's an excellent choice if you're after a robust tool that's simple to use. It has a clean design language, an intuitive workflow, and seamlessly integrates with third-party applications.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> If you are starting to build your product, Ruby on Rails is an ideal solution to get your MVP up and running. It allows solo web developers to swiftly get projects off the ground and make changes on the fly.</p>\n<h3>8. Angular</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> (or Angularjs) is a popular Javascript framework created and maintained by Google. It's a cross-platform solution with a cohesive ecosystem of third-party components, meaning you can add a bunch of your own unique functionality improvements.</p>\n<p>You'll find all the relevant features you'd expect for each stage of the development process, from code generation and splitting to complex animation timelines.</p>\n<p>The Command-line Interface (CLI) is probably the most notable feature though. it allows you to initialise, develop, scaffold and maintain Angular apps right from the command shell.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> A JavaScript library is a collection or “library” of prewritten code snippets that can be used to repeat common JavaScript functions. It's also important to note, that which JavaScript framework you use often depends on your client's/business' stack.</p>\n<h3>9. React</h3>\n<p>React (<a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React.js</a>) is another great Javascript library built by another ultra-powerful tech company: in this case, Facebook. Made specifically for building user interfaces, it makes it painless to create interactive UIs in a visual way.</p>\n<p>A component-based system means that individual components manage their own state, and can then be composed to build complex UIs. React can also render on a server using Node, and with <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\">React Native</a> you can power mobile apps as well.</p>\n<p>React is one of the most popular of the many JavaScript frameworks available. Used by WordPress for their backend and Block Editor, it's a platform to consider for any web developer working with user interfaces.</p>\n<h3>10. Vue</h3>\n<p>Yet another JavaScript library, like React, <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a> (or Vue.js) is built for working with user interfaces. Labelling itself as a more “approachable, versatile and performant” alternative, it helps you create a more maintainable and testable codebase.</p>\n<p>As with other leading frameworks, Vue allows you to take a webpage and split it up into reusable components. Each component then has its own HTML, CSS and JS needed to render that piece of the page—making it faster to make granular changes.</p>\n<p>Vue offers a more “batteries-included” approach to web application development. It's simple to use and comes with <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/\">comprehensive documentation</a> and templates to guide you along.</p>\n<h3>11. Meteor</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meteor.com/\">Meteor.js</a> is a free and open-source full-stack isomorphic framework (meaning you can run it both on the client and server side). It might not be as popular as React or Vue, but it's still considered one of the best solutions to enable devs to swiftly build and deploy web, mobile or desktop apps.</p>\n<p>One of Meteor's biggest selling points is that it seamlessly integrates with the rest of your tech stack—allowing you to focus on building rather than configuring tools to work together. Meteor APM also provides real-time metrics so you can monitor how your app is running.</p>\n<p>Boasting almost 14,000 packages, over half a million unique installs and used by companies like Ikea, Qualcomm and Honeywell, Meteor is a strong option.</p>\n<h3>12. ASP.NET</h3>\n<p>Alright, by now this is a familiar story. Prepare for the buzzwords and giant tech companies. <a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet\">ASP.NET</a> is a free, cross-platform framework for <a href=\"https://www.techcronus.com/asp-net-application-development/\">building web apps</a> and services developed by Microsoft.</p>\n<p>What sets it apart from other frameworks is that it uses C# instead of JavaScript. C# supports reference-type (class) and value-type (struct) user-defined types, which can unlock significant performance benefits over JavaScript if you're a more advanced web developer.</p>\n<p>If you're looking to learn NET then there are plenty of resources. Microsoft has plenty of <a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet\">learning materials</a> and there's an active <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website\">community on GitHub</a> with over 100,000 people and 3,700 companies contributing.</p>\n<h2>Front-End Frameworks</h2>\n<p>Front-end frameworks (or “CSS frameworks”) are packages containing pre-written, standardised code for easy application. It's kind of like a coding dictionary to help you quickly complete actions without having to come up with code yourself.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that there is some crossover with tools we've previously covered. For example, according to the <a href=\"https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/\">State of JavaScript 2020</a>*, in the US, React, Angular and Vue *are the three most popular front-end frameworks.</p>\n<p>Here are some other viable options:</p>\n<h3>13. Bootstrap</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> is a leading open-source CSS framework created by a bunch of the developers behind Twitter (ever heard of it?). Released back in 2011, it's a full-scale tool designed to help you quickly create and customise responsive mobile-first sites.</p>\n<p>It features Sass variables and mixins (so you can assign variables to a name and refer to it rather than the value itself), extensive prebuilt components and comprehensive JavaScript plugins. In a first for front-end frameworks, it also comes with its own SVG icon library designed to work with your Bootstrap sites.</p>\n<h3>14. Semantic UI</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://semantic-ui.com/\">Semantic UI</a> is a component framework for theming websites using what they call “human-friendly HTML” (sorry dogs). What they mean by this is that the tool uses words and classes as exchangeable concepts, giving you the same benefits as BEM without the headache.</p>\n<p>But the real strength here is the breadth of Semantic UI's components. Whether it's elements, collections, views, modules of behaviours, the whole gamut of interface design is covered.</p>\n<h3>15. Foundation</h3>\n<p>The folks at <a href=\"https://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a> refer to their tool as \"the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world\", which is certainly setting the bar high. Though it really is suitable for any device, medium and level of accessibility.</p>\n<p>Foundation is packed with features to help build content-focused websites, even providing users with HTML, CSS &#x26; Javascript templates to speed up the process. You can also use Foundation For Emails to craft HTML emails that look a million bucks on any platform.</p>\n<h3><strong>16. Materialize</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://materializecss.com/\">Materialize</a> is a modern framework based on Google's Material Design language, combining the classic <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/principles-of-design/\">principles of design</a> with innovation and tech. As a language its goal is to help unify user experience across any platform, which is fitting, as this is a focus at Materialize as well.</p>\n<p>From the animations to UI elements and everything between, there's a real focus on <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/ux-design-portfolio/\">user experience</a> above all else. That's not to say the technical tools aren't there. They are. It's fast, robust and has a low learning curve.</p>\n<h3>17. ChromeDevTools</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/\">Chrome DevTools</a> is the name for the web development tools built into the Google Chrome web browser. No need to download any programs or check if it's got MacOS compatibility—just right click in the browser, choose “Inspect” and get stuck in.</p>\n<p>It doesn't have as many features as the other options on this list, but it does let you edit pages and diagnose problems with your sites. View and manipulate the DOM, change a page's style sheets (CSS) or use it as a JavaScript debugger.</p>\n<h3>18. Svelte</h3>\n<p>We love <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> for two reasons. One, it just sounds awesome and two, it's all about empowering folks to build their projects with *way less code, *which is something we're passionate about here at Paperform.</p>\n<p>Technically, Svelte isn't a framework or a library. It's a “compiler”, and it's gained quite a reputation in the web dev community for being one of the best frontend frameworks on the market. It's lightweight, SEO-optimised and unlike tools like React or Vue, doesn't require heavy browser processing.</p>\n<p>Svelte's “killer app” is that is has no virtual Dom. This means there's considerably less re-renders of the UI, leading to a lightning fast experience. Some devs will be put off by this, but it makes it an ideal option for beginners or smaller projects.</p>\n<h3>19. Ember</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://emberjs.com/\">Ember.js</a> is an open-source JavaScript web framework released back in 2011. Since then it's been adopted by a large chunk of the web dev community and it's easy to see why—using it's simple and, whether you're creating feature-rich apps or client-side websites, the user experience is seamless.</p>\n<p>Working with Ember is a “batteries included” experience. Out of the box you have all the tools to start building UIs that work on any device. The built-in development environment comes with fast rebuilds, auto-reload and a test runner. Ember Data also lets you set up asynchronous relationships and keep models up to date across your app, which is perfect for remote work.</p>\n<p>Not sold? Some of the biggest and best development teams in the world use Ember to iterate on their products, including Netflix, Intercom and Apple. Convinced?</p>\n<h2>Package Managers</h2>\n<p>If you've ever installed a bunch of programs on your computer you'll know it's a tedious process. You've got to visit each individual website, download the installer, then set each one up individually.</p>\n<p>This is fine if all you're doing is downloading Spotify. But back- and front-end developers work with hundreds of programs. Which is why package managers exist. These tools automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing programs from a computer's operating system.</p>\n<h3>20. Yarn</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/\">Yarn</a> is a relatively new package manager built by Facebook. It's known for its speed and stability—about the only two things you need from a package manager. But what sets it apart from similar tools is that it doubles as a project management tool.</p>\n<p>Installation is a breeze, and if you get stuck, the documentation is comprehensive. The Workspace feature allows you to split your project into sub-components, which is handy for keeping multiple versions of your project live. There is also a (small) plugin library to extend functionality.</p>\n<h3>21. Node Package Manager (npm)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">Node Package Manager</a> is a package manager for NodeJS, created in 2009 as an open-source project to give JavaScript devs an easy way to share code modules. The npm Registry consists of more than a million packages—making it the largest software registry in the world.</p>\n<p>With a quick search you'll find everything from front-end web apps to robots and routers. There is hardly a working web developer out there that wouldn't have used npm at some point. And, now that it's moved to GitHub, npm's already vibrant community is only going to grow.</p>\n<h3>22. DPKG - Package Manager for Debian</h3>\n<p>Debian is a stable and secure Linux-based operating system extremely popular with web devs. <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html\">Dpkg</a> is a tool built specifically to manage Debian packages. While dpkg does have a more user-friendly front-end alternative called <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude\">aptitude</a>, dpkg itself runs entirely via the command line.</p>\n<p>In terms of functionality, it's definitely a more low-level solution. But if you're trying to handle the installation and removal of Debian software, it's the place to start. For a more advanced tool try <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman\">Pacman</a> or <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/Apt\">APT</a> (literally, Advanced Package Tool). Both fetch packages from remote locations and deal with more complex functions.</p>\n<h2>Git Clients</h2>\n<p>In Britain, 'Git' is slang for someone you think is a bit stupid. But in the world of web development, Git is the name for the software used to track changes in file sets. Most of the time it's used to help devs collaborate during software development.</p>\n<p>A Git *client *is the software you use to work with Git repositories, which can be either remote or locally stored. These allow you to make changes to your Git project (e.g. pushing changes and staging). There are a bunch of different Git clients available across various operating systems.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> Git is a command line interface and Git clients aren't strictly necessary. It's kind of like using a translator versus learning a language natively. GUIs don't have all the same functionality that a command line client offers, which is why many web devs go that route instead.</p>\n<h3><strong>23. Github Desktop</strong></h3>\n<p>Built by GitHub, the authority when it comes to all things Git, <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">Github Desktop</a> is a tool that allows you to interact with GitHub from your desktop. It's all about giving you a beautiful interface to cut down on distraction and let you focus on what matters.</p>\n<p>Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a Git newbie, GitHub Desktop has you covered. Quickly add commits with collaborators, see all open pull requests from your repositories, and easily see before and after shots of your work in progress with expanded image diff support.</p>\n<p>On top of that there's a heap of automated testing tools to play with. Open-source and available on MacOS and Windows, GitHub is pretty much the default option.</p>\n<h3>24. GitKraken</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gitkraken.com/\">GitKraken</a> bills itself as the “easiest, safest and most powerful” way to use Git. They understand that Git can be difficult to learn, which is why they offer exhaustive docs, as well as integrations with GitHub, GitLab and Azure DevOps to make adding remotes easy.</p>\n<p>The UI is equal parts gorgeous and intuitive. One particularly helpful feature is the ability to map complicated commands to a single button or click of the keyboard. If you're working with a team, the visual commit graph also assists you to quickly view who made code changes and when.</p>\n<p>Other notable features include syntax highlighting, a nifty built-in code editor, interactive rebase and light and dark mode for those late-night coding sessions.</p>\n<h3>25. SourceTree</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/\">Sourcetree</a> is a Graphical User Interface (GUI for the cool kids) used to manage Git repository hosts. Built by Atlassian (go Aussies!) it allows you to visualise and manage your repos so you can focus purely on coding.</p>\n<p>Whether you're just starting out as a web developer or  are an old pro, Sourcetree has all the tools you need. Leave the command line behind, or delve deeper to review change-sets, stash or cherry-pick between branches—built-in smart branching keeps development clean and efficient.</p>\n<p>Sourcetree is available to download for free on both MacOS and Windows. They've got a huge range of <a href=\"https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/tutorial-learn-bitbucket-with-sourcetree/\">tutorials</a> that'll have you up and running in no time. After some initial hiccups, it's now more powerful and reliable than almost any other Git client.</p>\n<h2>API and Testing Cloud Tools</h2>\n<p>Web APIs are a crucial part of web development these days. APIs allow devs to access specific features or data within an application, service or other system.</p>\n<p>For example, the tech world recently went nuts when Notion announced the beta for their API. By accessing the API devs can now connect other apps with Notion pages and databases.</p>\n<p><strong>📚 Learn more about **[</strong>Paperform's Notion integration<strong>](<a href=\"https://paperform.co/integrations/notion/\">https://paperform.co/integrations/notion/</a>)</strong>.**</p>\n<p>When testing and building with web APIs it's crucial to have reliable tools. Here are some of the best:</p>\n<h3>26. Postman</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.postman.com/\">Postman</a> is an API platform for building using APIs (duh) with features centred around simplifying the process and streamlining team collaboration. <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/api-platform/\">They promise</a> 5x faster development, 4x faster bug fixes and a whopping 10x more effective team collaboration.</p>\n<p>Do they back it up? The *15 million *developers that use Postman would say so. There are integrated tools for every stage of the API lifecycle, from design, mocking, testing and deploying all the way through to maintenance and deprecation.</p>\n<h3>27. REST Assured</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://rest-assured.io/\">REST Assured</a> is the tool of choice for most web devs working with Java. Made so you don't have to be a HTTP expert to use it, REST Assured enables you to test and validate REST services with the simplicity of more dynamic languages like Ruby.</p>\n<p>It saves you time and effort through automating part of the boilerplate code required to set up HTTP connections, send and receive requests and parse responses. There are also Given/When/Then test notations to help make tests easily comprehensible.</p>\n<h3>28. HoppScotch</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://hoppscotch.io/\">HoppScotch</a> is a lightweight open source API development tool that runs smoothly and looks beautiful. Over the last few months it's gained popularity with the dev community, largely thanks to its balance of advanced functionality and gorgeous design.</p>\n<p>Whether you need to establish full-duplex communication channels or execute queries with GraphQL, Hoppscotch can handle just about anything you throw at it. You can even add your own translations if English isn't your preferred language.</p>\n<p>Other features include collections to keep API requests organised, the ability to sync and restore request entries with a click, and real-time connections with WebSocket, MQTT and more.</p>\n<h3><strong>29. LambdaTest</strong></h3>\n<p>It's crucial that web applications and services work the same way no matter what browser folks use to access them. But you can't check how your HTML, CSS and JavaScript looks on every web browser and operating system on the planet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lambdatest.com/\">LambaTest</a> can. This tool performs automated and live interactive testing on 2,000+ real browsers and operating systems to help ensure your web apps look spiffy wherever they appear.</p>\n<p>It also has the ability to auto-generate full page screenshots across any browser, OS, device or resolution. And with integrated debugging, geolocation testing and seamless collaboration via Asana, Slack and Trello integrations, Lambdatest is a must-have.</p>\n<h2>Web Design and Prototyping Tools</h2>\n<p>It's not enough just to know how to code. Part of being a web designer is understanding what goes into good UI and <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/in-conversation-kyro-samaan/\">UX design</a>—from prototyping and wire-framing to creating a visual language for your app. These <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/ux-design-tools/\">design tools</a> are vital.</p>\n<h3>30. Figma</h3>\n<p>Only a few years ago, if you wanted a professional design tool you'd need to spend a whole lot of cash and download complex software. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/ui-design-tool/\">Figma</a>, you get everything you need to design for the web, completely free and accessible from any browser. From UI, UX and <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/graphic-design-tools/\">graphic design</a> to wire-framing and diagramming, Figma truly is the all-in-one platform for your design needs.</p>\n<p>It's like LEGO for web devs. Need to mock up a mobile app? Design an entire UI? Build your client's dream website from scratch? Just use the drag-and-drop editor and away you go. With version history you can even collaborate in real-time and not worry about breaking things.</p>\n<p>There's a reason the whole internet is raving about it—Figma's a rare tool that you will find yourself actively looking for reasons to use. It's not hyperbole when we say that it's seriously the only design tool you'll need.</p>\n<h3>31. Adobe XD</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html\">Adobe XD</a> is just the latest in a long range of excellent design tools from Adobe. With XD you can sketch wireframes and mockups, build interactive prototypes and create high-fidelity designs for any screen, thanks to their vector-based system.</p>\n<p>Flat images not enough? 3D transform allows you to turn static objects into dynamic, three dimensional designs in a click. Move or rotate objects, add the appearance of depth, or even build unique immersive AR/VR experiences.</p>\n<p>Above all, Adobe XD succeeds at making your prototypes feel like the real thing—with no coding required. Add user flows, interactions and motion, and save time by using reusable buttons and components.</p>\n<p>Of course, Adobe XD works seamlessly with the rest of the Adobe suite (editing .PSD files from Photoshop is a particularly handy feature). There are a range of co-editing tools to aid real-time collaboration and 200+ plugins to extend functionality.</p>\n<h3>32. Sketch</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sketch.com/\">Sketch</a> vs Figma is kind of like Apple vs Android: both offer very similar tools, and which one you prefer comes down to preference and your individual workflow.</p>\n<p>Sketch happens to be the app of choice for companies like Google, Facebook and Xbox. It's easy to use, offers a host of useful keyboard shortcuts, and is lightning fast no matter what you throw at it, from <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/social-media-design/\">social media designs</a> to working prototypes or fancy new icon sets.</p>\n<p>Having said that, most web developers agree that Figma's prototyping capabilities are superior to Sketch. They also cite the built-in version history, collaboration features and the way Figma handles colour and text styling. The Auto-Layout is also preferred over Sketch's Smart layout.</p>\n<p>But. That's not the whole story. Sketch is regarded as being more stable (Figma can be on the buggy side sometimes), having clearer layer organisation, and being faster to load large files. There's also a dark mode, which we all know, is music to any web developer's ear.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> The Figma vs Sketch battle isn't going to be decided in this blog post. Luckily, Figma is free to use and Sketch has a generous free trial. If you're unsure which is the right choice for you, just try them both.</p>\n<h3>33. ProtoPie</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.protopie.io/\">ProtoPie</a> bill themselves as the \"easiest way to turn your interaction design ideas into realistic prototypes\". It's a no-code creation tool used to create interactive prototypes for mobile, web, desktop or the 'Internet of Things' (IoT).</p>\n<p>What sets ProtoPie apart is one thing: simplicity. Their goal isn't to be the most complex tool on the market—they want to take the pain out of building workable prototypes, fast. As with any no-code tool, the emphasis is on replacing code with simple buttons and keyboard commands to simplify your workflow.</p>\n<p>There's a gradual learning curve which makes it great for beginners. Prototypes also interact with each other, meaning you can make interactions across devices. It's not as popular as the big players, but it's certainly a powerful tool.</p>\n<h3>34. Framer</h3>\n<p>If you're comfortable with code, then <a href=\"https://framer.com/\">Framer</a> is an awesome tool to empower you to create interactive, highly-customisable prototypes. Web devs around the world use it to build apps, websites, design systems and even slick new video game interfaces.</p>\n<p>What sets it apart from something like Figma? Well, with Framer the idea is that you can work with designs that can *realistically be implemented *with code. It's a bridge for UX designers and developers to collaborate and rapidly experiment in a shared workspace.</p>\n<p>📚 **Related reading: **<a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/in-conversation-kyro-samaan/\"><strong>How to stand out as a UX Designer</strong></a></p>\n<p>Even if code isn't your thing, Framer is great. The GUI and design elements are on part with Sketch (or at least in the same ballpark) and the built-in prototyping is a breeze to use. There are also plenty of third-party packages to add new elements.</p>\n<h3>35. Toolset</h3>\n<p>Sick of doing everything with code? <a href=\"https://toolset.com/\">Toolset</a> is a WordPress page builder which lets you build custom sites without any code. This is a great option for web developers and designers looking to complete complex projects quickly.</p>\n<p>Use Toolset to design from within WordPress. Create rich sites that look great on any device and load quickly for the SEO gods. It's got everything you could require to set up custom post types, fields, templates, searches, front-end forms and more.</p>\n<p>The biggest benefit of Toolset is that it saves you from having to use a bunch of different tools to build WordPress sites—all for a reasonable price of $69.</p>\n<h3>36. Animator By Haiku</h3>\n<p>Animation is difficult but <a href=\"https://www.haikuforteams.com/animator/\">Animator by Haiku</a> makes it a little bit more palatable. It lets you bring motion design to production, from your initial design tools like Figma to your final codebase.</p>\n<p>Animator uses an interface called Timeline to choreograph animations in a visual way. You can sequence and animate elements using the built-in curves library, or delve deeper with the custom editor. If you're more comfortable with code, use any code editor of your choice to animate directly from your code.</p>\n<h3>37. Affinity Designer</h3>\n<p>Adobe Illustrator has long been the industry standard when it comes to creating vector graphics. However, the new kid on the block, <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/\">Affinity Designer</a>, is certainly giving Adobe a run for its money.</p>\n<p>You'll find Affinity evangelists all over the net—and for good reason. It offers a silky-smooth experience at a much more affordable price, custom-built with professional illustrators, web designers, game devs and other creatives in mind.</p>\n<p>Affinity offers many of the same tools as Adobe Illustrator in a beautifully designed (and not bloated) package. Work with vectors and rasters to create concept art, print projects, logos, icons, UIs or just about anything else you can imagine.</p>\n<p>The biggest drawcard? There's no monthly fee. You can own Affinity Designer for a one-off payment of $84.99 on Windows or Mac or $34.99 on iPad.</p>\n<h2>Collaboration Tools</h2>\n<p>We've covered just about all the technical tools you could possibly need to be a web developer. But whether you're working in-house, at an agency or going it alone as a freelancer, <a href=\"https://unito.io/features/\">collaboration tools</a> are equally as important as your text editor of choice.</p>\n<p>Often the success of a project isn't simply down to technical brilliance—it relies on clear and efficient communication. The tools below will help you achieve it.</p>\n<h3>38. ClickUp</h3>\n<p>Product management tools should do two things: simplify your processes and help you ship products faster. <a href=\"https://clickup.com/\">ClickUp</a> does both. With an expansive suite of tools, it is truly “one app to replace them all”, covering tasks, docs, chat, goals and more.</p>\n<p>Whether you're working solo or in a team, ClickUp lets you map out tasks, better plan your work and see your overall product vision. The major benefit here is the dizzying versatility of the platform. From building mind maps to planning tasks on a Kanban board, you can build out your own custom product management setup.</p>\n<h3>39. Asana</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://asana.com/\">Asana</a> is probably the single most well-known and popular project management and collaboration tool on the market. It's a tool built to stop you shuffling between emails, spreadsheets and other apps to keep organised—from brainstorming to meeting that deadline, you can manage everything with Asana.</p>\n<p>At Paperform we use Asana to assign tasks to team members, create projects split among our Product, Marketing and Content teams, and monitor deadlines to ensure we're hitting our goals. It's simple and visual, and is particularly excellent for keeping remote teams on the same page.</p>\n<h3>40. JIRA</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\">JIRA</a> is the go-to project management platform for software teams to plan, track and release their products. From creating user stories and planning sprints to the final stages of shipping and data analysis, JIRA is *the *way to take any product to launch and beyond.</p>\n<p>One big advantage JIRA has over other similar tools is that it's so customisable. It is possible to build the perfect workflow for your specific product or team—this is also a slight drawback, as it results in a slightly steeper learning curve upfront.</p>\n<p>As you'd expect, it's built with trademark Atlassian polish. And with the Atlassian Marketplace you can connect with over 3,000 first and third-party apps like Slack, Google Drive and GitHub, to extend functionality.</p>\n<h3>41. Slack</h3>\n<p>If you work online in any capacity and haven't heard of <a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-au/\">Slack</a>, you must be living under a rock, at the bottom of the ocean, next to a starfish named Patrick. In the last few years, Slack has become synonymous with remote team communication.</p>\n<p>At its core Slack is a team messaging platform. It cuts down on the need for email by separating conversations into distinct Channels, so you can track topics, ideas and projects without long email threads. This makes it the virtual headquarters for your business.</p>\n<p>Of course, there's much more to it than simple text chat. Jump on video calls, add integrations with your favourite tools, and even communicate with external clients or folks in other companies</p>\n<p>Slack isn't just for teams, either. Communities allow you to connect with people in your niche—<a href=\"https://http//www.javaspecialists.eu/slack/\">Java Specialists</a>, <a href=\"https://rubydevs.herokuapp.com/\">Ruby Developers</a> and <a href=\"https://pyslackers.com/web\">Python Developers</a> are just a few of the most active.</p>\n<h3>42. Zoom</h3>\n<p>Occasionally an app or program hits levels of popularity so high that it becomes the noun for what it's used for. This happened to Google long ago (“I'll Google it”) and it happened to video chat tool <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a> in the last year and a half (RIP Skype).</p>\n<p>This happened for a reason: Zoom is awesome. While nothing replaces the feeling of face-to-face communication, it's the next best thing. Whether you want to chat to your family across the country or liaise with web design clients, it makes video calls ridiculously easy.</p>\n<p>Zoom is free for 40-minute calls, meaning your meetings come with a convenient end timer. Plus you can record any calls (with your companion's permission), which has become a popular way to record <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/how-to-record-a-webinar/\">webinars</a> and podcasts.</p>\n<p>**📚 Related reading: **<a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/how-to-be-a-good-interviewer/\"><strong>How to be a good interviewer</strong></a></p>\n<h2>Miscellaneous Web Development Tools</h2>\n<h3>43. TypeScript</h3>\n<p>TypeScript is an insanely popular open-source language that builds extra features on top of JavaScript. Essentially, think of regular Java as Clark Kent and TypeScript as Superman—bigger, better, faster and all-round more capable.</p>\n<p>Devs love Typescript because it makes their job easier. It catches both code and type errors, as well as bugs that can easily be missed. This reduces troubleshooting time, while also saving you the effort of having to track down mistakes manually.</p>\n<p>The only real downside is that once you try TypeScript you'll find it hard to return to vanilla Java. The good thing is that you don't need to make a binary choice—all valid JavaScript code is also TypeScript code, and TypeScript can be transformed into Java too.</p>\n<p>If you want clean, simple code with excellent documentation and tools that save you hours of time, TypeScript might be worth a try. Just don't think you can master it in a few minutes, as most devs find there's a steep (albeit worthwhile) learning curve.</p>\n<h3>44. Sass</h3>\n<p>You might've seen the term <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/guide\">Sass</a> mentioned in web dev circles. But what is it? Well, Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends what you can do with regular CSS, adding special features like variables, nested rules, inheritance (not the monetary type) and mixins.</p>\n<p>The benefit is that it speeds up your workflow and modularises your code, making edits easier and more efficient to make. It allows you to achieve the same end result as regular CSS, with a fraction of the effort.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say you're working with a theme colour that you keep having to reuse in your CSS code. Rather than having to retype it every time, you can specify the colour once and save the variable. Then, every time you want to use that colour you just refer to the variable instead of hard-coding it.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> Sass is compatible with any version of CSS, the only requirement being you need Ruby installed for it to work. Just make sure you don't start using Sass before you have CSS mastered—it's important to get a firm grip of the basics first.</p>\n<h3>45. Stack Overflow</h3>\n<p>Okay, so this isn't technically a tool. However, it's not hyperbole on the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> website when it says, “every developer has a tab open to Stack Overflow”. Ask around—they do. It's the most popular and comprehensive web development community on the internet.</p>\n<p>Stack Overflow is a public platform that aims to build the single most definitive collection of coding questions and answers. Developers, system admins and data scientists of every shape and size rely on it for accurate information to difficult technical challenges.</p>\n<p>We're talking the real nitty gritty. If you want to know why InvokeAsync shows an an error in a Blazor component, how to undo the most recent local commits in Git, or why HTML thinks the tag “chucknorris” is a colour, this is the place for you.</p>\n<p>While it's undoubtedly a gold mine of useful resources, it's important to note that the community can be a bit toxic when it comes to welcoming new web developers. Stack Overflow mods are aware of this (and have added new guidelines in response) but do be wary—and look for existing answers before asking a query of your own.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> More broadly it would be remiss not to mention your other best friend: Google! Not even the most seasoned web developer knows how to fix everything and you can almost guarantee that you'll find someone out there who's had the same problem as you at some point.</p>\n<h3>46. Squoosh Image Optimiser\n</h3>\n<p>Assets. Content. Media. Even the simplest web design project will need basic images and icons. Image optimisation apps allow you to compress image file sizes without affecting quality, which means your sites will stay as fast and responsive as possible.</p>\n<p>Now, there's no shortage of great image optimisation apps but we love <a href=\"https://squoosh.app/\">Squoosh</a>. It's a no-frills experience that does exactly what you need it to. Just drag and drop your image into the editor and Squoosh does its thing.</p>\n<p>You aren't limited to compression either. With the simple interface you can resize, compress or change the image format. The changes are almost instant and the finished product can be downloaded with a click.</p>\n<p>One drawback is that you can only work with one image at a time. So, if you're working on a large project requiring lots of images, <a href=\"https://shortpixel.com/\">ShortPixel</a> may better suit your needs.</p>\n<h3>47. ColorPick Eyedropper Chrome Extension</h3>\n<p>Whether you're designing a website, putting together a UI or creating a <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/canva-alternatives/\">Canva design</a>, colour is serious business for web developers and designers. Colours are crucial for brand awareness, evoking certain emotions and, most importantly, accessibility.</p>\n<p>Colour picking tools allow you to identify the Hex codes of elements on the web to gain inspiration or keep designs consistent. There are thousands of tools in this space, but you won't find one easier than <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en\">ColorPick Eyedropper for Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>Just click the extension and hover over <em>any</em> element on *any *webpage. A small box appears with the Hex code and RGB model. These are automatically copied to the clipboard for you to use. If your only experience working with colours was using crayons in kindergarten, Material.io has a great to the <a href=\"https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes\">Material Design system</a>.</p>\n<h3>48. Google Lighthouse</h3>\n<p>Technically a part of Chrome Developer Tools, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/\">Google Lighthouse</a> deserves its own dedicated entry. It's an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it on any existing web page to audit overall performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO.</p>\n<p>While you can run it from the command line, or as a Node module, the visual interface within Chrome DevTools is useful for getting actionable insight into what's working (and what is not working) about any given site.</p>\n<p>There are two new features that extend the functionality somewhat too. Stack Packs allow Lighthouse to detect what platform your site is built on and display more specific guidance based on your unique tools.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> New Lighthouse plugins also allow you to use the data you've collected to create new audits and reports. Used in tandem with PageSpeed Insights, it's a surefire way to make sure your website is in good shape.</p>\n<h3>49. A Second Monitor</h3>\n<p>No guide to web development tools would be complete without recommending you treat yourself to a second monitor. The extra screen real estate makes life <em>so much easier</em> and development <em>so much faster.</em></p>\n<p>Just think of a world where you can have IDE and terminal open on one screen, and the app that you're debugging on the other. Or Slack on the first, your browser and Stack Overflow on the second, maybe Spotify in the corner for some Lo-Fi beats.</p>\n<p>With one screen you're constantly cycling through open applications. Half the time you lose a tab, or forget what you're looking for altogether. This takes time, and as we all know, time is money. Treat yourself to a second monitor—it's a whole new world.</p>\n<h3>50. Paperform</h3>\n<p>For all the advances we've made in the world—sending billionaires to the moon, having the power of a supercomputer in our pockets—it's still weirdly difficult to code beautiful online forms (seriously, PHP is a pain.) That's where <a href=\"https://paperform.co/\">Paperform</a> comes in.</p>\n<p>Paperform empowers you to create beautiful <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/best-online-form-builders/\">online forms</a> and landing pages without any code. Just use our free-text editor to build anything from basic <a href=\"https://paperform.co/templates/contact-us-form/\">contact forms</a> to complex <a href=\"https://paperform.co/templates/apparel-order-form/\">eCommerce pages</a> that can be embedded anywhere on the internet.</p>\n<p>Use our theme tools to get started, then add your own unique tweaks with support for custom HTML and CSS. Developing on WordPress? We've even got a plugin that makes <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/wordpress-form-builder-plugins/\">embedding forms on WordPress</a> a breeze—and makes life way easier for you and your clients.</p>\n<p>But that's not all you can do. Want to collect feedback from <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/customer-satisfaction-survey/\">satisfied customers</a>? Send a <a href=\"https://paperform.co/templates/new-client-onboarding-form/\">client questionnaire</a> for each new project? Or maybe you want to set up a <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/one-page-website/\">landing page</a> where you can sell <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/online-course-ideas/\">online courses</a>, schedule appointments and <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/email-list-sign-ups/\">grow a mailing list</a>?</p>\n<p>With Paperform you can do all that and more. And with our 3,000+ Direct and Zapier integrations, connecting with the rest of your tech stack to streamline your web development workflow is so easy your grandma could do it</p>\n<p><img

My contribution was the following analogy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine an enormous speaker, mounted on a pole, playing a repeating sound. The speaker is so large, you can see the cone move back and forth with the sound. Mark a point on the cone, and now rotate the pole. Trace the point from an above-ground view, if the resulting squiggly curve is off-center, then there is frequency corresponding the pole's rotational frequency represented in the sound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr Bill Connelly from Australia National University has created an interactive simulation of the analogy.

Some\nrelated procedures go as far back as Babylonian times, but it was the\nhot topics of calculating asteroid orbits and solving the heat (flow)\nequation that led to several breakthroughs in the early 1800s. Whom\nexactly among Clairaut, Lagrange, Euler, Gauss and D'Alembert we\nshould thank is not exactly clear, but Gauss was the first to describe\nthe fast Fourier transform (an algorithm for computing the discrete\nFourier transform, popularized by Cooley and Tukey in 1965). Joseph\nFourier, after whom the transform is named, first claimed that\n<em>arbitrary</em> periodic <sup id=\"fnref-periodic\"><a href=\"#fn-periodic\" class=\"footnote-ref\">periodic</a></sup> functions can be expressed as a sum of\ntrigonometric functions.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>The discrete Fourier transform functionality in SciPy lives in the\n`scipy.fftpack<code></code> module.

Also used by <code>fft</code> internally when applicable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is complemented by the following functions in NumPy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>np.hanning</code>, <code>np.hamming</code>, <code>np.bartlett</code>, <code>np.blackman</code>,\n<code>np.kaiser</code>: Tapered windowing functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is also used to perform fast convolutions of large inputs by\n<code>scipy.signal.fftconvolve</code>.</p>\n<p>SciPy wraps the Fortran FFTPACK library—it is not the fastest out\nthere, but unlike packages such as FFTW, it has a permissive free\nsoftware license.</p>\n<h2>Choosing the length of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)</h2>\n<p>A naive calculation of the DFT takes $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ operations <sup id=\"fnref-big_o\"><a href=\"#fn-big_o\" class=\"footnote-ref\">big_o</a></sup>.\nHow come? Well, you have $N$\n(complex) sinusoids of different frequencies ($2 \\pi f \\times 0, 2 \\pi f \\times\n1, 2 \\pi f \\times 3, ..., 2 \\pi f \\times (N - 1)$), and you want to see how\nstrongly your signal corresponds to each. Starting with the first,\nyou take the dot product with the signal (which, in itself, entails $N$\nmultiplication operations). Repeating this operation $N$ times, once\nfor each sinusoid, then gives $N^2$ operations.</p>\n<p>Now, contrast that with the fast Fourier transform, which is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N \\log N\\right)$ in\nthe ideal case due to the clever re-use of\ncalculations—a great improvement! However, the classical Cooley-Tukey\nalgorithm implemented in FFTPACK (and used by SciPy) recursively breaks up the transform\ninto smaller (prime-sized) pieces and only shows this improvement for\n\"smooth\" input lengths (an input length is considered smooth when its\nlargest prime factor is small). For large prime-sized pieces, the\nBluestein or Rader algorithms can be used in conjunction with the\nCooley-Tukey algorithm, but this optimization is not implemented in\nFFTPACK.<sup id=\"fnref-fast\"><a href=\"#fn-fast\" class=\"footnote-ref\">fast</a></sup></p>\n<p>Let us illustrate:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import time\n\nfrom scipy import fftpack\nfrom sympy import factorint\n\nK = 1000\nlengths = range(250, 260)\n\n# Calculate the smoothness for all input lengths\nsmoothness = [max(factorint(i).keys()) for i in lengths]\n\n\nexec_times = []\nfor i in lengths:\n    z = np.random.random(i)\n\n    # For each input length i, execute the FFT K times\n    # and store the execution time\n\n    times = []\n    for k in range(K):\n        tic = time.monotonic()\n        fftpack.fft(z)\n        toc = time.monotonic()\n        times.append(toc - tic)\n\n    # For each input length, remember the *minimum* execution time\n    exec_times.append(min(times))\n\n\nf, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)\nax0.stem(lengths, np.array(exec_times) * 10**6)\nax0.set_ylabel('Execution time (µs)')\n\nax1.stem(lengths, smoothness)\nax1.set_ylabel('Smoothness of input length\\n(lower is better)')\nax1.set_xlabel('Length of input');\n</code></pre>\n<!-- caption text=\"FFT execution time vs smoothness for different input lengths\" -->\n<p>The intuition is that, for smooth input lengths, the FFT can be broken up\ninto many small pieces. After performing the FFT on the first piece,\nthose results can be reused in subsequent computations. This explains\nwhy we chose a length of 1024 for our audio slices earlier—it has a\nsmoothness of only 2, resulting in the optimal \"radix-2 Cooley-Tukey\"\nalgorithm, which computes the FFT using only $(N/2) \\log_2 N = 5120$ complex\nmultiplications, instead of $N^2 = 1048576$. Choosing $N = 2^m$\nalways ensures a maximally smooth $N$ (and, thus, the fastest FFT).</p>\n<h2>More discrete Fourier transform concepts</h2>\n<p>Next, we present a couple of common concepts worth knowing before\noperating heavy Fourier transform machinery, whereafter we tackle\nanother real-world problem: analyzing target detection in radar data.</p>\n<h3>Frequencies and their ordering</h3>\n<p>For historical reasons, most implementations return an array where\nfrequencies vary from low-to-high-to-low (see the box \"Discrete\nFourier transforms\" for further explanation of frequencies). E.g., when we do the real\nFourier transform of a signal of all ones, an input that has no\nvariation and therefore only has the slowest, constant Fourier\ncomponent (also known as the \"DC\" or Direct Current component—just\nelectronics jargon for \"mean of the signal\"), we see this DC component\nappearing as the first entry:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from scipy import fftpack\nN = 10\n\nfftpack.fft(np.ones(N))  # The first component is np.mean(x) * N\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we try the FFT on a rapidly changing signal, we see a high\nfrequency component appear:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">z = np.ones(10)\nz[::2] = -1\n\nprint(f'Applying FFT to {z}')\nfftpack.fft(z)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the FFT returns a complex spectrum which, in the case of\nreal inputs, is conjugate symmetrical (i.e., symmetric in the real\npart, and anti-symmetric in the imaginary part):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">x = np.array([1, 5, 12, 7, 3, 0, 4, 3, 2, 8])\nX = fftpack.fft(x)\n\nwith np.printoptions(precision=2):\n    print(\"Real part:     \", X.real)\n    print(\"Imaginary part:\", X.imag)\n</code></pre>\n<p>(And, again, recall that the first component is <code>np.mean(x) * N</code>.)</p>\n<p>The <code>fftfreq</code> function tells us which frequencies we are looking at\nspecifically:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">fftpack.fftfreq(10)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The result tells us that our maximum component occured at a frequency\nof 0.5 cycles per sample. This agrees with the input, where a\nminus-one-plus-one cycle repeated every second sample.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it is convenient to view the spectrum organized slightly\ndifferently, from high-negative to low to-high-positive (for now, we\nwon't dive too deeply into the concept of negative frequency, other\nthan saying a real-world sine wave is produced by a combination of\npositive and negative frequencies). We re-shuffle the spectrum using\nthe <code>fftshift</code> function.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Discrete Fourier transforms {.callout}</strong></p>\n<p>The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) converts a sequence of $N$\nequally spaced real or complex samples $x<em>{0},x</em>{1},\\ldots, x<em>{N-1}$ of\na function $x(t)$ of time (or another variable, depending on the\napplication) into a sequence of $N$ complex numbers $X</em>{k}$ by the\nsummation</p>\n<p>$$\nX<em>{k}=\\sum</em>{n=0}^{N-1}x_{n}e^{-j2\\pi kn/N},;k=0,1,\\ldots,\nN-1.\n$$</p>\n<p>With the numbers $X<em>{k}$ known, the inverse DFT _exactly</em> recovers the\nsample values $x_{n}$ through the summation</p>\n<p>$$x<em>{n}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum</em>{k=0}^{N-1}X_{k}e^{j2\\pi kn/N}.$$</p>\n<p>Keeping in mind that $e^{j\\theta}=\\cos\\theta+j\\sin\\theta,$ the last\nequation shows that the DFT has decomposed the sequence $x<em>{n}$ into a\ncomplex discrete Fourier series with coefficients $X</em>{k}$. Comparing\nthe DFT with a continuous complex Fourier series</p>\n<p>$$x(t)=\\sum<em>{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}c</em>{n}e^{jn\\omega_{0}t},$$</p>\n<p>the DFT is a <em>finite</em> series with $N$ terms defined at the equally\nspaced discrete instances of the <em>angle</em> $(\\omega<em>{0}t</em>{n})=2\\pi\\frac{k}{N}$\nin the interval $[0,2\\pi)$,\ni.e. <em>including</em> $0$ and <em>excluding</em> $2\\pi$.\nThis automatically normalizes the DFT so that time does\nnot appear explicitly in the forward or inverse transform.</p>\n<p>If the original function $x(t)$ is limited in frequency to less than\nhalf of the sampling frequency (the so-called <em>Nyquist frequency</em>),\ninterpolation between sample values produced by the inverse DFT will\nusually give a faithful reconstruction of $x(t)$. If $x(t)$ is <em>not</em>\nlimited as such, the inverse DFT can, in general, not be used to\nreconstruct $x(t)$ by interpolation. Note that this limit does not\nimply that there are <em>no</em> methods that can do such a\nreconstruction—see, e.g., compressed sensing, or finite rate of\ninnovation sampling.</p>\n<p>The function $e^{j2\\pi k/N}=\\left(e^{j2\\pi/N}\\right)^{k}=w^{k}$ takes on\ndiscrete values between $0$ and $2\\pi\\frac{N-1}{N}$ on the unit circle in\nthe complex plane. The function $e^{j2\\pi kn/N}=w^{kn}$ encircles the\norigin $n\\frac{N-1}{N}$ times, thus generating harmonics of the fundamental\nsinusoid for which $n=1$.</p>\n<p>The way in which we defined the DFT leads to a few subtleties\nwhen $n>\\frac{N}{2}$, for even $N$ <sup id=\"fnref-odd_n\"><a href=\"#fn-odd_n\" class=\"footnote-ref\">odd_n</a></sup>. The function $e^{j2\\pi kn/N}$ is plotted\nfor increasing values of $k$ in the figure below,\nfor the cases $n=1$ to $n=N-1$ for $N=16$. When $k$ increases from $k$\nto $k+1$, the angle increases by $\\frac{2\\pi n}{N}$. When $n=1$,\nthe step is $\\frac{2\\pi}{N}$. When $n=N-1$, the angle\nincreases by $2\\pi\\frac{N-1}{N}=2\\pi-\\frac{2\\pi}{N}$. Since $2\\pi$\nis precisely once around the circle, the step equates to $-\\frac{2\\pi}{N}$,\ni.e. in the direction of a negative\nfrequency. The components up to $N/2$ represent <em>positive</em> frequency\ncomponents, those above $N/2$ up to $N-1$ represent <em>negative</em>\nfrequencies. The angle increment for the component $N/2$\nfor $N$ even advances precisely halfway around the circle for\neach increment in $k$ and can therefore be interpreted as either a\npositive or a negative frequency. This component of the DFT represents\nthe Nyquist Frequency, i.e. half of the sampling frequency, and is\nuseful to orientate oneself when looking at DFT graphics.</p>\n<p>The FFT in turn is simply a special and highly efficient algorithm for\ncalculating the DFT. Whereas a straightforward calculation of the DFT\ntakes of the order of $N^{2}$ calculations to compute, the FFT\nalgorithm requires of the order $N\\log N$ calculations. The FFT was\nthe key to the wide-spread use of the DFT in real-time applications\nand was included in a list of the top $10$ algorithms of the $20^{th}$\ncentury by the IEEE journal Computing in Science &#x26; Engineering in the\nyear $2000$.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../figures/unit_circle_samples.png\" alt=\"Unit circle samples\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's examine the frequency components in a noisy image.

This signal is\ntransmitted by an antenna, after which it travels outwards, away from the\nradar. When it hits an object, part of the signal is reflected back\nto the radar, where it is received, multiplied by a copy of the\ntransmitted signal, and sampled, turning it into\nnumbers that are packed into an array.

We discard the\nother by applying a low-pass filter to the signal (i.e., a filter that\ndiscards any high frequencies).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A simple FMCW radar system</strong> {.callout}</p>\n<p><img src=\"../figures/FMCW_Block.png\" alt=\"The block diagram of a simple FMCW radar system\"></p>\n<p>A block diagram of a simple FMCW radar that uses separate\ntransmit and receive antennas is shown above. The radar consists of a waveform generator\nthat generates a sinusoidal signal of which the frequency varies\nlinearly around the required transmit frequency. The generated signal\nis amplified to the required power level by the transmit amplifier\nand routed to the transmit antenna via a coupler circuit where a copy\nof the transmit signal is tapped off. The transmit antenna radiates\nthe transmit signal as an electromagnetic wave in a narrow beam\ntowards the target to be detected. When the wave encounters an object\nthat reflects electromagnetic waves, a fraction of of the energy\nirradiating the target is reflected back to the receiver as a second\nelectromagnetic wave that propagates in the direction of the radar\nsystem. When this wave encounters the receive antenna, the antenna\ncollects the energy in the wave energy impinging on it and converts\nit to a fluctuating voltage that is fed to the mixer. The mixer\nmultiplies the received signal with a replica of the transmit signal\nand produces a sinusoidal signal with a frequency equal to the\ndifference in frequency between the transmitted and received\nsignals. The low-pass filter ensures that the received signal is band\nlimited (i.e., does not contain frequencies that we don't care about)\nand the receive amplifier strengthens the signal to a suitable\namplitude for the analog to digital converter (ADC) that feeds data\nto the computer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize, we should note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The data that reaches the computer consists of $N$ samples sampled\n(from the multiplied, filtered signal) at a sample frequency of\n$f_{s}$.</li>\n<li>The <strong>amplitude</strong> of the returned signal varies depending on the\n<strong>strength of the reflection</strong> (i.e., is a property of the target\nobject and the distance between the target and the radar).</li>\n<li>The <strong>frequency measured</strong> is an indication of the <strong>distance</strong> of the\ntarget object from the radar.</li>\n</ul>\n<!--\n\n### Signal properties in the time domain\n\nThe transmit signal is a sinusoidal signal with an instantaneous\nfrequency that increases linearly with time, as shown in\nFig. [fig:FMCW waveform](a).\n\nStarting at $f_{min}$, the frequency increases at a rate $S$ Hz/s to $f_{max}.$\nThe frequency is then decreased rapidly back to $f_{min}$\nafter which a next frequency sweep occurs.\n\nThis signal is radiated by a directional transmit antenna. When the\nwave with propagation velocity $v\\approx300\\times10^{6}$ m/s (the\npropagation speed of electromagnetic waves in air is ever-so-slightly\nslower than the speed of light in a vacuum) hits a target at a range $R$,\nthe echo will reach the radar after a time\n\n$$t_{d}=\\frac{2R}{v}.$$\n\nHere it is collected by the receive antenna and converted to a\nsinusoidally fluctuating voltage. The received signal is a replica of\nthe transmitted signal, delayed by the transit time $t_{d}$ and is\nshown dashed in Fig. [fig:FMCW waveform](b).\n\nA radar is designed to detect targets up to a maximum range $R_{max}$.\nEchoes from maximum range reach the radar after a transit\ntime $t_{dm}$ as shown in Fig. [fig:FMCW waveform](c).\n\nWe note that there is a constant difference in frequency between the\ntransmitted and received signals and this will be true for all targets\nafter time $t_{s}$ until $t_{e}$. We conclude from\nFig. [fig:FMCW waveform] that the frequency difference is given by\n\n$$f_{d}=S\\times t_{d}=\\frac{2SR}{v},$$\n\nwhere $T_{eff}=t_{e}-t_{s}=\\frac{N}{f_{s}}$ is the effective sweep duration\nof the radar. The frequency excursion of the sweep during $T_{eff}$ is\nthe effective bandwidth of the radar, given by\n\n$$B_{eff}=f_{max}-f_{1}=ST_{eff}.$$\n\nWe will see that the range resolution of the radar is determined by\nthe effective bandwidth.\n\n\nReturning to Fig. [fig: block-diagram], the signal produced by the\nreceiver at the input to the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) when\nthere is a single target is a sinusoid with constant amplitude,\nproportional to the amplitude of the echo, and constant frequency,\nproportional to the range to the target.\n\n-->\n<p><img src=\"../figures/FMCW_waveform.png\" alt=\"The frequency relationships in an FMCW radar with\n linear frequency modulation\"></p>\n<p>To start off, we'll generate some synthetic signals, after which we'll\nturn our focus to the output of an actual radar.</p>\n<p>Recall that the radar is increasing its frequency as it transmits at a\nrate of $S$ Hz/s.

The noise floor of a\nradar limits its ability to detect weak echoes. -->\n<h3>Windowing, applied</h3>\n<p>We're getting there, but in the spectrum of the simulated signal, we\nstill cannot distinguish the peaks at 154 and 159 meters. Who knows\nwhat we're missing in the real-world signal! To sharpen the peaks,\nwe'll return to our toolbox and make use of <em>windowing</em>.</p>\n<!--\n\nThe range traces in Fig. ([fig:Log range traces]) display a further\nserious shortcoming. The signals $v_{1}$ and $v_{5}$ are composed of\npure sinusoids and we would ideally expect the FFT to produce line\nspectra for these signals. The logarithmic plots show steadily\nincreasing values as the peaks are approached from both sides, to such\nan extent that one of the targets in the plot for $|v_{5}|$ can hardly\nbe distinguished even though it is separated by several range bins\nfrom the large target. The broadening is caused by *side lobes* in the\nDFT. These are caused by an inherent clash between the properties of\nthe signal we analyzed and the signal produced by the inverse DFT.\n\n-->\n<p>Here are the signals used thus far in this example, windowed with a\nKaiser window with $\\beta=6.1$:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">f, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, figsize=(4.8, 2.8))\n\nt_ms = t * 1000  # Sample times in milli-second\n\nw = np.kaiser(N, 6.1)  # Kaiser window with beta = 6.1\n\nfor n, (signal, label) in enumerate([(v_single, r'$v_0 [V]$'),\n                                     (v_sim, r'$v_5 [V]$'),\n                                     (v_actual, r'$v_{\\mathrm{actual}} [V]$')]):\n    with plt.style.context('style/thinner.mplstyle'):\n        axes[n].plot(t_ms, w * signal)\n        axes[n].set_ylabel(label)\n        axes[n].grid()\n\naxes[2].set_xlim(0, t_ms[-1])\naxes[2].set_xlabel('Time [ms]');\n</code></pre>\n<!-- caption text=\"Windowed signals for: (a) single simulated target, (b) multiple simulated targets, (c) real targets\" -->\n<p>And the corresponding FFTs (or \"range traces\", in radar terms):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">V_single_win = np.fft.fft(w * v_single)\nV_sim_win = np.fft.fft(w * v_sim)\nV_actual_win = np.fft.fft(w * v_actual)\n\nfig, (ax0, ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(3, 1)\n\nwith plt.style.context('style/thinner.mplstyle'):\n    log_plot_normalized(rng, V_single_win[:N // 2],\n                        r\"$|V_{0,\\mathrm{win}}|$ [dB]\", ax0)\n    log_plot_normalized(rng, V_sim_win[:N // 2],\n                        r\"$|V_{5,\\mathrm{win}}|$ [dB]\", ax1)\n    log_plot_normalized(rng, V_actual_win[:N // 2],\n                        r\"$|V_\\mathrm{actual,win}|$ [dB]\", ax2)\n\nax0.set_xlim(0, 300)  # Change x limits for these plots so that\nax1.set_xlim(0, 300)  # we are better able to see the shape of the peaks.\n\nax1.annotate(\"New, previously unseen!\", (160, -35), xytext=(10, 15),\n             textcoords=\"offset points\", color='red', size='x-small',\n             arrowprops=dict(width=0.5, headwidth=3, headlength=4,\n                             fc='k', shrink=0.1));\n</code></pre>\n<!-- caption text=\"Range traces (spectrum) of windowed signals\" -->\n<p>Compare these with the earlier range traces. There is a dramatic\nlowering in side lobe level, but at a price: the peaks have changed in\nshape, widening and becoming less peaky, thus lowering the radar\nresolution, that is, the ability of the radar to distinguish between\ntwo closely space targets. The choice of window is a compromise\nbetween side lobe level and resolution. Even so, referring to the\ntrace for $V_\\mathrm{sim}$, windowing has dramatically increased our\nability to distinguish the small target from its large neighbor.</p>\n<p>In the real radar data range trace windowing has also reduced the side\nlobes. This is most visible in the depth of the notch between the two\ngroups of targets.</p>\n<h3>Radar Images</h3>\n<p>Knowing how to analyze a single trace, we can expand to looking at\nradar images.</p>\n<p>The data is produced by a radar with a parabolic reflector antenna. It\nproduces a highly directive round pencil beam with a $2^\\circ$\nspreading angle between half-power points. When directed with normal\nincidence at a plane, the radar will illuminate a spot of about $2$ meters in\ndiameter at a distance of 60 meters.\nOutside this spot, the power drops off quite rapidly, but strong\nechoes from outside the spot will nevertheless still be visible.</p>\n<p>By varying the pencil beam's azimuth (left-right position) and\nelevation (up-down position), we can sweep it across the target area\nof interest. When reflections are picked up, we can calculate the\ndistance to the reflector (the object hit by the radar signal).\nTogether with the current pencil beam azimuth and elevation, this\ndefines the reflector's position in 3D.</p>\n<p>A rock slope consists of thousands of reflectors. A range bin can be\nthought of as a large sphere with the radar at its center that\nintersects the slope along a ragged line. The scatterers on this line\nwill produce reflections in this range bin. The wavelength of the\nradar (distance the transmitted wave travels in one oscillation\nsecond) is about 30 mm. The reflections from scatterers separated by\nodd multiples of a quarter wavelength in range, about 7.5 mm, will\ntend to interfere destructively, while those from scatterers separated\nby multiples of a half wavelength will tend to interfere\nconstructively at the radar. The reflections combine to produce\napparent spots of strong reflections. This specific radar moves its\nantenna in order to scan small regions consisting of $20^\\circ$\nazimuth and $30^\\circ$ elevation bins scanned in steps of $0.5^\\circ$.</p>\n<p>We will now draw some contour plots of the resulting radar data.\nPlease refer to the diagram below to see how the different slices are\ntaken. A first slice at fixed range shows the strength of echoes\nagainst elevation and azimuth. Another two slices at fixed elevation\nand azimuth respectively shows the slope.

For example, any voice assistant detects, authenticates and interprets commands from humans even if it is slow or fast. Our voice tone tends to be different during different times of the day. In the early morning after we get up from bed, we interact with a slower, heavier and lazier tone compared to other times of the day. These devices treat the signals as time series and compare the peaks, troughs and slopes by taking into account the varying lags and phases in the signals to come up with a similarity score. One of the most common algorithms used to accomplish this is <em>Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)</em>. It is a very robust technique to compare two or more Time Series by ignoring any shifts and speed.</p>\n<p>As part of Walmart Real Estate team, I am working on understanding the energy consumption pattern of different assets like refrigeration units, dehumidifiers, lighting, etc. installed in the retail stores.This will help in improving quality of data collected from IoT sensors, detect and prevent faults in the systems and improve energy consumption forecasting and planning. This analysis involves time series of energy consumption during different times of a day i.e. different days of a week, weeks of a month and months of a year. Time series forecasting often gives bad predictions when there is sudden shift in phase of the energy consumption due to unknown factors. For example if the defrost schedule, items refresh routine for a refrigeration unit, or weather changes suddenly and are not captured to explain the phase shifts of energy consumption, it is important to detect these change points.</p>\n<p>In the example below, the items refresh routine of a store has shifted by 2 hours on Tuesday leading the shift in peak energy consumption of refrigeration units and this information was not available to us for many such stores.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*WEe7LQivzU4YOvDCe0_P_A.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*WEe7LQivzU4YOvDCe0_P_A.png\"></p>\n<p>The peak at 2 am got shifted to 4 am.

The setup improved the predictions substantially ( > 50%) for the stores for which the reason of shift was not known. This was not possible by traditional ways of one to one comparison of signals.</p>\n<p>In this blog, I will explain how DTW algorithm works and throw some light on the calculation of the similarity score between two time series and its implementation in python.

It is a method to calculate the optimal matching between two sequences. DTW is useful in many domains such as speech recognition, data mining, financial markets, etc. It's commonly used in data mining to measure the distance between two time-series.</p>\n<p>In this post, we will go over the mathematics behind DTW. Then, two illustrative examples are provided to better understand the concept. If you are not interested in the math behind it, please jump to examples.</p>\n<h1>Formulation</h1>\n<p>Let's assume we have two sequences like the following:</p>\n<p><em>𝑋=𝑥[1], 𝑥[2], ..., x[i], ..., x[n]</em></p>\n<p><em>Y=y[1], y[2], ..., y[j], ..., y[m]</em></p>\n<p>The sequences 𝑋 and 𝑌 can be arranged to form an 𝑛-by-𝑚 grid, where each point (𝑖, j) is the alignment between 𝑥[𝑖] and 𝑦[𝑗].</p>\n<p>A warping path 𝑊 maps the elements of 𝑋 and 𝑌 to minimize the <em>distance</em> between them. 𝑊 is a sequence of grid points (𝑖, 𝑗). We will see an example of the warping path later.</p>\n<h2>Warping Path and DTW distance</h2>\n<p>The Optimal path to (𝑖<em>𝑘, 𝑗</em>𝑘) can be computed by:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*8hJEJWuxrccwCMuUG_aPbQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*8hJEJWuxrccwCMuUG_aPbQ.png\"></p>\n<p>where 𝑑 is the Euclidean distance. Then, the overall path cost can be calculated as</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2OGDOJ-a0zTO_9T1FIGejQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/272/1*2OGDOJ-a0zTO_9T1FIGejQ.png\"></p>\n<h1>Restrictions on the Warping function</h1>\n<p>The warping path is found using a dynamic programming approach to align two sequences. Going through all possible paths is \"combinatorically explosive\" [1]. Therefore, for efficiency purposes, it's important to limit the number of possible warping paths, and hence the following constraints are outlined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boundary Condition: This constraint ensures that the warping path begins with the start points of both signals and terminates with their endpoints.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SHsmQu2TqpaDyIArn2snzg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/452/1*SHsmQu2TqpaDyIArn2snzg.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monotonicity condition: This constraint preserves the time-order of points (not going back in time).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*RNg2VENGaWoyvGrvyeg61A.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/311/1*RNg2VENGaWoyvGrvyeg61A.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuity (step size) condition: This constraint limits the path transitions to adjacent points in time (not jumping in time).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lU99pFyomdPeaHuR26bDyA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/418/1*lU99pFyomdPeaHuR26bDyA.png\"></p>\n<p>In addition to the above three constraints, there are other less frequent conditions for an allowable warping path:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warping window condition: Allowable points can be restricted to fall within a given warping window of width 𝜔 (a positive integer).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9apgwkXeU3gOHLudFsIosA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/168/1*9apgwkXeU3gOHLudFsIosA.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slope condition: The warping path can be constrained by restricting the slope, and consequently avoiding extreme movements in one direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An acceptable warping path has combinations of chess king moves that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Horizontal moves: (𝑖, 𝑗) → (𝑖, 𝑗+1)</li>\n<li>Vertical moves: (𝑖, 𝑗) → (𝑖+1, 𝑗)</li>\n<li>Diagonal moves: (𝑖, 𝑗) → (𝑖+1, 𝑗+1)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Implementation</h1>\n<p>Let's import all python packages we need.</p>\n<p>import pandas as pd<br>\nimport numpy as np# Plotting Packages<br>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>\nimport seaborn as sbn# Configuring Matplotlib<br>\nimport matplotlib as mpl<br>\nmpl.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 300<br>\nsavefig<em>options = dict(format=\"png\", dpi=300, bbox</em>inches=\"tight\")# Computation packages<br>\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean<br>\nfrom fastdtw import fastdtw</p>\n<p>Let's define a method to compute the accumulated cost matrix <em>D</em> for the warp path. The cost matrix uses the Euclidean distance to calculate the distance between every two points. The methods to compute the Euclidean distance matrix and accumulated cost matrix are defined below:</p>\n<h1>Example 1</h1>\n<p>In this example, we have two sequences <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> with different lengths.</p>\n<h1>Create two sequences\\</h1>\n<p>x = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1]<br>\ny = [2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 0]</p>\n<p>We cannot calculate the Euclidean distance between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> since they don't have equal lengths.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ADzLGLGGq13onO72EO_ZpQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*ADzLGLGGq13onO72EO_ZpQ.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 1: Euclidean distance between x and y (is it possible? 🤔) (Image by Author)</p>\n<h1>Compute DTW distance and warp path</h1>\n<p>Many Python packages calculate the DTW by just providing the sequences and the type of distance (usually Euclidean). Here, we use a popular Python implementation of DTW that is <a href=\"https://github.com/slaypni/fastdtw\">FastDTW</a> which is an approximate DTW algorithm with lower time and memory complexities [2].</p>\n<p>dtw<em>distance, warp</em>path = fastdtw(x, y, dist=euclidean)</p>\n<p>Note that we are using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/scipy/\">SciPy</a>'s distance function <em>Euclidean</em> that we imported earlier. For a better understanding of the warp path, let's first compute the accumulated cost matrix and then visualize the path on a grid. The following code will plot a heatmap of the accumulated cost matrix.</p>\n<p>cost<em>matrix = compute</em>accumulated<em>cost</em>matrix(x, y)</p>\n<p>Example 1: Python code to plot (and save) the heatmap of the accumulated cost matrix</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/54/1*PIKZAwsV15NBvqkh9N1KMg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/375/1*PIKZAwsV15NBvqkh9N1KMg.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 1: Accumulated cost matrix and warping path (Image by Author)</p>\n<p>The color bar shows the cost of each point in the grid. As can be seen, the warp path (blue line) is going through the lowest cost on the grid. Let's see the DTW distance and the warping path by printing these two variables.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DTW distance: 6.0<br>\nWarp path: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The warping path starts at point (0, 0) and ends at (4, 6) by 6 moves. Let's also calculate the accumulated cost most using the functions we defined earlier and compare the values with the heatmap.</p>\n<p>cost<em>matrix = compute</em>accumulated<em>cost</em>matrix(x, y)<br>\nprint(np.flipud(cost_matrix)) # Flipping the cost matrix for easier comparison with heatmap values!>>> [[32. 12. 10. 10.  6.]<br>\n[23. 11.  6.  6.  5.]<br>\n[19. 11.  5.  5.  9.]<br>\n[19.  7.  4.  5.  8.]<br>\n[19.  3.  6. 10.  4.]<br>\n[10.  2.  6.  6.  3.]<br>\n[ 1.  2.  2.  2.  3.]]</p>\n<p>The cost matrix is printed above has similar values to the heatmap.</p>\n<p>Now let's plot the two sequences and connect the mapping points. The code to plot the DTW distance between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is given below.</p>\n<p>Example 1: Python code to plot (and save) the DTW distance between x and y</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bF9I-49iVW9b2MvDbRBZxA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*bF9I-49iVW9b2MvDbRBZxA.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 1: DTW distance between x and y (Image by Author)</p>\n<h1>Example 2</h1>\n<p>In this example, we will use two sinusoidal signals and see how they will be matched by calculating the DTW distance between them.</p>\n<p>Example 2: Generate two sinusoidal signals (x1 and x2) with different lengths</p>\n<p>Just like Example 1, let's calculate the DTW distance and the warp path for *x1 *and *x2 *signals using FastDTW package.</p>\n<p>distance, warp_path = fastdtw(x1, x2, dist=euclidean)</p>\n<p>Example 2: Python code to plot (and save) the DTW distance between x1 and x2</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Bzubc5uGFXd_-Sj7W_QFjg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*Bzubc5uGFXd_-Sj7W_QFjg.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 2: DTW distance between x1 and x2 (Image by Author)</p>\n<p>As can be seen in above figure, the DTW distance between the two signals is particularly powerful when the signals have similar patterns. The extrema (maximum and minimum points) between the two signals are correctly mapped. Moreover, unlike Euclidean distance, we may see many-to-one mapping when DTW distance is used, particularly if the two signals have different lengths.</p>\n<p>You may spot an issue with dynamic time warping from the figure above. Can you guess what it is?</p>\n<p>The issue is around the head and tail of time-series that do not properly match. This is because the DTW algorithm cannot afford the warping invariance for at the endpoints. In short, the effect of this is that a small difference at the sequence endpoints will tend to contribute disproportionately to the estimated similarity[3].</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>DTW is an algorithm to find an optimal alignment between two sequences and a useful distance metric to have in our toolbox. This technique is useful when we are working with two non-linear sequences, particularly if one sequence is a non-linear stretched/shrunk version of the other. The warping path is a combination of \"chess king\" moves that starts from the head of two sequences and ends with their tails.</p>\n<p>You can find the Jupyter notebook for this blog post <a href=\"https://github.com/e-alizadeh/medium/blob/master/notebooks/intro_to_dtw.ipynb\">here</a>.

Dynamic Time Warping is used to compare the similarity or calculate the distance between two arrays or time series with different length.</p>\n<p>Suppose we want to calculate the distance of two equal-length arrays:</p>\n<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>\nb = [3, 2, 2]</p>\n<p>How to do that? One obvious way is to match up <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in 1-to-1 fashion and sum up the total distance of each component. This sounds easy, but what if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have different lengths?</p>\n<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>\nb = [2, 2, 2, 3, 4]</p>\n<p>How to match them up? Which should map to which? To solve the problem, there comes dynamic time warping. Just as its name indicates, to warp the series so that they can match up.</p>\n<h1>Use Cases</h1>\n<p>Before digging into the algorithm, you might have the question that is it useful? Do we really need to compare the distance between two unequal-length time series?</p>\n<p>Yes, in a lot of scenarios DTW is playing a key role.</p>\n<h2>Sound Pattern Recognition</h2>\n<p>One use case is to detect the sound pattern of the same kind. Suppose we want to recognise the voice of a person by analysing his sound track, and we are able to collect his sound track of saying <code>Hello</code> in one scenario. However, people speak in the same word in different ways, what if he speaks hello in a much slower pace like <code>Heeeeeeelloooooo</code> , we will need an algorithm to match up the sound track of different lengths and be able to identify they come from the same person.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*gi1TtOqFCsb2M_U7iAUAag.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*gi1TtOqFCsb2M_U7iAUAag.png\"></p>\n<h2>Stock Market</h2>\n<p>In a stock market, people always hope to be able to predict the future, however using general machine learning algorithms can be exhaustive, as most prediction task requires test and training set to have the same dimension of features. However, if you ever speculate in the stock market, you will know that even the same pattern of a stock can have very different length reflection on klines and indicators.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*4QUO4Tqm_z-8ydMBGgqmPg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*4QUO4Tqm_z-8ydMBGgqmPg.png\"></p>\n<h1>Definition &#x26; Idea</h1>\n<p>A concise explanation of DTW from wiki,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In time series analysis, dynamic time warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed. DTW has been applied to temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphics data --- indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear sequence can be analysed with DTW.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>The idea to compare arrays with different length is to build one-to-many and many-to-one matches so that the total distance can be minimised between the two.</em></p>\n<p>Suppose we have two different arrays red and blue with different length:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/42/1*uFicSZjqkNBfsyrsJw7J9g.jpeg?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/612/1*uFicSZjqkNBfsyrsJw7J9g.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>Clearly these two series follow the same pattern, but the blue curve is longer than the red. If we apply the one-to-one match, shown in the top, the mapping is not perfectly synced up and the tail of the blue curve is being left out.</p>\n<p>DTW overcomes the issue by developing a one-to-many match so that the troughs and peaks with the same pattern are perfectly matched, and there is no left out for both curves(shown in the bottom top).</p>\n<h1>Rules</h1>\n<p>In general, DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g. time series) with certain restriction and rules(comes from wiki):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every index from the first sequence must be matched with one or more indices from the other sequence and vice versa</li>\n<li>The first index from the first sequence must be matched with the first index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)</li>\n<li>The last index from the first sequence must be matched with the last index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)</li>\n<li>The mapping of the indices from the first sequence to indices from the other sequence must be monotonically increasing, and vice versa, i.e. if <code>j > i</code> are indices from the first sequence, then there must not be two indices <code>l > k</code> in the other sequence, such that index <code>i</code> is matched with index <code>l</code> and index <code>j</code> is matched with index <code>k</code> , and vice versa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The optimal match is denoted by the match that satisfies all the restrictions and the rules and that has the minimal cost, where the cost is computed as the sum of absolute differences, for each matched pair of indices, between their values.</p>\n<p>To summarise is that <em>head and tail must be positionally matched, no cross-match and no left out.</em></p>\n<h1>Implementation</h1>\n<p>The implementation of the algorithm looks extremely concise:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*fGr2Mj7fEB7tEyqAzcp2LA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*fGr2Mj7fEB7tEyqAzcp2LA.png\"></p>\n<p>where <code>DTW[i, j]</code> is the distance between <code>s[1:i]</code> and <code>t[1:j]</code> with the best alignment.</p>\n<p>The key lies in:</p>\n<p>DTW[i, j] := cost + minimum(DTW[i-1, j ],<br>\nDTW[i , j-1],<br>\nDTW[i-1, j-1])</p>\n<p>Which is saying that the cost of between two arrays with length <code>i and j</code> equals <em>the distance between the tails + the minimum of cost in arrays with length *`</em>i-1, j<em><code>_ , _</code></em>i, j-1<em><code>_ , and _</code></em>i-1, j-1*`_ ._</p>\n<p>Put it in python would be:</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*eogOkXkOUzi6Cq7U9BgiLg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*eogOkXkOUzi6Cq7U9BgiLg.png\"></p>\n<p>The distance between <code>a and b</code> would be the last element of the matrix, which is 2.</p>\n<h2>Add Window Constraint</h2>\n<p>One issue of the above algorithm is that we allow one element in an array to match an unlimited number of elements in the other array(as long as the tail can match in the end), this would cause the mapping to bent over a lot, for example, the following array:</p>\n<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>\nb = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, ..., 5]</p>\n<p>To minimise the distance, the element 2 in array <code>a</code> would match all the 2 in array <code>b</code> , which causes an array <code>b</code> to bent severely. To avoid this, we can add a window constraint to limit the number of elements one can match:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*0_xypte7FHDWJuuBexEvHg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*0_xypte7FHDWJuuBexEvHg.png\"></p>\n<p>The key difference is that now each element is confined to match elements in range <code>i --- w</code> and <code>i + w</code> . The <code>w := max(w, abs(n-m))</code> guarantees all indices can be matched up.</p>\n<p>The implementation and example would be:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2K6C-3QrRmbbhpe-jt9UQA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*2K6C-3QrRmbbhpe-jt9UQA.png\"></p>\n<h1>Apply a Package</h1>\n<p>There is also contributed packages available on Pypi to use directly. Here I demonstrate an example using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/fastdtw/\">fastdtw</a>:</p>\n<p>It gives you the distance of two lists and index mapping(the example can extend to a multi-dimension array).</p>"},{"url":"/docs/audio/dynamic-time-warping/","relativePath":"docs/audio/dynamic-time-warping.md","relativeDir":"docs/audio","base":"dynamic-time-warping.md","name":"dynamic-time-warping","frontmatter":{"title":"dynamic-time-warping","weight":0,"excerpt":"dynamic-time-warping","seo":{"title":"dynamic-time-warping","description":"dynamic-time-warping","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>Dynamic Time Warping Triggered Guitar Effects Project:</h1>\n<h1>DTW Algorithm:</h1>\n<iframe src=\"https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=D21009FDD967A241&amp;resid=D21009FDD967A241%21634692&amp;authkey=AHfsGpj1Un3UNuE&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777\" width=\"962px\" height=\"565px\" frameborder=\"0\">This is an embedded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://office.com\">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://office.com/webapps\">Office</a>.</iframe>\n<hr>\n<h1>Project:</h1>\n<iframe src=\"https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=D21009FDD967A241%21608188&amp;authkey=%21AL1vMFzOuqvFbUY&amp;em=2&amp;wdAr=1.7777777777777777\" width=\"962px\" height=\"565px\" frameborder=\"0\">This is an embedded <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://office.com\">Microsoft Office</a> presentation, powered by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://office.com/webapps\">Office</a>.</iframe>"},{"url":"/docs/audio/","relativePath":"docs/audio/index.md","relativeDir":"docs/audio","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Audio","weight":0,"excerpt":"Audio Projects and tools / web audio daw","seo":{"title":"Audio Projects","description":"A collection of web audio projects","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"\nsrc=\"https://bgoonz.github.io/extracting-features-from-audio/\"></iframe>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"0\"\nsrc=\"https://observablehq.com/embed/@bgoonz/mode-lighting/2?cell=*\"></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n    <iframe\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"1000\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      src=\"https://observablehq.com/embed/@bgoonz/determining-the-key-of-bwv1001-1st-movement-adagio?cell=*\"\n    ></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n    <iframe\n      width=\"100%\"\n      height=\"784\"\n      frameborder=\"0\"\n      src=\"https://observablehq.com/embed/@bgoonz/can-sound-add-value-to-data-visualizations?cells=viewof+chart\"\n    ></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>"},{"url":"/docs/audio/web-audio-api/","relativePath":"docs/audio/web-audio-api.md","relativeDir":"docs/audio","base":"web-audio-api.md","name":"web-audio-api","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Apis","weight":0,"excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>Web Audio Api</h2>\n<h1>Basic concepts behind Web Audio API</h1>\n<p>This article explains some of the audio theory behind how the features of the Web Audio API work, to help you make informed decisions while designing how audio is routed through your app.</p>\n<p>It won't turn you into a master sound engineer, but it will give you enough background to understand why the Web Audio API works like it does.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#audio_graphs\" title=\"Permalink to Audio graphs\">Audio graphs</a></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API\">Web Audio API</a> involves handling audio operations inside an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext\">audio context</a>, and has been designed to allow <strong>modular routing</strong>. Basic audio operations are performed with <strong>audio nodes</strong>, which are linked together to form an <strong>audio routing graph</strong>. Several sources --- with different types of channel layout --- are supported even within a single context. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.</p>\n<p>Audio nodes are linked via their inputs and outputs, forming a chain that starts with one or more sources, goes through one or more nodes, then ends up at a destination. Although, you don't have to provide a destination if you, say, just want to visualize some audio data. A simple, typical workflow for web audio would look something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create the audio context.</li>\n<li>Inside the context, create sources --- such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio\"><code>&#x3C;audio></code></a>, oscillator, or stream.</li>\n<li>Create effects nodes, such as reverb, biquad filter, panner, or compressor.</li>\n<li>Choose the final destination for the audio, such as the user's computer speakers.</li>\n<li>Establish connections from the audio sources through zero or more effects, eventually ending at the chosen destination.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The number of audio channels available on a signal is frequently presented in a numeric format, such as 2.0 or 5.1. This is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound#Channel_notation\" title=\"channel notation\">channel notation</a>. The first number is the number of full frequency range audio channels that the signal includes. The number after the period indicates the number of those channels which are reserved for low-frequency effect (LFE) outputs; these are often referred to as <strong>subwoofers</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API/webaudioapi_en.svg\" alt=\"A simple box diagram with an outer box labeled Audio context, and three inner boxes labeled Sources, Effects and Destination.

A frame, or sample frame, is the set of all values for all channels that will play at a specific point in time: all the samples of all the channels that play at the same time (two for a stereo sound, six for 5.1, etc.)</p>\n<p>The sample rate is the number of those samples (or frames, since all samples of a frame play at the same time) that will play in one second, measured in Hz. The higher the sample rate, the better the sound quality.</p>\n<p>Let's look at a Mono and a Stereo audio buffer, each is one second long, and playing at 44100Hz:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Mono buffer will have 44100 samples, and 44100 frames. The <code>length</code> property will be 44100.</li>\n<li>The Stereo buffer will have 88200 samples, but still 44100 frames. The <code>length</code> property will still be 44100 since it's equal to the number of frames.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API/sampleframe-english.png\" alt=\"A diagram showing several frames in an audio buffer in a long line, each one containing two samples, as the buffer has two channels, it is stereo.\"></p>\n<p>When a buffer plays, you will hear the left most sample frame, and then the one right next to it, etc. In the case of stereo, you will hear both channels at the same time. Sample frames are very useful, because they are independent of the number of channels, and represent time, in a useful way for doing precise audio manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> To get a time in seconds from a frame count, divide the number of frames by the sample rate. To get a number of frames from a number of samples, divide by the channel count.</p>\n<p>Here's a couple of simple examples:</p>\n<pre><code>var context = new AudioContext();\nvar buffer = context.createBuffer(2, 22050, 44100);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio\" title=\"Digital audio\">digital audio</a>, <strong>44,100 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz\">Hz</a></strong> (alternately represented as <strong>44.1 kHz</strong>) is a common <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_frequency\" title=\"Sampling frequency\">sampling frequency</a>. Why 44.1kHz?</p>\n<p>Firstly, because the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range\" title=\"Hearing range\">hearing range</a> of human ears is roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Via the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem\" title=\"Nyquist--Shannon sampling theorem\">Nyquist--Shannon sampling theorem</a>, the sampling frequency must be greater than twice the maximum frequency one wishes to reproduce. Therefore, the sampling rate has to be greater than 40 kHz.</p>\n<p>Secondly, signals must be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter\" title=\"Low-pass filter\">low-pass filtered</a> before sampling, otherwise <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing\">aliasing</a> occurs. While an ideal low-pass filter would perfectly pass frequencies below 20 kHz (without attenuating them) and perfectly cut off frequencies above 20 kHz, in practice a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_band\" title=\"Transition band\">transition band</a> is necessary, where frequencies are partly attenuated. The wider this transition band is, the easier and more economical it is to make an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing_filter\" title=\"Anti-aliasing filter\">anti-aliasing filter</a>. The 44.1 kHz sampling frequency allows for a 2.05 kHz transition band.</p>\n<p>If you use this call above, you will get a stereo buffer with two channels, that when played back on an AudioContext running at 44100Hz (very common, most normal sound cards run at this rate), will last for 0.5 seconds: 22050 frames/44100Hz = 0.5 seconds.</p>\n<pre><code>var context = new AudioContext();\nvar buffer = context.createBuffer(1, 22050, 22050);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you use this call, you will get a mono buffer with just one channel), that when played back on an AudioContext running at 44100Hz, will be automatically <em>resampled</em> to 44100Hz (and therefore yield 44100 frames), and last for 1.0 second: 44100 frames/44100Hz = 1 second.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Audio resampling is very similar to image resizing. Say you've got a 16 x 16 image, but you want it to fill a 32x32 area. You resize (or resample) it. The result has less quality (it can be blurry or edgy, depending on the resizing algorithm), but it works, with the resized image taking up less space. Resampled audio is exactly the same: you save space, but in practice you will be unable to properly reproduce high frequency content, or treble sound.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#planar_versus_interleaved_buffers\" title=\"Permalink to Planar versus interleaved buffers\">Planar versus interleaved buffers</a></h3>\n<p>The Web Audio API uses a planar buffer format. The left and right channels are stored like this:</p>\n<p>LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR (for a buffer of 16 frames)</p>\n<p>This is very common in audio processing: it makes it easy to process each channel independently.</p>\n<p>The alternative is to use an interleaved buffer format:</p>\n<p>LRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLR (for a buffer of 16 frames)</p>\n<p>This format is very common for storing and playing back audio without much processing, for example a decoded MP3 stream.</p>\n<p>The Web Audio API exposes <strong>only</strong> planar buffers, because it's made for processing. It works with planar, but converts the audio to interleaved when it is sent to the sound card for playback. Conversely, when an MP3 is decoded, it starts off in interleaved format, but is converted to planar for processing.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#audio_channels\" title=\"Permalink to Audio channels\">Audio channels</a></h2>\n<p>Different audio buffers contain different numbers of channels: from the more basic mono (only one channel) and stereo (left and right channels), to more complex sets like quad and 5.1, which have different sound samples contained in each channel, leading to a richer sound experience. The channels are usually represented by standard abbreviations detailed in the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Channels</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Mono</em></td>\n<td><code>0: M: mono</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Stereo</em></td>\n<td><code>0: L: left 1: R: right</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Quad</em></td>\n<td><code>0: L: left 1: R: right 2: SL: surround left 3: SR: surround right</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>5.1</em></td>\n<td><code>0: L: left 1: R: right 2: C: center 3: LFE: subwoofer 4: SL: surround left 5: SR: surround right</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#up-mixing_and_down-mixing\" title=\"Permalink to Up-mixing and down-mixing\">Up-mixing and down-mixing</a></h3>\n<p>When the number of channels doesn't match between an input and an output, up- or down-mixing happens according the following rules.

This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.</p>\n<p>Audio nodes are linked into chains and simple webs by their inputs and outputs. They typically start with one or more sources. Sources provide arrays of sound intensities (samples) at very small timeslices, often tens of thousands of them per second. These could be either computed mathematically (such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode\"><code>OscillatorNode</code></a>), or they can be recordings from sound/video files (like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode\"><code>AudioBufferSourceNode</code></a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaElementAudioSourceNode\"><code>MediaElementAudioSourceNode</code></a>) and audio streams (<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamAudioSourceNode\"><code>MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</code></a>). In fact, sound files are just recordings of sound intensities themselves, which come in from microphones or electric instruments, and get mixed down into a single, complicated wave.</p>\n<p>Outputs of these nodes could be linked to inputs of others, which mix or modify these streams of sound samples into different streams. A common modification is multiplying the samples by a value to make them louder or quieter (as is the case with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GainNode\"><code>GainNode</code></a>). Once the sound has been sufficiently processed for the intended effect, it can be linked to the input of a destination (<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/destination\"><code>BaseAudioContext.destination</code></a>), which sends the sound to the speakers or headphones.

There were times I had to restart Chrome to get Hangouts to work again.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Request for the option to interview over Hangouts/Skype instead of a phone call; it is easier to send links or text across.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Decide on and be familiar with a programming language.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Familiarize yourself with the coding environment (CoderPad/CodePen). Set up the coding shortcuts, turn on autocompletion, tab spacing, etc.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Prepare answers to the <a href=\"behavioral-questions.md\">frequently-asked behavioral questions</a> in an interview.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Prepare some <a href=\"questions-to-ask.md\">questions to ask</a> at the end of the interview.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Dress comfortably. Usually you do not need to wear smart clothes, casual should be fine. T-shirts and jeans are acceptable at most places.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Stay calm and composed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>⚠️</td>\n<td>Turn off the webcam if possible.

Many questions are under-specified on purpose. E.g. a tree-like diagram could very well be a graph that allows for cycles and a naive recursive solution would not work.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Clarify input format and range.

Too slow is no good.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>As much as possible, write actual compilable code, not pseudocode.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Write in a modular fashion. Extract out chunks of repeated code into functions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Ask for permission to use trivial functions without having to implement them; saves you some time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Use the hints given by the interviewer.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Demonstrate mastery of your chosen programming language.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Demonstrate technical knowledge in data structures and algorithms.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>If you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer and say what you would do in a non-interview setting (no time constraints).

Developers","weight":0,"excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>1. Why are frameworks useful?</h2>\n<p>Essentially the allure of these is the amount of time that is saved and the resulting efficiency in getting a project rolled out faster because there's a lot less of the initial work to be done.</p>\n<p>Frameworks take care of tasks like default browser settings, file structures, and layout templates for your website. This automation generates a uniform design for page elements like text, tables, forms, and buttons, amongst other things. Even complex navigation menus become standardized with frameworks as it can be consistently applied across your website with ease.</p>\n<h2>2. Types of framework</h2>\n<p>There are many different kinds of this platform available for programmers. Typically, like a lot of things within this discipline can be split between <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/whats-the-difference-between-frontend-and-backend/\">frontend and backend development</a>---first let's make the distinction between the two to help you understand the usefulness of these solutions.</p>\n<h3>Backend frameworks</h3>\n<p>These are designed to make the responsibility of interacting with the database an easier endeavor for the developer. It automates a lot of functions and processes that web developers use to record and retrieve user-inputted data.</p>\n<h3>Frontend frameworks</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, these are very helpful on the presentation side of the website, creating a good foundation from which to build pages. These frameworks combine HTML, CSS, and <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-javascript/\">Javascript</a> to be really effective in creating conventions for various elements. Typically frontend web developers use them in conjunction with <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/7-essential-tools-for-front-end-development/\">other effective tools</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-html-a-beginners-guide/\">HTML</a> conventions allow for standardization for elements like typography, while <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-css/\">CSS</a> conventions can help standardize positioning of elements in a grid-like system on the pages. This makes it easier for the developer to arrange and organize elements into a simple and uniform design across multiple displays and browsers. Javascript conventions offer the ability to style more advanced components like image carousels, lightboxes, button behaviors, and pop-ups.</p>\n<p>On another note, there are Javascript frameworks that focus on full application support---like AngularJS and Reactjs. Libraries of Javascript code like <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/javascript-vs-jquery-whats-the-difference/\">jQuery</a> are also helpful in developing conventions that can be readily implemented in websites.</p>\n<p>To recap, the use of these tools helps the developer get up and running quickly without having to get bogged down with the initial hurdles that come with setting up a website. It creates uniform code across all pages of your website and presents a clean look for users. This in turn solves common issues like typography consistency and positioning difficulties on different pages.</p>\n<p>Best of all, frontend frameworks resolve any issues with browser compatibility and are key to responsive web design, which we'll discuss further on.</p>\n<h4>Curious about a career in Web Development?</h4>\n<p>Start learning for free!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/short-courses/become-a-web-developer/?popup-tracking=blog-inline-DEV\"><img src=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/web-image@3x.jpg\"></a></p>\n<h2>3. Popular frameworks</h2>\n<p>There are many of these tools that have become must-haves for beginner and expert web developers alike. As well as different languages, they focus on different directives and outcomes.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular frameworks is <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-bootstrap-a-beginners-guide/\">Bootstrap, which was originally developed by Twitter</a> to maintain consistency in their interface development. It's very polished and efficient, and makes website development easier and faster. It has standardized conventions that are well recognized for HTML elements like buttons, alerts, forms, and typography.</p>\n<p>So popular that it's now known simply as \"Rails,\" <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/should-i-learn-ruby-on-rails/\">Ruby on Rails </a>has revolutionised this language. As well as making it one of the <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/easiest-programming-languages/\">easier programming languages to learn</a>, Rails is particularly popular with beginners looking to code full-stack early on in their careers.</p>\n<p>Foundation was created from the Zurb style guide and much like Bootstrap, offers a complete solution for front-end design. Many large companies like Facebook, Yahoo, and Ebay utilize Foundation in their layouts. The framework encourages web developers to expand on the conventions and personalize them for developers' websites.</p>\n<p>Skeleton is a lighter example that doesn't come with all the bells and whistles that accompany the heavy-lifters like Bootstrap and Foundation. This encourages greater customization by only providing styling on the most basic and necessary elements. Developers who only need specific components to be styled utilize light-weight frameworks like Skeleton to achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>A simple Google search will turn up a lot of results for top tools being used and recommended. It's definitely beneficial to check out the different options and see which suits your development needs and design goals.</p>\n<h2>4. How do I use frameworks?</h2>\n<p>Regardless of whether a developer uses a full frontend framework like Bootstrap or a lightweight option like Skeleton, these are efficient tools that should be seriously considered in every developer's process.</p>\n<p>Recognized frameworks offer more ease in collaboration as developers can access the same libraries for design conventions without having to resort to individual opinionated decisions. Additionally, there is support from the specific community with tutorials and articles on how to effectively use it.</p>\n<p>The ease of implementation and efficiency makes it almost a necessity to employ these tools in a web developer's process. Any time a programmer is finding themselves creating an ever-growing proprietary list of CSS rules, it's probably a good idea to look into using a framework to tidy things up.</p>\n<h2>5. What is a responsive framework?</h2>\n<p>One of the best features of these systems is that they help create websites that are easily accessible and are able to be viewed across different browsers on different devices. A lot of frameworks accomplish this with dynamic code---utilizing classes that can be reused and formatted to take into consideration the device and/or browser that is being used.</p>\n<p>In other words, the layouts of webpages will change---certain elements will disappear and text will be smaller on smaller screens, while certain Javascript elements might not take effect at all. On larger screens, the extra real estate can be used to showcase higher quality images and more sophisticated design elements, as well as allowing for the white space beloved by web designers.</p>\n<p>In this current age when users are <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/\">more likely to view websites on their mobile devices</a> than their computers, it's important to have a mobile responsive website that creates an enriching user experience no matter what interface the user interacts with. In this video, our in-house web developer Abhi explains more about styling a mobile-responsive website with CSS:</p>\n<h2>6. Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Critics of frontend frameworks cite them as the source of a lot of cookie-cutter websites that are identical in appearance and interaction. This however, is an oversimplification. Why? Let's go back to the cooking example: a spatula is just a spatula---a lot of people have one and use the tool in the kitchen. But the food that is created will vary wildly across the spectrum, depending on the cook.</p>\n<p>In the same light, frontend frameworks are simply a tool that can be employed to create diverse and distinctive websites. Yes they're efficient, but it's up to the developer to make sure they're effective.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn some more about web development right now, these articles may interest you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/best-coding-bootcamps/\">A Guide To The Best Web Development Bootcamps And How To Choose One</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/in-demand-web-developer-skills/\">The Most In-Demand Web Developer Skills in 2021</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/5-latest-trends-in-web-development/\">5 Web Development Trends To Watch This Year</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"url":"/docs/community/","relativePath":"docs/community/index.md","relativeDir":"docs/community","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Community","excerpt":"We'd love it if you participate in the Libris community.

As for most of the things in life, you can't have it all, so it is with the data structures. You will generally need to trade some time for space or the other way around.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><em>time</em></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The time complexity for a data structure is in general more diverse than its space complexity.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><em>Several operations</em></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In contrary to algorithms, when you look at the time complexity for data structures you need to express it for several operations that you can do with data structures. It can be adding elements, deleting elements, accessing an element or even searching for an element.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><em>Dependent on data</em></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Something that data structure and algorithms have in common when talking about time complexity is that they are both dealing with data. When you deal with data you become dependent on them and as a result the time complexity is also dependent of the data that you received. To solve this problem we talk about 3 different time complexity.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The best-case complexity: when the data looks the best</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The worst-case complexity: when the data looks the worst</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The average-case complexity: when the data looks average</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Big O notation</h2>\n<p>The complexity is usually expressed with the Big O notation. The wikipedia page about this subject is pretty complex but you can find here a good summary of the different complexity for the most famous data structures and sorting algorithms.</p>\n<h2>The Array data structure</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Qk3UYgeqXamRrFLR.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Definition</h2>\n<p>An Array data structure, or simply an Array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.
