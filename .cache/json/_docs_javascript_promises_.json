In browsers, JavaScript shares a thread with a load of other stuff that differs from browser to browser. But typically JavaScript is in the same queue as painting, updating styles, and handling user actions (such as highlighting text and interacting with form controls). Activity in one of these things delays the others.</p>\n<p>As a human being, you're multithreaded. You can type with multiple fingers, you can drive and hold a conversation at the same time. The only blocking function we have to deal with is sneezing, where all current activity must be suspended for the duration of the sneeze. That's pretty annoying, especially when you're driving and trying to hold a conversation. You don't want to write code that's sneezy.</p>\n<p>You've probably used events and callbacks to get around this. Here are events:</p>\n<pre><code>var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');img1.addEventListener('load', function() {  // woo yey image loaded});img1.addEventListener('error', function() {  // argh everything's broken});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This isn't sneezy at all. We get the image, add a couple of listeners, then JavaScript can stop executing until one of those listeners is called.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the example above, it's possible that the events happened before we started listening for them, so we need to work around that using the \"complete\" property of images:</p>\n<pre><code>var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');function loaded() {  // woo yey image loaded}if (img1.complete) {  loaded();}else {  img1.addEventListener('load', loaded);}img1.addEventListener('error', function() {  // argh everything's broken});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This doesn't catch images that errored before we got a chance to listen for them; unfortunately the DOM doesn't give us a way to do that. Also, this is loading one image. Things get even more complex if we want to know when a set of images have loaded.</p>\n<h2>Events aren't always the best way <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#events-aren&#x27;t-always-the-best-way\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Events are great for things that can happen multiple times on the same object---<code>keyup</code>, <code>touchstart</code> etc. With those events you don't really care about what happened before you attached the listener. But when it comes to async success/failure, ideally you want something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>img1.callThisIfLoadedOrWhenLoaded(function() {  // loaded}).orIfFailedCallThis(function() {  // failed});// and...whenAllTheseHaveLoaded([img1, img2]).callThis(function() {  // all loaded}).orIfSomeFailedCallThis(function() {  // one or more failed});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is what promises do, but with better naming. If HTML image elements had a \"ready\" method that returned a promise, we could do this:</p>\n<pre><code>img1.ready().then(function() {  // loaded}, function() {  // failed});// and...Promise.all([img1.ready(), img2.ready()]).then(function() {  // all loaded}, function() {  // one or more failed});\n</code></pre>\n<p>At their most basic, promises are a bit like event listeners except:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A promise can only succeed or fail once. It cannot succeed or fail twice, neither can it switch from success to failure or vice versa.</li>\n<li>If a promise has succeeded or failed and you later add a success/failure callback, the correct callback will be called, even though the event took place earlier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is extremely useful for async success/failure, because you're less interested in the exact time something became available, and more interested in reacting to the outcome.</p>\n<h2>Promise terminology <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#promise-terminology\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/domenic\">Domenic Denicola</a> proof read the first draft of this article and graded me \"F\" for terminology. He put me in detention, forced me to copy out <a href=\"https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping/blob/master/docs/states-and-fates.md\">States and Fates</a> 100 times, and wrote a worried letter to my parents. Despite that, I still get a lot of the terminology mixed up, but here are the basics:</p>\n<p>A promise can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fulfilled - The action relating to the promise succeeded</li>\n<li>rejected - The action relating to the promise failed</li>\n<li>pending - Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet</li>\n<li>settled - Has fulfilled or rejected</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-promise-objects\">The spec</a> also uses the term thenable to describe an object that is promise-like, in that it has a <code>then</code> method. This term reminds me of ex-England Football Manager <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Venables\">Terry Venables</a> so I'll be using it as little as possible.</p>\n<h2>Promises arrive in JavaScript! <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#promises-arrive-in-javascript!\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Promises have been around for a while in the form of libraries, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kriskowal/q\">Q</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cujojs/when\">when</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211867.aspx\">WinJS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js\">RSVP.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above and JavaScript promises share a common, standardized behaviour called <a href=\"https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec\">Promises/A+</a>. If you're a jQuery user, they have something similar called <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/\">Deferreds</a>. However, Deferreds aren't Promise/A+ compliant, which makes them <a href=\"https://thewayofcode.wordpress.com/tag/jquery-deferred-broken/\">subtly different and less useful</a>, so beware. jQuery also has <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/Types/#Promise\">a Promise type</a>, but this is just a subset of Deferred and has the same issues.</p>\n<p>Although promise implementations follow a standardized behaviour, their overall APIs differ. JavaScript promises are similar in API to RSVP.js. Here's how you create a promise:</p>\n<pre><code>var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  // do a thing, possibly async, then...  if (/* everything turned out fine */) {    resolve(\"Stuff worked!\");  }  else {    reject(Error(\"It broke\"));  }});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The promise constructor takes one argument, a callback with two parameters, resolve and reject. Do something within the callback, perhaps async, then call resolve if everything worked, otherwise call reject.</p>\n<p>Like <code>throw</code> in plain old JavaScript, it's customary, but not required, to reject with an Error object. The benefit of Error objects is they capture a stack trace, making debugging tools more helpful.</p>\n<p>Here's how you use that promise:</p>\n<pre><code>promise.then(function(result) {  console.log(result); // \"Stuff worked!\"}, function(err) {  console.log(err); // Error: \"It broke\"});\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>then()</code> takes two arguments, a callback for a success case, and another for the failure case. Both are optional, so you can add a callback for the success or failure case only.</p>\n<p>JavaScript promises started out in the DOM as \"Futures\", renamed to \"Promises\", and finally moved into JavaScript. Having them in JavaScript rather than the DOM is great because they'll be available in non-browser JS contexts such as Node.js (whether they make use of them in their core APIs is another question).</p>\n<p>Although they're a JavaScript feature, the DOM isn't afraid to use them. In fact, all new DOM APIs with async success/failure methods will use promises. This is happening already with <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/quota/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#idl-def-StorageQuota\">Quota Management</a>, <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-font-loading/#font-face-set-ready\">Font Load Events</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/blob/cf459d473ae09f6994e8539113d277cbd2bce939/service_worker.ts#L17\">ServiceWorker</a>, <a href=\"https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#widl-Navigator-requestMIDIAccess-Promise-MIDIOptions-options\">Web MIDI</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/streams#basereadablestream\">Streams</a>, and more.</p>\n<h2>Browser support &#x26; polyfill <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#browser-support-and-polyfill\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are already implementations of promises in browsers today.</p>\n<p>As of Chrome 32, Opera 19, Firefox 29, Safari 8 &#x26; Microsoft Edge, promises are enabled by default.</p>\n<p>To bring browsers that lack a complete promises implementation up to spec compliance, or add promises to other browsers and Node.js, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/jakearchibald/ES6-Promises#readme\">the polyfill</a> (2k gzipped).</p>\n<h2>Compatibility with other libraries <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#compatibility-with-other-libraries\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The JavaScript promises API will treat anything with a <code>then()</code> method as promise-like (or <code>thenable</code> in promise-speak <em>sigh</em>), so if you use a library that returns a Q promise, that's fine, it'll play nice with the new JavaScript promises.</p>\n<p>Although, as I mentioned, jQuery's Deferreds are a bit ... unhelpful. Thankfully you can cast them to standard promises, which is worth doing as soon as possible:</p>\n<pre><code>var jsPromise = Promise.resolve($.ajax('/whatever.json'))\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, jQuery's <code>$.ajax</code> returns a Deferred. Since it has a <code>then()</code> method, <code>Promise.resolve()</code> can turn it into a JavaScript promise. However, sometimes deferreds pass multiple arguments to their callbacks, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>var jqDeferred = $.ajax('/whatever.json');jqDeferred.then(function(response, statusText, xhrObj) {  // ...}, function(xhrObj, textStatus, err) {  // ...})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whereas JS promises ignore all but the first:</p>\n<pre><code>jsPromise.then(function(response) {  // ...}, function(xhrObj) {  // ...})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thankfully this is usually what you want, or at least gives you access to what you want. Also, be aware that jQuery doesn't follow the convention of passing Error objects into rejections.</p>\n<h2>Complex async code made easier <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#complex-async-code-made-easier\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Right, let's code some things. Say we want to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start a spinner to indicate loading</li>\n<li>Fetch some JSON for a story, which gives us the title, and urls for each chapter</li>\n<li>Add title to the page</li>\n<li>Fetch each chapter</li>\n<li>Add the story to the page</li>\n<li>Stop the spinner</li>\n</ol>\n<p>... but also tell the user if something went wrong along the way. We'll want to stop the spinner at that point too, else it'll keep on spinning, get dizzy, and crash into some other UI.</p>\n<p>Of course, you wouldn't use JavaScript to deliver a story, <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2013/progressive-enhancement-is-faster/\">serving as HTML is faster</a>, but this pattern is pretty common when dealing with APIs: Multiple data fetches, then do something when it's all done.</p>\n<p>To start with, let's deal with fetching data from the network:</p>\n<h2>Promisifying XMLHttpRequest <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#promisifying-xmlhttprequest\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Old APIs will be updated to use promises, if it's possible in a backwards compatible way. <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is a prime candidate, but in the mean time let's write a simple function to make a GET request:</p>\n<pre><code>function get(url) {  // Return a new promise.  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {    // Do the usual XHR stuff    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();    req.open('GET', url);    req.onload = function() {      // This is called even on 404 etc      // so check the status      if (req.status == 200) {        // Resolve the promise with the response text        resolve(req.response);      }      else {        // Otherwise reject with the status text        // which will hopefully be a meaningful error        reject(Error(req.statusText));      }    };    // Handle network errors    req.onerror = function() {      reject(Error(\"Network Error\"));    };    // Make the request    req.send();  });}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let's use it:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);}, function(error) {  console.error(\"Failed!\", error);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can make HTTP requests without manually typing <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, which is great, because the less I have to see the infuriating camel-casing of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, the happier my life will be.</p>\n<h2>Chaining <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#chaining\">#</a></h2>\n<p><code>then()</code> isn't the end of the story, you can chain <code>then</code>s together to transform values or run additional async actions one after another.</p>\n<h3>Transforming values <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#transforming-values\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can transform values simply by returning the new value:</p>\n<pre><code>var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  resolve(1);});promise.then(function(val) {  console.log(val); // 1  return val + 2;}).then(function(val) {  console.log(val); // 3})\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a practical example, let's go back to:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>The response is JSON, but we're currently receiving it as plain text. We could alter our get function to use the JSON <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#responseType\"><code>responseType</code></a>, but we could also solve it in promises land:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  return JSON.parse(response);}).then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Yey JSON!\", response);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since <code>JSON.parse()</code> takes a single argument and returns a transformed value, we can make a shortcut:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(JSON.parse).then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Yey JSON!\", response);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>In fact, we could make a <code>getJSON()</code> function really easily:</p>\n<pre><code>function getJSON(url) {  return get(url).then(JSON.parse);}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>getJSON()</code> still returns a promise, one that fetches a url then parses the response as JSON.</p>\n<h3>Queuing asynchronous actions <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#queuing-asynchronous-actions\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can also chain <code>then</code>s to run async actions in sequence.</p>\n<p>When you return something from a <code>then()</code> callback, it's a bit magic. If you return a value, the next <code>then()</code> is called with that value. However, if you return something promise-like, the next <code>then()</code> waits on it, and is only called when that promise settles (succeeds/fails). For example:</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[0]);}).then(function(chapter1) {  console.log(\"Got chapter 1!\", chapter1);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we make an async request to <code>story.json</code>, which gives us a set of URLs to request, then we request the first of those. This is when promises really start to stand out from simple callback patterns.</p>\n<p>You could even make a shortcut method to get chapters:</p>\n<pre><code>var storyPromise;function getChapter(i) {  storyPromise = storyPromise || getJSON('story.json');  return storyPromise.then(function(story) {    return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[i]);  })}// and using it is simple:getChapter(0).then(function(chapter) {  console.log(chapter);  return getChapter(1);}).then(function(chapter) {  console.log(chapter);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>We don't download <code>story.json</code> until <code>getChapter</code> is called, but the next time(s) <code>getChapter</code> is called we reuse the story promise, so <code>story.json</code> is only fetched once. Yay Promises!</p>\n<h2>Error handling <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#error-handling\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As we saw earlier, <code>then()</code> takes two arguments, one for success, one for failure (or fulfill and reject, in promises-speak):</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);}, function(error) {  console.log(\"Failed!\", error);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also use <code>catch()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);}).catch(function(error) {  console.log(\"Failed!\", error);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>There's nothing special about <code>catch()</code>, it's just sugar for <code>then(undefined, func)</code>, but it's more readable. Note that the two code examples above do not behave the same, the latter is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);}).then(undefined, function(error) {  console.log(\"Failed!\", error);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>The difference is subtle, but extremely useful. Promise rejections skip forward to the next <code>then()</code> with a rejection callback (or <code>catch()</code>, since it's equivalent). With <code>then(func1, func2)</code>, <code>func1</code> or <code>func2</code> will be called, never both. But with <code>then(func1).catch(func2)</code>, both will be called if <code>func1</code> rejects, as they're separate steps in the chain. Take the following:</p>\n<pre><code>asyncThing1().then(function() {  return asyncThing2();}).then(function() {  return asyncThing3();}).catch(function(err) {  return asyncRecovery1();}).then(function() {  return asyncThing4();}, function(err) {  return asyncRecovery2();}).catch(function(err) {  console.log(\"Don't worry about it\");}).then(function() {  console.log(\"All done!\");})\n</code></pre>\n<p>The flow above is very similar to normal JavaScript try/catch, errors that happen within a \"try\" go immediately to the <code>catch()</code> block. Here's the above as a flowchart (because I love flowcharts):</p>\n<p>Follow the blue lines for promises that fulfill, or the red for ones that reject.</p>\n<h3>JavaScript exceptions and promises <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#javascript-exceptions-and-promises\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Rejections happen when a promise is explicitly rejected, but also implicitly if an error is thrown in the constructor callback:</p>\n<pre><code>var jsonPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  // JSON.parse throws an error if you feed it some  // invalid JSON, so this implicitly rejects:  resolve(JSON.parse(\"This ain't JSON\"));});jsonPromise.then(function(data) {  // This never happens:  console.log(\"It worked!\", data);}).catch(function(err) {  // Instead, this happens:  console.log(\"It failed!\", err);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>This means it's useful to do all your promise-related work inside the promise constructor callback, so errors are automatically caught and become rejections.</p>\n<p>The same goes for errors thrown in <code>then()</code> callbacks.</p>\n<pre><code>get('/').then(JSON.parse).then(function() {  // This never happens, '/' is an HTML page, not JSON  // so JSON.parse throws  console.log(\"It worked!\", data);}).catch(function(err) {  // Instead, this happens:  console.log(\"It failed!\", err);})\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Error handling in practice <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#error-handling-in-practice\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With our story and chapters, we can use catch to display an error to the user:</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[0]);}).then(function(chapter1) {  addHtmlToPage(chapter1.html);}).catch(function() {  addTextToPage(\"Failed to show chapter\");}).then(function() {  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>If fetching <code>story.chapterUrls[0]</code> fails (e.g., http 500 or user is offline), it'll skip all following success callbacks, which includes the one in <code>getJSON()</code> which tries to parse the response as JSON, and also skips the callback that adds chapter1.html to the page. Instead it moves onto the catch callback. As a result, \"Failed to show chapter\" will be added to the page if any of the previous actions failed.</p>\n<p>Like JavaScript's try/catch, the error is caught and subsequent code continues, so the spinner is always hidden, which is what we want. The above becomes a non-blocking async version of:</p>\n<pre><code>try {  var story = getJSONSync('story.json');  var chapter1 = getJSONSync(story.chapterUrls[0]);  addHtmlToPage(chapter1.html);}catch (e) {  addTextToPage(\"Failed to show chapter\");}document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none'\n</code></pre>\n<p>You may want to <code>catch()</code> simply for logging purposes, without recovering from the error. To do this, just rethrow the error. We could do this in our <code>getJSON()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code>function getJSON(url) {  return get(url).then(JSON.parse).catch(function(err) {    console.log(\"getJSON failed for\", url, err);    throw err;  });}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we've managed to fetch one chapter, but we want them all. Let's make that happen.</p>\n<h2>Parallelism and sequencing: getting the best of both <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#parallelism-and-sequencing:-getting-the-best-of-both\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Thinking async isn't easy. If you're struggling to get off the mark, try writing the code as if it were synchronous. In this case:</p>\n<pre><code>try {  var story = getJSONSync('story.json');  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);  story.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {    var chapter = getJSONSync(chapterUrl);    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });  addTextToPage(\"All done\");}catch (err) {  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);}document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none'\n</code></pre>\n<p>That works! But it's sync and locks up the browser while things download. To make this work async we use <code>then()</code> to make things happen one after another.</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);  // TODO: for each url in story.chapterUrls, fetch &#x26;amp; display}).then(function() {  // And we're all done!  addTextToPage(\"All done\");}).catch(function(err) {  // Catch any error that happened along the way  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);}).then(function() {  // Always hide the spinner  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>But how can we loop through the chapter urls and fetch them in order? This doesn't work:</p>\n<pre><code>story.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {  // Fetch chapter  getJSON(chapterUrl).then(function(chapter) {    // and add it to the page    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });})\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>forEach</code> isn't async-aware, so our chapters would appear in whatever order they download, which is basically how Pulp Fiction was written. This isn't Pulp Fiction, so let's fix it.</p>\n<h3>Creating a sequence <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#creating-a-sequence\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We want to turn our <code>chapterUrls</code> array into a sequence of promises. We can do that using <code>then()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Start off with a promise that always resolvesvar sequence = Promise.resolve();// Loop through our chapter urlsstory.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {  // Add these actions to the end of the sequence  sequence = sequence.then(function() {    return getJSON(chapterUrl);  }).then(function(chapter) {    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });})\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the first time we've seen <code>Promise.resolve()</code>, which creates a promise that resolves to whatever value you give it. If you pass it an instance of <code>Promise</code> it'll simply return it (note: this is a change to the spec that some implementations don't yet follow). If you pass it something promise-like (has a <code>then()</code> method), it creates a genuine <code>Promise</code> that fulfills/rejects in the same way. If you pass in any other value, e.g., <code>Promise.resolve('Hello')</code>, it creates a promise that fulfills with that value. If you call it with no value, as above, it fulfills with \"undefined\".</p>\n<p>There's also <code>Promise.reject(val)</code>, which creates a promise that rejects with the value you give it (or undefined).</p>\n<p>We can tidy up the above code using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce\"><code>array.reduce</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Loop through our chapter urlsstory.chapterUrls.reduce(function(sequence, chapterUrl) {  // Add these actions to the end of the sequence  return sequence.then(function() {    return getJSON(chapterUrl);  }).then(function(chapter) {    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });}, Promise.resolve())\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is doing the same as the previous example, but doesn't need the separate \"sequence\" variable. Our reduce callback is called for each item in the array. \"sequence\" is <code>Promise.resolve()</code> the first time around, but for the rest of the calls \"sequence\" is whatever we returned from the previous call. <code>array.reduce</code> is really useful for boiling an array down to a single value, which in this case is a promise.</p>\n<p>Let's put it all together:</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);  return story.chapterUrls.reduce(function(sequence, chapterUrl) {    // Once the last chapter's promise is done...    return sequence.then(function() {      // ...fetch the next chapter      return getJSON(chapterUrl);    }).then(function(chapter) {      // and add it to the page      addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);    });  }, Promise.resolve());}).then(function() {  // And we're all done!  addTextToPage(\"All done\");}).catch(function(err) {  // Catch any error that happened along the way  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);}).then(function() {  // Always hide the spinner  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>And there we have it, a fully async version of the sync version. But we can do better. At the moment our page is downloading like this:</p>\n<p>Browsers are pretty good at downloading multiple things at once, so we're losing performance by downloading chapters one after the other. What we want to do is download them all at the same time, then process them when they've all arrived. Thankfully there's an API for this:</p>\n<pre><code>Promise.all(arrayOfPromises).then(function(arrayOfResults) {  //...})\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Promise.all</code> takes an array of promises and creates a promise that fulfills when all of them successfully complete. You get an array of results (whatever the promises fulfilled to) in the same order as the promises you passed in.</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);  // Take an array of promises and wait on them all  return Promise.all(    // Map our array of chapter urls to    // an array of chapter json promises    story.chapterUrls.map(getJSON)  );}).then(function(chapters) {  // Now we have the chapters jsons in order! Loop through...  chapters.forEach(function(chapter) {    // ...and add to the page    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });  addTextToPage(\"All done\");}).catch(function(err) {  // catch any error that happened so far  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);}).then(function() {  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Depending on connection, this can be seconds faster than loading one-by-one, and it's less code than our first try. The chapters can download in whatever order, but they appear on screen in the right order.</p>\n<p>However, we can still improve perceived performance. When chapter one arrives we should add it to the page. This lets the user start reading before the rest of the chapters have arrived.

Digital databases have been around since the 1960s. Relational databases, those which store \"related\" data, are the oldest and most common type of database in use today.</p>\n<h3><strong>Data Persistence</strong></h3>\n<p>A database is often necessary because our application or code requires data persistence. This term refers to data that is infrequently accessed and not likely to be modified. In less technical terms, the information will be safely stored and remain untouched unless intentionally modified.</p>\n<p>A familiar example of non-persistent data would be JavaScript objects and arrays, which reset each time the code runs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Relational Databases</strong></h3>\n<p>In relational databases, <strong>the data is stored in tabular format grouped into rows and columns</strong> (similar to spreadsheets). A collection of rows is called a table. Each row represents a single record in the table and is made up of one or more columns.</p>\n<p>These kinds of databases are relational because a <em>relation</em> is a mathematical idea equivalent to a table. So relational databases are databases that store their data in tables.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tables</strong></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2e309a41-e107-46f3-81e7-154d732d3dcf/Untitled.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Below are some basic facts about tables:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tables organize data in rows and columns.</li>\n<li>Each row in a table represents one distinct record.</li>\n<li>Each column represents a field or attribute that is common to all the records.</li>\n<li>Fields should have a descriptive name and a data type appropriate for the attribute it represents.</li>\n<li>Tables usually have more rows than columns.</li>\n<li>Tables have primary keys that uniquely identify each row.</li>\n<li>Foreign keys represent the relationships with other tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<h3>SQL:</h3>\n<p>SQL is a standard language, which means that it almost certainly will be supported, no matter how your database is managed. That said, be aware that the SQL language can vary depending on database management tools. This lesson focuses on a set of core commands that never change. Learning the standard commands is an excellent introduction since the knowledge transfers between database products.</p>\n<p>The syntax for SQL is English-like and requires fewer symbols than programming languages like C, Java, and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>It is declarative and concise, which means there is a lot less to learn to use it effectively.</p>\n<p>When learning SQL, it is helpful to understand that each command is designed for a different purpose. If we classify the commands by purpose, we'll end up with the following sub-categories of SQL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong>: used to modify database objects. Some examples are: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong>: used to manipulate the data stored in the database. Some examples are: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Query Language (DQL)</strong>: used to ask questions about the data stored in the database. The most commonly used SQL command is SELECT, and it falls in this category.</li>\n<li><strong>Data Control Language (DCL)</strong>: used to manage database security and user's access to data. These commands fall into the realm of Database Administrators. Some examples are GRANT and REVOKE.</li>\n<li><strong>Transaction Control Commands</strong>: used for managing groups of statements that must execute as a unit or not execute at all. Examples are COMMIT and ROLLBACK.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a developer, you'll need to get familiar with DDL and become proficient using DML and DQL. This lesson will cover only DML and DQL commands.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>The four SQL operations covered in this section will allow a user to <strong>query</strong>, <strong>insert</strong>, and <strong>modify</strong> a database table.</p>\n<h3><strong>Query</strong></h3>\n<p>A <strong>query</strong> is a SQL statement used to retrieve data from a database. The command used to write queries is SELECT, and it is one of the most commonly used SQL commands.</p>\n<p>The basic syntax for a SELECT statement is this:</p>\n<p>To see all the fields on a table, we can use a * as the selection.</p>\n<p>The preceding statement would show all the records and all the columns for each record in the employees table.</p>\n<p>To pick the fields we want to see, we use a comma-separated list:</p>\n<p>The return of that statement would hold all records from the listed fields.</p>\n<p>We can extend the SELECT command's capabilities using clauses for things like filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.</p>\n<p>It is possible to query multiple tables in a single query. But, in this section, we only perform queries on a single table. We will cover performing queries on multiple tables in another section.</p>\n<h3><strong>Insert</strong></h3>\n<p>To <strong>insert</strong> new data into a table, we'll use the INSERT command. The basic syntax for an INSERT statement is this:</p>\n<p>Using this formula, we can specify which values will be inserted into which fields like so:</p>\n<h3><strong>Modify</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Modifying</strong> a database consists of updating and removing records. For these operations, we'll use UPDATE and DELETE commands, respectively.</p>\n<p>The basic syntax for an UPDATE statement is:</p>\n<p>The basic syntax for a DELETE statement is:</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Filtering results using WHERE clause</strong></h3>\n<p>When querying a database, the default result will be every entry in the given table. However, often, we are looking for a specific record or a set of records that meets certain criteria.</p>\n<p>A WHERE clause can help in both cases.</p>\n<p>Here's an example where we might only want to find customers living in Berlin.</p>\n<p>We can also chain together WHERE clauses using OR and AND to limit our results further.</p>\n<p>The following query includes only records that match both criteria.</p>\n<p>And this query includes records that match either criteria.</p>\n<p>These operators can be combined and grouped with parentheses to add complex selection logic. They behave similarly to what you're used to in programming languages.</p>\n<p>You can read more about SQLite operators from <a href=\"https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite/operators.php\">w3resource (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<p>To select a single record, we can use a WHERE statement with a uniquely identifying field, like an id:</p>\n<p>Other comparison operators also work in WHERE conditions, such as >, &#x3C;, &#x3C;=, and >=.</p>\n<h3><strong>Ordering results using the ORDER BY clause</strong></h3>\n<p>Query results are shown in the same order the data was inserted. To control how the data is sorted, we can use the ORDER BY clause. Let's see an example.</p>\n<p>We can pass a list of field names to order by and optionally choose asc or desc for the sort direction. The default is asc, so it doesn't need to be specified.</p>\n<p>Some SQL engines also support using field abbreviations when sorting.</p>\n<p>In this case, the results are sorted by the department in ascending order first and then by salary in descending order. The numbers refer to the fields' position in the <em>selection</em> portion of the query, so 1 would be <em>name</em>, 2 would be <em>salary</em>, and so on.</p>\n<p>Note that the WHERE clause should come after the FROM clause. The ORDER BY clause always goes last.</p>\n<h3><strong>Limiting results using the LIMIT clause</strong></h3>\n<p>When we wish to see only a limited number of records, we can use a LIMIT clause.</p>\n<p>The following returns the first ten records in the products table:</p>\n<p>LIMIT clauses are often used in conjunction with ORDER BY. The following shows us the five cheapest products:</p>\n<h3><strong>Inserting data using INSERT</strong></h3>\n<p>An insert statement adds a new record to the database. All non-null fields must be listed out in the same order as their values. Some fields, like ids and timestamps, may be auto-generated and do not need to be included in an INSERT statement.</p>\n<p>The values in an insert statement must not violate any restrictions and constraints that the database has in place, such as expected datatypes. We will learn more about constraints and schema design in a later section.</p>\n<h3><strong>Modifying recording using UPDATE</strong></h3>\n<p>When modifying a record, we identify a single record or a set of records to update using a WHERE clause. Then we can set the new value(s) in place.</p>\n<p>Technically the WHERE clause is not required, but leaving it off would result in every record within the table receiving the update.</p>\n<h3><strong>Removing records using DELETE</strong></h3>\n<p>When removing a record or set of records, we need only identify which record(s) to remove using a WHERE clause:</p>\n<p>Once again, the WHERE clause is not required, but leaving it off would remove every record in the table, so it's essential.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>Raw SQL is a critical baseline skill. However, Node developers generally use an <strong>Object Relational Mapper (ORM)</strong> or <strong>query builder</strong> to write database commands in a backend codebase. Both <strong>ORMs</strong> and <strong>query builders</strong> are JavaScript libraries that allow us to interface with the database using a JavaScript version of the SQL language.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of a raw SQL SELECT:</p>\n<p>We could use a query builder to write the same logic in JavaScript:</p>\n<p><strong>Query builders</strong> are lightweight and easy to get off the ground, whereas <strong>ORMs</strong> use an object-oriented model and provide more heavy lifting within their rigid structure.</p>\n<p>We will use a <strong>query builder</strong> called <a href=\"https://knexjs.org/\">knex.js (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Knex Setup</strong></h3>\n<p>To use Knex in a repository, we'll need to add two libraries:</p>\n<p>knex is our query builder library, and sqlite3 allows us to interface with a sqlite database. We'll learn more about sqlite and other <strong>database management systems</strong> in the following module. For now, know that you need both libraries.</p>\n<p>Next, we use Knex to set up a config file:</p>\n<p>To use the query builder elsewhere in our code, we need to call knex and pass in a config object. We'll be discussing Knex configuration more in a future module. Still, we only need the client, connection, and useNullAsDefault keys as shown above. The filename should point towards the pre-existing database file, which can be recognized by the .db3 extension.</p>\n<p><strong>GOTCHA</strong>: The file path to the database should be with respect to the <strong>root</strong> of the repo, not the configuration file itself.</p>\n<p>Once Knex is configured, we can import the above config file anywhere in our codebase to access the database.</p>\n<p>The db object provides methods that allow us to begin building queries.</p>\n<h3><strong>SELECT using Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>In Knex, the equivalent of SELECT * FROM users is:</p>\n<p>There's a simpler way to write the same command:</p>\n<p>Using this, we could write a GET endpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: All Knex queries return promises.</p>\n<p>Knex also allows for a where clause. In Knex, we could write SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1 as</p>\n<p>This method will resolve to an array containing a single entry like so: [{ id: 1, name: 'bill' }].</p>\n<p>Using this, we might add a GET endpoint where a specific user:</p>\n<h3><strong>INSERT using Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>In Knex, the equivalent of INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Eva', 32) is:</p>\n<p>The insert method in Knex will resolve to an array containing the newly created id for that user like so: [3].</p>\n<h3><strong>UPDATE using Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>In knex, the equivalent of UPDATE users SET name='Ava', age=33 WHERE id=3; is:</p>\n<p>Note that the where method comes before update, unlike in SQL.</p>\n<p>Update will resolve to a count of rows updated.</p>\n<h3><strong>DELETE using Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>In Knex, the equivalent of DELETE FROM users WHERE age=33; is:</p>\n<p>Once again, the where must come before the del. This method will resolve to a count of records removed.</p>\n<h1>Day #2:</h1>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>SQLlite Studio is an application that allows us to create, open, view, and modify SQLite databases. To fully understand what SQLite Studio is and how it works, we must also understand the concept of the Database Management Systems (DBMS).</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>What is a DBMS?</strong></h3>\n<p>To manage digital databases we use specialized software called <strong>D</strong>ata<strong>B</strong>ase <strong>M</strong>anagement <strong>S</strong>ystems (DBMS). These systems typically run on servers and are managed by <strong>D</strong>ata<strong>B</strong>ase <strong>A</strong>dministrators (DBAs).</p>\n<p>In less technical terms, we need a type of software that will allow us to create, access, and generally manage our databases. In the world of relational databases, we specifically use Relational Database Mangement Systems (RDBMs). Some examples are Postgres, SQLite, MySQL, and Oracle.</p>\n<p>Choosing a DBMS determines everything from how you set up your database, to where and how the data is stored, to what SQL commands you can use. Most systems share the core of the SQL language that you've already learned.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can expect SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, WHERE , and the like to be the same across all DBMSs, but the subtleties of the language may vary.</p>\n<h3><strong>What is SQLite?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>SQLite</strong> is the DBMS, as the name suggests, it is a more lightweight system and thus easier to get set up than some others.</p>\n<p>SQLite allows us to store databases as single files. SQLite projects have a .db3 extension. That is the database.</p>\n<p>SQLite is <em>not a database</em> (like relational, graph, or document are databases) but rather <em>a database management system</em>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Opening an existing database in SQLite Studio</strong></h3>\n<p>One useful visual interface we might use with a SQLite database is called <strong>SQLite Studio</strong>. <a href=\"https://sqlitestudio.pl/\">Install SQLITE Studio here. (Links to an external site.)</a></p>\n<p>Once installed, we can use SQLite Studio to open any .db3 file from a previous lesson. We may view the tables, view the data, and even make changes to the database.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed look at SQLite Studio, follow along in the video above.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>A <strong>database schema</strong> is the shape of our database. It defines what tables we'll have, which columns should exist within the tables and any restrictions on each column.</p>\n<p>A well-designed database schema keeps the data well organized and can help ensure high-quality data.</p>\n<p>Note that while schema design is usually left to Database Administrators (DBAs), understanding schema helps when designing APIs and database logic. And in a smaller team, this step may fall on the developer.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<p>For a look at schema design in SQLite Studio, follow along in the video above.</p>\n<p>When designing a single table, we need to ask three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What fields (or columns) are present?</li>\n<li>What type of data do we expect for each field?</li>\n<li>Are there other restrictions needed for each column?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the following schema diagram for an accounts table, we can the answer to each other those questions:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/9790405dda624818822293a383eec2d2\">Untitled</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Table Fields</strong></h3>\n<p>Choosing which fields to include in a table is relatively straight forward. What information needs to be tracked regarding this resource? In the real world, this is determined by the intended use of the product or app.</p>\n<p>However, this is one requirement every table should satisfy: a <strong>primary key</strong>. A primary key is a way to identify each entry in the database uniquely. It is most often represented as a auto-incrementing integer called id or [tablename]Id.</p>\n<h3><strong>Datatypes</strong></h3>\n<p>Each field must also have a specified datatype. The datatype available depends on our DBMS. Some supported datatype in SQLite include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Null:</strong> Missing or unknown information.</li>\n<li><strong>Integer:</strong> Whole numbers.</li>\n<li><strong>Real:</strong> Any number, including decimals.</li>\n<li><strong>Text:</strong> Character data.</li>\n<li><strong>Blob:</strong> a large binary object that can be used to store miscellaneous data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any data inserted into the table must match the datatypes determined in schema design.</p>\n<h3><strong>Constraints</strong></h3>\n<p>Beyond datatypes, we may add additional <strong>constraints</strong> on each field. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Not Null:</strong> The field cannot be left empty</li>\n<li><strong>Unique:</strong> No two records can have the same value in this field</li>\n<li><strong>Primary key:</strong> - Indicates this field is the primary key. Both the not null and unique constraints will be enforced.</li>\n<li><strong>Default:</strong> - Sets a default value if none is provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with data types, any data that does not satisfy the schema constraints will be rejected from the database.</p>\n<h3><strong>Multi-Table Design</strong></h3>\n<p>Another critical component of schema design is to understand how different tables relate to each other. This will be covered in later lesson.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>Knex provides a <strong>schema builder</strong>, which allows us to write code to design our database schema. However, beyond thinking about columns and constraints, we must also consider updates.</p>\n<p>When a schema needs to be updated, a developer must feel confident that the changes go into effect everywhere. This means schema updates on the developer's local machine, on any testing or staging versions, on the production database, and then on any other developer's local machines. This is where <strong>migrations</strong> come into play.</p>\n<p>A database migration describes changes made to the structure of a database. Migrations include things like adding new objects, adding new tables, and modifying existing objects or tables.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Knex Cli</strong></h3>\n<p>To use migrations (and to make Knex setup easier), we need to use <strong>knex cli</strong>. Install knex globally with npm install -g knex.</p>\n<p>This allows you to use Knex commands within any repo that has knex as a local dependency. If you have any issues with this global install, you can use the npx knex command instead.</p>\n<h3><strong>Initializing Knex</strong></h3>\n<p>To start, add the knex and sqlite3 libraries to your repository.</p>\n<p>npm install knex sqlite3</p>\n<p>We've seen how to use manually create a config object to get started with Knex, but the best practice is to use the following command:</p>\n<p>Or, if Knex isn't globally installed:</p>\n<p>This command will generate a file in your root folder called knexfile.js. It will be auto populated with three config objects, based on different environments. We can delete all except for the development object.</p>\n<p>We'll need to update the location (or desired location) of the database as well as add the useNullAsDefault option. The latter option prevents crashes when working with sqlite3.</p>\n<p>Now, wherever we configure our database, we may use the following syntax instead of hardcoding in a config object.</p>\n<h3><strong>Knex Migrations</strong></h3>\n<p>Once our knexfile is set up, we can begin creating <strong>migrations</strong>. Though it's not required, we are going to add an addition option to the config object to specify a directory for the migration files.</p>\n<p>We can generate a new migration with the following command:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:make [migration-name]</p>\n<p>If we needed to create an accounts table, we might run:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:make create-accounts</p>\n<p>Note that inside data/migrations/ a new file has appeared. Migrations have a timestamp in their filenames automatically. Wither you like this or not, <strong>do not edit migration names.</strong></p>\n<p>The migration file should have both an up and a down function. Within the up function, we write the ended database changes. Within the down function, we write the code to undo the up functions. This allows us to undo any changes made to the schema if necessary.</p>\n<p>References for these methods are found in the <strong>schema builder</strong> section of the <a href=\"https://knexjs.org/\">Knex docs (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, the table is <strong>not</strong> yet created. To run this (and any other) migrations, use the command:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:latest</p>\n<p>Note if the database does not exist, this command will auto-generate one. We can use SQLite Studio to confirm that the accounts table has been created.</p>\n<h3><strong>Changes and Rollbacks</strong></h3>\n<p>If later down the road, we realize you need to update your schema, you shouldn't edit the migration file. Instead, you will want to create a new migration with the command:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:make accounts-schema-update</p>\n<p>Once we've written our updates into this file we save and close with:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:latest</p>\n<p>If we migrate our database and then quickly realize something isn't right, we can edit the migration file. However, first, we need to <strong>rolllback</strong> (or undo) our last migration with:</p>\n<p>knex migrate:rollback</p>\n<p>Finally, we are free to rerun that file with knex migrate latest.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: A rollback should not be used to edit an old migration file once that file has accepted into a main branch.

Like <strong>primary keys</strong>, they are most often integers that identify (rather than store) data. However, whereas a primary key is used to id rows in a table, foreign keys are used to connect a record in one table to a record in a second table.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<p>Consider the following farms and ranchers tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/5b20c5e233dd4a70a33d6ab2c2e1c8bb\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/0b0a909c24a9474fb9df80938546f12a\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>The farm<em>id in the ranchers table is an example of a foreign key. Each entry in the farm</em>id (foreign key) column corresponds to an id (primary key) in the farms table. This allows us to track which farm each rancher belongs to while keeping the tables normalized.</p>\n<p>If we could only see the ranchers table, we would know that John, Jane, and Jen all work together and that Jim and Jay also work together. However, to know where any of them work, we would need to look at the farms table.</p>\n<p>Now that we understand the basics of querying data from a single table, let's move on to selecting data from multiple tables using JOIN operations.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>We can use a JOIN to combine query data from multiple tables using a single SELECT statement.</p>\n<p>There are different types of joins; some are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inner joins.</li>\n<li>outer joins.</li>\n<li>left joins.</li>\n<li>right joins.</li>\n<li>cross joins.</li>\n<li>non-equality joins.</li>\n<li>self joins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using joins requires that the two tables of interest contain at least one field with shared information. For example, if a <em>departments</em> table has an <em>id</em> field, and an employee table has a <em>department_id</em> field, and the values that exist in the <em>id</em> column of the <em>departments</em> table live in the <em>department_id</em> field of the employee table, we can use those fields to join both tables like so:</p>\n<p>This query will return the data from both tables for every instance where the ON condition is true. If there are employees with no value for department<em>id or where the value stored in the field does not correspond to an existing id in the</em> departments <em>table, then that record will NOT be returned. In a similar fashion, any records from the</em> departments <em>table that don't have an employee associated with them will also be omitted from the results. Basically, if the</em> id* does not show as the value of department_id for an employee, it won't be able to join.</p>\n<p>We can shorten the condition by giving the table names an alias. This is a common practice. Below is the same example using aliases, picking which fields to return and sorting the results:</p>\n<p>Notice that we can take advantage of white space and indentation to make queries more readable.</p>\n<p>There are several ways of writing joins, but the one shown here should work on all database management systems and avoid some pitfalls, so we recommend it.</p>\n<p>The syntax for performing a similar join using Knex is as follows:</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<p>A good explanation of how the different types of joins can be seen <a href=\"https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/sql-joins.php\">in this article from w3resource.com (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<h1>What is SQL Joins?</h1>\n<p>An SQL JOIN clause combines rows from two or more tables.

Non-normalized tables are considered ineffective in relational databases.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Data normalization</strong> is a deep topic in database design. To begin thinking about it, we'll explore a few basic guidelines and some data examples that violate these rules.</p>\n<h3><strong>Normalization Guidelines</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Each record has a primary key.</li>\n<li>No fields are repeated.</li>\n<li>All fields relate directly to the key data.</li>\n<li>Each field entry contains a single data point.</li>\n<li>There are no redundant entries.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Denormalized Data</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/19a01f68a659470fb85bbe6906fb4bad\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>This table has two issues. There is no proper id field (as multiple farms may have the same name), and multiple fields are representing the same type of data: animals.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/075ad6dd99ac48698625d7b56ca67bef\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>While we have now eliminated the first two issues, we now have multiple entries in one field, separated by commas. This isn't good either, as its another example of denormalization. There is no \"array\" data type in a relational database, so each field must contain only one data point.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/375a15b0cb3f444a8698cd6cb3a08fe0\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>Now we've solved the multiple fields issue, but we created repeating data (the farm field), which is also an example of denormalization. As well, we can see that if we were tracking additional ranch information (such as annual revenue), that field is only vaguely related to the animal information.</p>\n<p><strong>When these issues begin arising in your schema design, it means that you should separate information into two or more tables.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Anomalies</strong></h3>\n<p>Obeying the above guidelines prevent <strong>anomalies</strong> in your database when inserting, updating, or deleting. For example, imagine if the revenue of Beech Ranch changed. With our denormalized schema, it may get updated in some records but not others:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/e05f5b2e8ff141798adc6f188f56f31e\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>Similarly, if Beech Ranch shut down, there would be three (if not more) records that needed to be deleted to remove a single farm.</p>\n<p>Thus a denormalized table opens the door for contradictory, confusing, and unusable data.</p>\n<h2><strong>Challenge</strong></h2>\n<p>What issues does the following table have?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/2793e8f6b70a47f48f9208779366e69e\">Untitled</a></p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>There are three types of relationships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One to one.</li>\n<li>One to many.</li>\n<li>Many to many.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Determining how data is related can provide a set of guidelines for table representation and guides the use of foreign keys to connect said tables.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>One to One Relationships</strong></h3>\n<p>Imagine we are storing the financial projections for a series of farms.</p>\n<p>We may wish to attach fields like farm name, address, description, projected revenue, and projected expenses. We could divide these fields into two categories: information related to the farm directly (name, address, description) and information related to the financial projections (revenue, expenses).</p>\n<p>We would say that farms and projections have a <strong>one-to-one</strong> relationship. This is to say that every farm has exactly one projection, and every project corresponds to exactly one farm.</p>\n<p>This data can be represented in two tables: farms and projections</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/944e594f3464473ea06383bfdea13265\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/de32fcf6760e45f284707274433fee92\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>The farm_id is the foreign key that links farms and projections together.</p>\n<p>Notes about one-to-one relationships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The foreign key should always have a unique constraint to prevent duplicate entries. In the example above, we wouldn't want to allow multiple projections records for one farm.</li>\n<li>The foreign key can be in either table. For example, we may have had a projection_id in the farms table instead. A good rule of thumb is to put the foreign key in whichever table is more auxiliary to the other.</li>\n<li>You can represent one-to-one data in a single table <em>without</em> creating anomalies. However, it is sometimes prudent to use two tables as shown above to keep separate concerns in separate tables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>One to Many Relationships</strong></h3>\n<p>Now imagine, we are storing the full-time ranchers employed at each farm. In this case, each rancher would only work at one farm however, each farm may have multiple ranchers.</p>\n<p>This is called a <strong>one-to-many</strong> relationship.</p>\n<p>This is the most common type of relationship between entities. Some other examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One customer can have many orders.</li>\n<li>One user can have many posts.</li>\n<li>One post can have many comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Manage this type of relationship by adding a foreign key on the \"many\" table of the relationship that points to the primary key on the \"one\" table. Consider the farms and ranchers tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/7dfd2e69c9804a01845f2e9b716a5ac2\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/c95f3d418db94ab4b4532eeba0e4f918\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>In a many-to-many relationship, the foreign key (in this case farm_id) should <em>not</em> be unique.</p>\n<h3><strong>Many to Many Relationships</strong></h3>\n<p>If we want to track animals on a farm as well, we must explore the <strong>many-to-many</strong> relationship. A farm has multiple animals, and multiple of each type of animal is present at multiple different farms.</p>\n<p>Some other examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an order can have many products and the same product will appear in many orders.</li>\n<li>a book can have more than one author, and an author can write more than one book.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To model this relationship, we need to introduce an <strong>intermediary table</strong> that holds foreign keys that reference the primary key on the related tables. We now have a farms, animals, and farm_animals table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/3269812d7c2a4578b1a9f6bc27e485b1\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/c2642c7f632f489cb1b9639c80b8400d\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/d0b0042c5e104edd9ed55e122af89084\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>While each foreign key on the intermediary table is not unique, the combinations of keys should be unique.</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>\n<p>The Knex query builder library also allows us to create multi-table schemas include foreign keys. However, there are a few extra things to keep in mind when designing a multi-table schema, such as using the correct order when creating tables, dropping tables, seeding data, and removing data.</p>\n<p>We have to consider the way that delete and updates through our API will impact related data.</p>\n<h2><strong>Follow Along</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Foreign Key Setup</strong></h3>\n<p>In Knex, foreign key restrictions don't automatically work. Whenever using foreign keys in your schema, add the following code to your knexfile. This will prevent users from entering bad data into a foreign key column.</p>\n<h3><strong>Migrations</strong></h3>\n<p>Let's look at how we might track our farms and ranchers using Knex. In our migration file's up function, we would want to create two tables:</p>\n<p>Note that the foreign key can only be created <em>after</em> the reference table.</p>\n<p>In the down function, the opposite is true. We always want to drop a table with a foreign key <em>before</em> dropping the table it references.</p>\n<p>In the case of a many-to-many relationship, the syntax for creating an intermediary table is identical, except for one additional piece. We need a way to make sure our combination of foreign keys is unique.</p>\n<h3><strong>Seeds</strong></h3>\n<p>Order is also a concern when seeding. We want to create seeds in the <strong>same</strong> order we created our tables. In other words, don't create a seed with a foreign key, until that reference record exists.</p>\n<p>In our example, make sure to write the 01-farms seed file and then the 02-ranchers seed file.</p>\n<p>However, we run into a problem with truncating our seeds, because we want to truncate 02-ranchers <em>before</em> 01-farms. A library called knex-cleaner provides an easy solution for us.</p>\n<p>Run knex seed:make 00-cleanup and npm install knex-cleaner.

Modern operating systems like Linux and macOS both include built-in Unix command line terminals. This makes Linux and macOS complementary operating systems when working with Git. Microsoft Windows instead uses Windows command prompt, a non-Unix terminal environment.</p>\n<p>In Windows environments, Git is often packaged as part of higher level GUI applications. GUIs for Git may attempt to abstract and hide the underlying version control system primitives. This can be a great aid for Git beginners to rapidly contribute to a project. Once a project's collaboration requirements grow with other team members, it is critical to be aware of how the actual raw Git methods work. This is when it can be beneficial to drop a GUI version for the command line tools. Git Bash is offered to provide a terminal Git experience.</p>\n<h2>What is Git Bash?</h2>\n<p>Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience. Bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell. A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system through written commands. Bash is a popular default shell on Linux and macOS. Git Bash is a package that installs Bash, some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system.</p>\n<h2>How to install Git Bash</h2>\n<p>Git Bash comes included as part of the <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\">Git For Windows</a> package. Download and install Git For Windows like other Windows applications. Once downloaded find the included <code>.exe</code> file and open to execute Git Bash.</p>\n<h2>How to use Git Bash</h2>\n<p>Git Bash has the same operations as a standard Bash experience. It will be helpful to review basic Bash usage. Advanced usage of Bash is outside the scope of this Git focused document.</p>\n<h2>How to navigate folders</h2>\n<p>The Bash command <code>pwd</code> is used to print the 'present working directory'. <code>pwd</code> is equivalent to executing cd on a DOS(Windows console host) terminal. This is the folder or path that the current Bash session resides in.</p>\n<p>The Bash command <code>ls</code> is used to 'list' contents of the current working directory. <code>ls</code> is equivalent to <code>DIR</code> on a Windows console host terminal.</p>\n<p>Both Bash and Windows console host have a cd command. cd is an acronym for 'Change Directory'. cd is invoked with an appended directory name. Executing cd will change the terminal sessions current working directory to the passed directory argument.</p>\n<h2>Git Bash Commands</h2>\n<p>Git Bash is packaged with additional commands that can be found in the <code>/usr/bin</code> directory of the Git Bash emulation.

You can use it with any static site generator to create faster, more flexible web projects. Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.</p>\n<p>At its core, Netlify CMS is an open-source React app that acts as a wrapper for the Git workflow, using the GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket API. This provides many advantages, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fast, web-based UI:</strong> With rich-text editing, real-time preview, and drag-and-drop media uploads.</li>\n<li><strong>Platform agnostic:</strong> Works with most static site generators.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy installation:</strong> Add two files to your site and hook up the backend by including those files in your build process or linking to our Content Delivery Network (CDN).</li>\n<li><strong>Modern authentication:</strong> Using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and JSON web tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible content types:</strong> Specify an unlimited number of content types with custom fields.</li>\n<li><strong>Fully extensible:</strong> Create custom-styled previews, UI widgets, and editor plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Netlify CMS vs. Netlify</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify.com</a> is a platform you can use to automatically build, deploy, serve, and manage your frontend sites and web apps. It also provides a variety of other features like form processing, serverless functions, and split testing. Not all Netlify sites use Netlify CMS, and not all sites using Netlify CMS are on Netlify.</p>\n<p>The folks at Netlify created Netlify CMS to fill a gap in the static site generation pipeline. There were some great proprietary headless CMS options, but no real contenders that were open source and extensible—that could turn into a community-built ecosystem like WordPress or Drupal. For that reason, Netlify CMS is <em>made</em> to be community-driven, and has never been locked to the Netlify platform (despite the name).</p>\n<p>With this in mind, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use Netlify CMS without Netlify and deploy your site where you always have, hooking up your own CI, site hosting, CDN, etc.</li>\n<li>Use Netlify without Netlify CMS and edit your static site in your code editor.</li>\n<li>Or, use them together and have a fully-working CMS-enabled site with <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/\">one click</a>!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you hook up Netlify CMS to your website, you're basically adding a tool for content editors to make commits to your site repository without touching code or learning Git.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add to Your Site<strong>These generatorsstore static files in</strong>Jekyll, GitBook/ (project root)Hugo, Gatsby, Nuxt, Gridsome, Zola, Sapper/staticNext/publicHexo, Middleman, Jigsaw/sourceSpike/viewsWyam/inputPelican/contentVuePress/.vuepress/publicElmstatic/_site11ty/_sitepreact-cli/src/staticnamePost type identifier, used in routes.

Each field contains the following properties:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can adapt Netlify CMS to a wide variety of projects. It works with any content written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/\">GitLab</a>, or <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\">Bitbucket</a>. You can also create your own custom backend.</p>\n<p>This tutorial guides you through the steps for adding Netlify CMS to a site that's built with a common <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\">static site generator</a>, like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, you can <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template\">start from a template</a> or dive right into <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options\">configuration options</a>.</p>\n<h2>App File Structure</h2>\n<p>A static admin folder contains all Netlify CMS files, stored at the root of your published site. Where you store this folder in the source files depends on your static site generator. Here's the static file location for a few of the most popular static site generators:</p>\n<p>If your generator isn't listed here, you can check its documentation, or as a shortcut, look in your project for a css or images folder. The contents of folders like that are usually processed as static files, so it's likely you can store your admin folder next to those. (When you've found the location, feel free to add it to these docs by <a href=\"https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests\">filing a pull request</a>!)</p>\n<p>Inside the admin folder, you'll create two files:</p>\n<p>The first file, admin/index.html, is the entry point for the Netlify CMS admin interface. This means that users navigate to yoursite.com/admin/ to access it. On the code side, it's a basic HTML starter page that loads the Netlify CMS JavaScript file. The second file, admin/config.yml, is the heart of your Netlify CMS installation, and a bit more complex. The <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#configuration\">Configuration</a> section covers the details.</p>\n<p>In this example, we pull the admin/index.html file from a public CDN.</p>\n<p>In the code above the script is loaded from the unpkg CDN. Should there be any issue, jsDelivr can be used as an alternative source. Simply set the src to <a href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/netlify-cms@%5E2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js\">https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js</a></p>\n<h3>Installing with npm</h3>\n<p>You can also use Netlify CMS as an npm module. Wherever you import Netlify CMS, it automatically runs, taking over the current page. Make sure the script that imports it only runs on your CMS page. First install the package and save it to your project:</p>\n<p>Then import it (assuming your project has tooling for imports):</p>\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Configuration is different for every site, so we'll break it down into parts. Add all the code snippets in this section to your admin/config.yml file.</p>\n<h3>Backend</h3>\n<p>We're using <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> for our hosting and authentication in this tutorial, so backend configuration is fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p>For GitHub and GitLab repositories, you can start your Netlify CMS config.yml file with these lines:</p>\n<p><em>(For Bitbucket repositories, use the _[</em>Bitbucket backend<em>](<a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/bitbucket-backend\">https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/bitbucket-backend</a>)</em> instructions instead.)_</p>\n<p>The configuration above specifies your backend protocol and your publication branch. Git Gateway is an open source API that acts as a proxy between authenticated users of your site and your site repo. (We'll get to the details of that in the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication\">Authentication section</a> below.) If you leave out the branch declaration, it defaults to master.</p>\n<h3>Editorial Workflow</h3>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Editorial workflow works with GitHub repositories, and support for GitLab and Bitbucket is <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/beta-features/#gitlab-and-bitbucket-editorial-workflow-support\">in beta</a>.</p>\n<p>By default, saving a post in the CMS interface pushes a commit directly to the publication branch specified in backend. However, you also have the option to enable the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/#publish-mode\">Editorial Workflow</a>, which adds an interface for drafting, reviewing, and approving posts. To do this, add the following line to your Netlify CMS config.yml:</p>\n<h3>Media and Public Folders</h3>\n<p>Netlify CMS allows users to upload images directly within the editor. For this to work, the CMS needs to know where to save them. If you already have an images folder in your project, you could use its path, possibly creating an uploads sub-folder, for example:</p>\n<p>If you're creating a new folder for uploaded media, you'll need to know where your static site generator expects static files. You can refer to the paths outlined above in <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#app-file-structure\">App File Structure</a>, and put your media folder in the same location where you put the admin folder.</p>\n<p>Note that themedia_folder file path is relative to the project root, so the example above would work for Jekyll, GitBook, or any other generator that stores static files at the project root. However, it would not work for Hugo, Hexo, Middleman or others that store static files in a subfolder. Here's an example that could work for a Hugo site:</p>\n<p>The configuration above adds a new setting, public<em>folder. While media</em>folder specifies where uploaded files are saved in the repo, public_folder indicates where they are found in the published site. Image src attributes use this path, which is relative to the file where it's called. For this reason, we usually start the path at the site root, using the opening /.</p>\n<p><em>If public</em>folder is not set, Netlify CMS defaults to the same value as media<em>folder, adding an opening / if one is not included.</em></p>\n<h3>Collections</h3>\n<p>Collections define the structure for the different content types on your static site. Since every site is different, the collections settings differ greatly from one site to the next.</p>\n<p>Let's say your site has a blog, with the posts stored in _posts/blog, and files saved in a date-title format, like 1999-12-31-lets-party.md. Each post begins with settings in yaml-formatted front matter, like so:</p>\n<p>Given this example, our collections settings would look like this in your NetlifyCMS config.yml file:</p>\n<p>Let's break that down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>label: Field label in the editor UI.</li>\n<li>name: Field name in the document front matter.</li>\n<li>widget: Determines UI style and value data type (details below).</li>\n<li>default (optional): Sets a default value for the field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As described above, the widget property specifies a built-in or custom UI widget for a given field. When a content editor enters a value into a widget, that value is saved in the document front matter as the value for the name specified for that field. A full listing of available widgets can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets\">Widgets doc</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on this example, you can go through the post types in your site and add the appropriate settings to your Netlify CMS config.yml file. Each post type should be listed as a separate node under the collections field. See the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/#collections\">Collections reference doc</a> for more configuration options.</p>\n<h3>Filter</h3>\n<p>The entries for any collection can be filtered based on the value of a single field. The example collection below only shows post entries with the value en in the language field.</p>\n<h2>Authentication</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your Netlify CMS files in place and configured, all that's left is to enable authentication. We're using the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> platform here because it's one of the quickest ways to get started, but you can learn about other authentication options in the <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/backends-overview\">Backends</a> doc.</p>\n<h3>Setup on Netlify</h3>\n<p>Netlify offers a built-in authentication service called Identity. In order to use it, connect your site repo with Netlify. Netlify has published a general <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/\">Step-by-Step Guide</a> for this, along with detailed guides for many popular static site generators, including <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/21/a-step-by-step-guide-victor-hugo-on-netlify/\">Hugo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/26/a-step-by-step-guide-hexo-on-netlify/\">Hexo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/01/a-step-by-step-guide-middleman-on-netlify/\">Middleman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/\">Gatsby</a>, and more.</p>\n<h3>Enable Identity and Git Gateway</h3>\n<p>Netlify's Identity and Git Gateway services allow you to manage CMS admin users for your site without requiring them to have an account with your Git host or commit access on your repo. From your site dashboard on Netlify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Settings > Identity</strong>, and select <strong>Enable Identity service</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Registration preferences</strong>, select <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Invite only</strong>. In most cases, you want only invited users to access your CMS, but if you're just experimenting, you can leave it open for convenience.</li>\n<li>If you'd like to allow one-click login with services like Google and GitHub, check the boxes next to the services you'd like to use, under <strong>External providers</strong>.</li>\n<li>Scroll down to <strong>Services > Git Gateway</strong>, and click <strong>Enable Git Gateway</strong>. This authenticates with your Git host and generates an API access token. In this case, we're leaving the <strong>Roles</strong> field blank, which means any logged in user may access the CMS. For information on changing this, check the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/\">Netlify Identity documentation</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Add the Netlify Identity Widget</h3>\n<p>With the backend set to handle authentication, now you need a frontend interface to connect to it. The open source Netlify Identity Widget is a drop-in widget made for just this purpose. To include the widget in your site, add the following script tag in two places:</p>\n<p>Add this to the &#x3C;head> of your CMS index page at /admin/index.html, as well as the &#x3C;head> of your site's main index page. Depending on how your site generator is set up, this may mean you need to add it to the default template, or to a \"partial\" or \"include\" template. If you can find where the site stylesheet is linked, that's probably the right place. Alternatively, you can include the script in your site using Netlify's <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/inject-analytics-snippets/\">Script Injection</a> feature.</p>\n<p>When a user logs in with the Netlify Identity widget, an access token directs to the site homepage. In order to complete the login and get back to the CMS, redirect the user back to the /admin/ path. To do this, add the following script before the closing body tag of your site's main index page:</p>\n<p>Note: This example script requires modern JavaScript and does not work on IE11. For legacy browser support, use function expressions (function () {}) in place of the arrow functions (() => {}), or use a transpiler such as <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>.</p>\n<h2>Accessing the CMS</h2>\n<p>Your site CMS is now fully configured and ready for login!</p>\n<p>If you set your registration preference to \"Invite only,\" invite yourself (and anyone else you choose) as a site user. To do this, select the <strong>Identity</strong> tab from your site dashboard, and then select the <strong>Invite users</strong> button. Invited users receive an email invitation with a confirmation link. Clicking the link will take you to your site with a login prompt.</p>\n<p>If you left your site registration open, or for return visits after confirming an email invitation, access your site's CMS at yoursite.com/admin/.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> No matter where you access Netlify CMS — whether running locally, in a staging environment, or in your published site — it always fetches and commits files in your hosted repository (for example, on GitHub), on the branch you configured in your Netlify CMS config.yml file. This means that content fetched in the admin UI matches the content in the repository, which may be different from your locally running site. It also means that content saved using the admin UI saves directly to the hosted repository, even if you're running the UI locally or in staging.</p>\n<p>Examples</p>\n<p>Do\nyou have a great, open source example?

Now, let's recreate this using Netlify CMS.</p>\n<h2>Add Netlify CMS to your site</h2>\n<p>First let's install some dependencies. We'll need netlify-cms-app and gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms. Run the following command in the terminal at the root of your site:</p>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>For the purpose of this guide we will deploy to Netlify from a GitHub repository which requires the minimum configuration.</p>\n<p>Create a config.yml file in the directory structure you see below:</p>\n<p>In your config.yml file paste the following configuration:</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above configuration allows assets to be stored relative to their content. Therefore posts would be stored in the format below as it is in gatsby-starter-blog.</p>\n<p>Finally, add the plugin to your gatsby-config.js.</p>\n<h3>Push to GitHub</h3>\n<p>It's now time to commit your changes and push to GitHub. The Gatsby starter initializes Git automatically for you, so you only need to do:</p>\n<h3>Add your repo to Netlify</h3>\n<p>Go to Netlify and select 'New Site from Git'. Select GitHub and the repository you just pushed to. Click Configure Netlify on GitHub and give access to your repository. Finish the setup by clicking Deploy Site. Netlify will begin reading your repository and starting building your project.</p>\n<h3>Enable Identity and Git Gateway</h3>\n<p>Netlify's Identity and Git Gateway services allow you to manage CMS admin users for your site without requiring them to have an account with your Git host or commit access on your repo. From your site dashboard on Netlify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Settings > Identity</strong>, and select <strong>Enable Identity service</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Registration preferences</strong>, select <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Invite only</strong>. In most cases, you want only invited users to access your CMS, but if you're just experimenting, you can leave it open for convenience.</li>\n<li>If you'd like to allow one-click login with services like Google and GitHub, check the boxes next to the services you'd like to use, under <strong>External providers</strong>.</li>\n<li>Scroll down to <strong>Services > Git Gateway</strong>, and click <strong>Enable Git Gateway</strong>. This authenticates with your Git host and generates an API access token. In this case, we're leaving the <strong>Roles</strong> field blank, which means any logged in user may access the CMS. For information on changing this, check the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/\">Netlify Identity documentation</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Start publishing</h2>\n<p>It's time to create your first blog post. Login to your site's /admin/ page and create a new post by clicking New Blog. Add a title, a date and some text. When you click Publish, a new commit will be created in your GitHub repo with this format Create Blog \"year-month-date-title\".</p>\n<p>Then Netlify will detect that there was a commit in your repo, and will start rebuilding your project. When your project is deployed you'll be able to see the post you created.</p>\n<h3>Cleanup</h3>\n<p>It is now safe to remove the default Gatsby blog posts.</p>"},{"url":"/blog/platform-docs/","relativePath":"blog/platform-docs.md","relativeDir":"blog","base":"platform-docs.md","name":"platform-docs","frontmatter":{"title":"Netlify CMS Intro","date":"2021-05-23","image":"images/curious-europa.gif","seo":{"title":"Platform Docs","description":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit","extra":[{"name":"og:type","value":"article","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:title","value":"Platform Docs","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:description","value":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:image","value":"images/curious-europa.gif","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":true},{"name":"twitter:card","value":"summary_large_image"},{"name":"twitter:title","value":"Platform Docs"},{"name":"twitter:description","value":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit"},{"name":"twitter:image","value":"images/curious-europa.gif","relativeUrl":true}]},"template":"post","thumb_image":"images/redu-squarex.jpg"},"html":"<h1>Add to Your Site | Netlify CMS</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Open source content management for your Git workflow</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can adapt Netlify CMS to a wide variety of projects. It works with any content written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/\">GitLab</a>, or <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\">Bitbucket</a>. You can also create your own custom backend.</p>\n<p>This tutorial guides you through the steps for adding Netlify CMS to a site that's built with a common <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\">static site generator</a>, like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, you can <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/start-with-a-template\">start from a template</a> or dive right into <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/configuration-options\">configuration options</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#app-file-structure\"></a>App File Structure</h2>\n<p>A static <code>admin</code> folder contains all Netlify CMS files, stored at the root of your published site. Where you store this folder in the source files depends on your static site generator. Here's the static file location for a few of the most popular static site generators:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>These generators</th>\n<th>store static files in</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Jekyll, GitBook</td>\n<td><code>/</code> (project root)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hugo, Gatsby, Nuxt, Gridsome, Zola, Sapper</td>\n<td><code>/static</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Next</td>\n<td><code>/public</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hexo, Middleman, Jigsaw</td>\n<td><code>/source</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spike</td>\n<td><code>/views</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyam</td>\n<td><code>/input</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pelican</td>\n<td><code>/content</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VuePress</td>\n<td><code>/.vuepress/public</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elmstatic</td>\n<td><code>/_site</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11ty</td>\n<td><code>/_site</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>preact-cli</td>\n<td><code>/src/static</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If your generator isn't listed here, you can check its documentation, or as a shortcut, look in your project for a <code>css</code> or <code>images</code> folder. The contents of folders like that are usually processed as static files, so it's likely you can store your <code>admin</code> folder next to those. (When you've found the location, feel free to add it to these docs by <a href=\"https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests\">filing a pull request</a>!)</p>\n<p>Inside the <code>admin</code> folder, you'll create two files:</p>\n<pre><code>admin\n ├ index.html\n └ config.yml\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first file, <code>admin/index.html</code>, is the entry point for the Netlify CMS admin interface. This means that users navigate to <code>yoursite.com/admin/</code> to access it. On the code side, it's a basic HTML starter page that loads the Netlify CMS JavaScript file. In this example, we pull the file from a public CDN:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;!doctype html>\n&#x3C;html>\n&#x3C;head>\n  &#x3C;meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n  &#x3C;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n  &#x3C;title>Content Manager&#x3C;/title>\n&#x3C;/head>\n&#x3C;body>\n\n  &#x3C;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n&#x3C;/body>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the code above the <code>script</code> is loaded from the <code>unpkg</code> CDN. Should there be any issue, <code>jsDelivr</code> can be used as an alternative source. Simply set the <code>src</code> to <code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js</code></p>\n<p>The second file, <code>admin/config.yml</code>, is the heart of your Netlify CMS installation, and a bit more complex. The <a href=\"#configuration\">Configuration</a> section covers the details.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#installing-with-npm\"></a>Installing with npm</h3>\n<p>You can also use Netlify CMS as an npm module. Wherever you import Netlify CMS, it automatically runs, taking over the current page. Make sure the script that imports it only runs on your CMS page. First install the package and save it to your project:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install netlify-cms-app --save\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then import it (assuming your project has tooling for imports):</p>\n<pre><code>import CMS from 'netlify-cms-app'\n\nCMS.init()\n\nCMS.registerPreviewTemplate('my-template', MyTemplate)\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#configuration\"></a>Configuration</h2>\n<p>Configuration is different for every site, so we'll break it down into parts. Add all the code snippets in this section to your <code>admin/config.yml</code> file.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#backend\"></a>Backend</h3>\n<p>We're using <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> for our hosting and authentication in this tutorial, so backend configuration is fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p>For GitHub and GitLab repositories, you can start your Netlify CMS <code>config.yml</code> file with these lines:</p>\n<pre><code>backend:\n  name: git-gateway\n  branch: master\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>(For Bitbucket repositories, use the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/bitbucket-backend\">Bitbucket backend</a> instructions instead.)</em></p>\n<p>The configuration above specifies your backend protocol and your publication branch. Git Gateway is an open source API that acts as a proxy between authenticated users of your site and your site repo. (We'll get to the details of that in the <a href=\"#authentication\">Authentication section</a> below.) If you leave out the <code>branch</code> declaration, it defaults to <code>master</code>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#editorial-workflow\"></a>Editorial Workflow</h3>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Editorial workflow works with GitHub repositories, and support for GitLab and Bitbucket is <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/beta-features/#gitlab-and-bitbucket-editorial-workflow-support\">in beta</a>.</p>\n<p>By default, saving a post in the CMS interface pushes a commit directly to the publication branch specified in <code>backend</code>. However, you also have the option to enable the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/configuration-options/#publish-mode\">Editorial Workflow</a>, which adds an interface for drafting, reviewing, and approving posts. To do this, add the following line to your Netlify CMS <code>config.yml</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>publish_mode: editorial_workflow\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a href=\"#media-and-public-folders\"></a>Media and Public Folders</h3>\n<p>Netlify CMS allows users to upload images directly within the editor. For this to work, the CMS needs to know where to save them. If you already have an <code>images</code> folder in your project, you could use its path, possibly creating an <code>uploads</code> sub-folder, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>media_folder: \"images/uploads\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you're creating a new folder for uploaded media, you'll need to know where your static site generator expects static files. You can refer to the paths outlined above in <a href=\"#app-file-structure\">App File Structure</a>, and put your media folder in the same location where you put the <code>admin</code> folder.</p>\n<p>Note that the<code>media_folder</code> file path is relative to the project root, so the example above would work for Jekyll, GitBook, or any other generator that stores static files at the project root. However, it would not work for Hugo, Hexo, Middleman or others that store static files in a subfolder. Here's an example that could work for a Hugo site:</p>\n<pre><code>media_folder: \"static/images/uploads\"\npublic_folder: \"/images/uploads\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The configuration above adds a new setting, <code>public_folder</code>. While <code>media_folder</code> specifies where uploaded files are saved in the repo, <code>public_folder</code> indicates where they are found in the published site. Image <code>src</code> attributes use this path, which is relative to the file where it's called. For this reason, we usually start the path at the site root, using the opening <code>/</code>.</p>\n<p><em>If `public</em>folder<code>is not set, Netlify CMS defaults to the same value as</code>media<em>folder<code>, adding an opening</code>/` if one is not included.</em></p>\n<h3><a href=\"#collections\"></a>Collections</h3>\n<p>Collections define the structure for the different content types on your static site. Since every site is different, the <code>collections</code> settings differ greatly from one site to the next.</p>\n<p>Let's say your site has a blog, with the posts stored in <code>_posts/blog</code>, and files saved in a date-title format, like <code>1999-12-31-lets-party.md</code>. Each post begins with settings in yaml-formatted front matter, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>---\nlayout: blog\ntitle: \"Let's Party\"\ndate: 1999-12-31 11:59:59 -0800\nthumbnail: \"/images/prince.jpg\"\nrating: 5\n---\n\nThis is the post body, where I write about our last chance to party before the Y2K bug destroys us all.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Given this example, our <code>collections</code> settings would look like this in your NetlifyCMS <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>collections:\n  - name: \"blog\"\n    label: \"Blog\"\n    folder: \"_posts/blog\"\n    create: true\n    slug: \"{{year}}-{{month}}-{{day}}-{{slug}}\"\n    fields:\n      - {label: \"Layout\", name: \"layout\", widget: \"hidden\", default: \"blog\"}\n      - {label: \"Title\", name: \"title\", widget: \"string\"}\n      - {label: \"Publish Date\", name: \"date\", widget: \"datetime\"}\n      - {label: \"Featured Image\", name: \"thumbnail\", widget: \"image\"}\n      - {label: \"Rating (scale of 1-5)\", name: \"rating\", widget: \"number\"}\n      - {label: \"Body\", name: \"body\", widget: \"markdown\"}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's break that down:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><code>name</code></td><td>Post type identifier, used in routes. Must be unique.</td></tr><tr><td><code>label</code></td><td>What the admin UI calls the post type.</td></tr><tr><td><code>folder</code></td><td>Where files of this type are stored, relative to the repo root.</td></tr><tr><td><code>create</code></td><td>Set to <code>true</code> to allow users to create new files in this collection.</td></tr><tr><td><code>slug</code></td><td>Template for filenames. <code>{{year}}</code>, <code>{{month}}</code>, and <code>{{day}}</code> pulls from the post's <code>date</code> field or save date. <code>{{slug}}</code> is a url-safe version of the post's <code>title</code>. Default is simply <code>{{slug}}</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>fields</code></td><td>Fields listed here are shown as fields in the content editor, then saved as front matter at the beginning of the document (except for <code>body</code>, which follows the front matter). Each field contains the following properties:<ul><li><code>label</code>: Field label in the editor UI.</li><li><code>name</code>: Field name in the document front matter.</li><li><code>widget</code>: Determines UI style and value data type (details below).</li><li><code>default</code> (optional): Sets a default value for the field.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>As described above, the <code>widget</code> property specifies a built-in or custom UI widget for a given field. When a content editor enters a value into a widget, that value is saved in the document front matter as the value for the <code>name</code> specified for that field. A full listing of available widgets can be found in the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/widgets\">Widgets doc</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on this example, you can go through the post types in your site and add the appropriate settings to your Netlify CMS <code>config.yml</code> file. Each post type should be listed as a separate node under the <code>collections</code> field. See the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/configuration-options/#collections\">Collections reference doc</a> for more configuration options.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#filter\"></a>Filter</h3>\n<p>The entries for any collection can be filtered based on the value of a single field. The example collection below only shows post entries with the value <code>en</code> in the <code>language</code> field.</p>\n<pre><code>collections:\n  - name: \"posts\"\n    label: \"Post\"\n    folder: \"_posts\"\n    filter:\n      field: language\n      value: en\n    fields:\n      - {label: \"Language\", name: \"language\"}\n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"#authentication\"></a>Authentication</h2>\n<p>Now that you have your Netlify CMS files in place and configured, all that's left is to enable authentication. We're using the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> platform here because it's one of the quickest ways to get started, but you can learn about other authentication options in the <a href=\"chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/backends-overview\">Backends</a> doc.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#setup-on-netlify\"></a>Setup on Netlify</h3>\n<p>Netlify offers a built-in authentication service called Identity. In order to use it, connect your site repo with Netlify. Netlify has published a general <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/\">Step-by-Step Guide</a> for this, along with detailed guides for many popular static site generators, including <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/21/a-step-by-step-guide-victor-hugo-on-netlify/\">Hugo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/26/a-step-by-step-guide-hexo-on-netlify/\">Hexo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/01/a-step-by-step-guide-middleman-on-netlify/\">Middleman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/\">Gatsby</a>, and more.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"#enable-identity-and-git-gateway\"></a>Enable Identity and Git Gateway</h3>\n<p>Netlify's Identity and Git Gateway services allow you to manage CMS admin users for your site without requiring them to have an account with your Git host or commit access on your repo. From your site dashboard on Netlify:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Settings > Identity</strong>, and select <strong>Enable Identity service</strong>.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Registration preferences</strong>, select <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Invite only</strong>. In most cases, you want only invited users to access your CMS, but if you're just experimenting, you can leave it open for convenience.</li>\n<li>If you'd like to allow one-click login with services like Google and GitHub, check the boxes next to the services you'd like to use, under <strong>External providers</strong>.</li>\n<li>Scroll down to <strong>Services > Git Gateway</strong>, and click <strong>Enable Git Gateway</strong>. This authenticates with your Git host and generates an API access token. In this case, we're leaving the <strong>Roles</strong> field blank, which means any logged in user may access the CMS. For information on changing this, check the <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/\">Netlify Identity documentation</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a href=\"#add-the-netlify-identity-widget\"></a>Add the Netlify Identity Widget</h3>\n<p>With the backend set to handle authentication, now you need a frontend interface to connect to it. The open source Netlify Identity Widget is a drop-in widget made for just this purpose. To include the widget in your site, add the following script tag in two places:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;script src=\"https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Add this to the <code>&#x3C;head></code> of your CMS index page at <code>/admin/index.html</code>, as well as the <code>&#x3C;head></code> of your site's main index page. Depending on how your site generator is set up, this may mean you need to add it to the default template, or to a \"partial\" or \"include\" template. If you can find where the site stylesheet is linked, that's probably the right place. Alternatively, you can include the script in your site using Netlify's <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/docs/inject-analytics-snippets/\">Script Injection</a> feature.</p>\n<p>When a user logs in with the Netlify Identity widget, an access token directs to the site homepage. In order to complete the login and get back to the CMS, redirect the user back to the <code>/admin/</code> path. To do this, add the following script before the closing <code>body</code> tag of your site's main index page:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;script>\n  if (window.netlifyIdentity) {\n    window.netlifyIdentity.on(\"init\", user => {\n      if (!user) {\n        window.netlifyIdentity.on(\"login\", () => {\n          document.location.href = \"/admin/\";\n        });\n      }\n    });\n  }\n&#x3C;/script>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: This example script requires modern JavaScript and does not work on IE11. For legacy browser support, use function expressions (<code>function () {}</code>) in place of the arrow functions (<code>() => {}</code>), or use a transpiler such as <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#accessing-the-cms\"></a>Accessing the CMS</h2>\n<p>Your site CMS is now fully configured and ready for login!</p>\n<p>If you set your registration preference to \"Invite only,\" invite yourself (and anyone else you choose) as a site user. To do this, select the <strong>Identity</strong> tab from your site dashboard, and then select the <strong>Invite users</strong> button. Invited users receive an email invitation with a confirmation link. Clicking the link will take you to your site with a login prompt.</p>\n<p>If you left your site registration open, or for return visits after confirming an email invitation, access your site's CMS at <code>yoursite.com/admin/</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> No matter where you access Netlify CMS — whether running locally, in a staging environment, or in your published site — it always fetches and commits files in your hosted repository (for example, on GitHub), on the branch you configured in your Netlify CMS config.yml file. This means that content fetched in the admin UI matches the content in the repository, which may be different from your locally running site.

My most medium apologies to Leonhard Euler.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type Casting</strong> : The process of converting one number to another.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The arithmetic operators are the same between JS and Python, with two additions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\"**\" : Double asterisk for exponent.</em></li>\n<li><em>\"//\" : Integer Division.</em></li>\n<li><strong>There are no spaces between math operations in Python.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Integer Division gives the other part of the number from Module; it is a way to do round down numbers replacing Math.floor() in JS.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>There are no ++ and -- in Python, the only shorthand operators are:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Strings</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Python uses both single and double quotes.</li>\n<li>You can escape strings like so 'Jodi asked, \"What\\'s up, Sam?\"'</li>\n<li>Multiline strings use triple quotes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use the len() function to get the length of a string.</strong></p>\n<h1><strong>Python uses zero-based indexing</strong></h1>\n<h2>Python allows negative indexing (thank god!)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Python let's you use ranges</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can think of this as roughly equivalent to the slice method called on a JavaScript object or string… *(mind you that in JS … strings are wrapped in an object (under the hood)… upon which the string methods are actually called. As a immutable privative type <strong>by textbook definition</strong>, a string literal could not hope to invoke most of it's methods without violating the state it was bound to on initialization if it were not for this bit of syntactic sugar.)*</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The end range is exclusive just like slice in JS.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>The index string function is the equiv. of indexOf() in JS</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>The count function finds out how many times a substring appears in a string… pretty nifty for a hard coded feature of the language.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You can use + to concatenate strings, just like in JS.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>You can also use \"*\" to repeat strings or multiply strings.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Use the format() function to use placeholders in a string to input values later on.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>*Shorthand way to use format function is:\n*print(f'Your name is {first<em>name} {last</em>name}')</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Some useful string methods.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Note that in JS join is used on an Array, in Python it is used on String.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>There are also many handy testing methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Variables and Expressions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Duck-Typing</strong> : Programming Style which avoids checking an object's type to figure out what it can do.</li>\n<li>Duck Typing is the fundamental approach of Python.</li>\n<li>Assignment of a value automatically declares a variable.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>You can chain variable assignments to give multiple var names the same value.</em></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Use with caution as this is highly unreadable</h2>\n<h2>The value and type of a variable can be re-assigned at any time.</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>*NaN does not exist in Python, but you can 'create' it like so:\n<strong>print(float(\"nan\"))*</strong></li>\n<li><em>Python replaces null with none.</em></li>\n<li><strong>*none is an object</strong> and can be directly assigned to a variable.*</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using none is a convenient way to check to see why an action may not be operating correctly in your program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Boolean Data Type</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the biggest benefits of Python is that it reads more like English than JS does.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>By default, Python considers an object to be true UNLESS it is one of the following:</li>\n<li>Constant None or False</li>\n<li>Zero of any numeric type.</li>\n<li>Empty Sequence or Collection.</li>\n<li>True and False must be capitalized</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Comparison Operators</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Python uses all the same equality operators as JS.</li>\n<li>In Python, equality operators are processed from left to right.</li>\n<li>Logical operators are processed in this order:</li>\n<li><strong>NOT</strong></li>\n<li><strong>AND</strong></li>\n<li><strong>OR</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just like in JS, you can use parentheses to change the inherent order of operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Short Circuit</strong> : Stopping a program when a true or false has been reached.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Identity vs Equality</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Python community it is better to use is and is not over == or !=</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>If Statements</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember the order of elif statements matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>While Statements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Break statement also exists in Python.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>As are continue statements</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Try/Except Statements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Python equivalent to try/catch</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>You can name an error to give the output more specificity.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>You can also use the pass commmand to by pass a certain error.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>The pass method won't allow you to bypass every single error so you can chain an exception series like so:</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>You can use an else statement to end a chain of except statements.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>finally is used at the end to clean up all actions under any circumstance.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>Using duck typing to check to see if some value is able to use a certain method.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pass</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Pass Keyword is required to write the JS equivalent of :</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Functions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Function definition includes:</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The def keyword</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The name of the function</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A list of parameters enclosed in parentheses.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A colon at the end of the line.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>One tab indentation for the code to run.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>You can use default parameters just like in JS</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Keep in mind, default parameters must always come after regular parameters.</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>You can specify arguments by name without destructuring in Python.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>The lambda keyword is used to create anonymous functions and are supposed to be one-liners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>toUpper = lambda s: s.upper()</p>\n<h1>Notes</h1>\n<h2>Formatted Strings</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember that in Python join() is called on a string with an array/list passed in as the argument.\nPython has a very powerful formatting engine.\nformat() is also applied directly to strings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Comma Thousands Separator</h1>\n<h1>Date and Time</h1>\n<h1>Percentage</h1>\n<h1>Data

parentheses</h2>\n<h2>Sometimes instantiated without</h2>\n<h2>Tuple() built in can be used to convert other data into a tuple</h2>\n<h2>Ranges : A list of numbers which can't be changed; often used with for loops.</h2>\n<p><strong>Declared using one to three parameters</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Start : opt. default 0, first # in sequence.\nStop : required next number past the last number in the sequence.\nStep : opt. default 1, difference between each number in the sequence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Dictionaries : Mappable collection where a hashable value is used as a key to ref. an object stored in the dictionary.</h2>\n<h2>Mutable.</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Declared with curly braces of the built in dict()</em></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Benefit of dictionaries in Python is that it doesn't matter how it is defined, if the keys and values are the same the dictionaries are considered equal.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Use the in operator to see if a key exists in a dictionary.</strong></p>\n<p>S<strong>ets : Unordered collection of distinct objects; objects that need to be hashable.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Always be unique, duplicate items are auto dropped from the set.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Common Uses:</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Removing Duplicates\nMembership Testing\nMathematical Operators: Intersection, Union, Difference, Symmetric

Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>\n<li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>\n<li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Installing Python:</h3>\n<h3>Windows</h3>\n<p>To determine if your Windows computer already has Python 3:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a command prompt by entering command prompt in the Windows 10 search box and selecting the Command Prompt App in the Best match section of the results.</li>\n<li>Enter the following command and then select the Enter key:</li>\n<li>ConsoleCopy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>python --version</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Running python --version may not return a value, or may return an error message stating <em>'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</em> This indicates Python is not installed on your Windows system.</li>\n<li>If you see the word Python with a set of numbers separated by . characters, some version of Python is installed.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>i.e.</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Python 3.8.0</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>As long as the first number is 3</strong>, you have Python 3 installed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Download Page:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/\">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Download Link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.5/python-3.9.5-amd64.exe\">https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.5/python-3.9.5-amd64.exe</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Install Jupyter Notebooks:</h3>\n<h3>pip</h3>\n<p>If you use pip, you can install it with:</p>\n<p>If installing using pip install --user, you must add the user-level bin directory to your PATH environment variable in order to launch jupyter lab. If you are using a Unix derivative (FreeBSD, GNU / Linux, OS X), you can achieve this by using export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\" command.</p>\n<h3>pipenv</h3>\n<p>If you use pipenv, you can install it as:</p>\n<p>or from a git checkout:</p>\n<p>When using pipenv, in order to launch jupyter lab, you must activate the project's virtualenv. For example, in the directory where pipenv's Pipfile and Pipfile.lock live (i.e., where you ran the above commands):</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can run jupyter lab inside the virtualenv with</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bgoonz/Jupyter-Notebooks/tree/master/\">Jupyter Notebook Viewer</a></p>\n<h3>Python Syntax</h3>\n<p>Python syntax was made for readability, and easy editing. For example, the python language uses a : and indented code, while javascript and others generally use {} and indented code.</p>\n<h3>First Program</h3>\n<p>Lets create a <a href=\"https://repl.it/languages/python3\">python 3</a> repl, and call it <em>Hello World</em>. Now you have a blank file called <em>main.py</em>. Now let us write our first line of code:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first \"Hello, World!\" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, press the run button, which obviously runs the code. If you are not using replit, this will not work. You should research how to run a file with your text editor.</p>\n<h3>Command Line</h3>\n<p>If you look to your left at the console where hello world was just printed, you can see a >, >>>, or $ depending on what you are using. After the prompt, try typing a line of code.</p>\n<p>The command line allows you to execute single lines of code at a time. It is often used when trying out a new function or method in the language.</p>\n<h3>New: Comments!</h3>\n<p>Another cool thing that you can generally do with all languages, are comments. In python, a comment starts with a #. The computer ignores all text starting after the #.</p>\n<p># Write some comments!</p>\n<p>If you have a huge comment, do <strong>not</strong> comment all the 350 lines, just put ''' before it, and ''' at the end. Technically, this is not a comment but a string, but the computer still ignores it, so we will use it.</p>\n<h3>New: Variables!</h3>\n<p>Unlike many other languages, there is no var, let, or const to declare a variable in python. You simply go name = 'value'.</p>\n<p>Remember, there is a difference between integers and strings. <em>Remember: String = \"\".</em> To convert between these two, you can put an int in a str() function, and a string in a int() function. There is also a less used one, called a float. Mainly, these are integers with decimals. Change them using the float() command.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://repl.it/@bgoonz/second-scr?lite=true&#x26;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbryanguner.medium.com\">https://repl.it/@bgoonz/second-scr?lite=true&#x26;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbryanguner.medium.com</a></p>\n<p>Instead of using the , in the print function, you can put a + to combine the variables and string.</p>\n<h3>Operators</h3>\n<p>There are many operators in python:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>+</li>\n<li>-</li>\n<li>/</li>\n<li>*\nThese operators are the same in most languages, and allow for addition, subtraction, division, and multiplicaiton.\nNow, we can look at a few more complicated ones:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>simpleops.py</em></p>\n<p>You should already know everything shown above, as it is similar to other languages. If you continue down, you will see more complicated ones.</p>\n<p><em>complexop.py</em></p>\n<p>The ones above are to edit the current value of the variable.\nSorry to JS users, as there is no i++; or anything.</p>\n<h3><em>Fun Fact:\nThe python language was named after Monty Python.</em></h3>\n<p>If you really want to know about the others, view <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm\">Py Operators</a></p>\n<h3>More Things With Strings</h3>\n<p>Like the title?\nAnyways, a ' and a \" both indicate a string, but <strong>do not combine them!</strong></p>\n<p><em>quotes.py</em></p>\n<p><em>slicing.py</em></p>\n<h3>String Slicing</h3>\n<p>You can look at only certain parts of the string by slicing it, using [num:num].\nThe first number stands for how far in you go from the front, and the second stands for how far in you go from the back.</p>\n<h3>Methods and Functions</h3>\n<p>Here is a list of functions/methods we will go over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.strip()</li>\n<li>len()</li>\n<li>.lower()</li>\n<li>.upper()</li>\n<li>.replace()</li>\n<li>.split()</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New: Input()</h3>\n<p>Input is a function that gathers input entered from the user in the command line. It takes one optional parameter, which is the users prompt.</p>\n<p><em>inp.py</em></p>\n<p>If you wanted to make it smaller, and look neater to the user, you could do…</p>\n<p><em>inp2.py</em></p>\n<p>Running:\n<em>inp.py</em></p>\n<p><em>inp2.py</em></p>\n<h3>New: Importing Modules</h3>\n<p>Python has created a lot of functions that are located in other .py files. You need to import these <strong>modules</strong> to gain access to the,, You may wonder why python did this. The purpose of separate modules is to make python faster. Instead of storing millions and millions of functions, , it only needs a few basic ones. To import a module, you must write input &#x3C;modulename>. Do not add the .py extension to the file name. In this example , we will be using a python created module named random.</p>\n<p><em>module.py</em></p>\n<p>Now, I have access to all functions in the random.py file. To access a specific function in the module, you would do &#x3C;module>.&#x3C;function>. For example:</p>\n<p><em>module2.py</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>*Pro Tip:\nDo from random import randint to not have to do random.randint(), just randint()\nTo import all functions from a module, you could do from random import **</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>New: Loops!</h3>\n<p>Loops allow you to repeat code over and over again. This is useful if you want to print Hi with a delay of one second 100 times.</p>\n<h4>for Loop</h4>\n<p>The for loop goes through a list of variables, making a seperate variable equal one of the list every time.\nLet's say we wanted to create the example above.</p>\n<p><em>loop.py</em></p>\n<p>This will print Hello with a .3 second delay 100 times. This is just one way to use it, but it is usually used like this:</p>\n<p><em>loop2.py</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1539649280875_37d22e6d49e8e8fbc453631def345387.pn\">https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1539649280875_37d22e6d49e8e8fbc453631def345387.pn</a></p>\n<h4>while Loop</h4>\n<p>The while loop runs the code while something stays true. You would put while &#x3C;expression>. Every time the loop runs, it evaluates if the expression is True. It it is, it runs the code, if not it continues outside of the loop. For example:</p>\n<p><em>while.py</em></p>\n<p>Or you could do:</p>\n<p><em>while2.py</em></p>\n<h3>New: if Statement</h3>\n<p>The if statement allows you to check if something is True. If so, it runs the code, if not, it continues on. It is kind of like a while loop, but it executes <strong>only once</strong>. An if statement is written:</p>\n<p><em>if.py</em></p>\n<p>Now, you may think that it would be better if you could make it print only one message. Not as many that are True. You can do that with an elif statement:</p>\n<p><em>elif.py</em></p>\n<p>Now, you may wonder how to run code if none work. Well, there is a simple statement called else:</p>\n<p><em>else.py</em></p>\n<h3>New: Functions (def)</h3>\n<p>So far, you have only seen how to use functions other people have made. Let use the example that you want to print the a random number between 1 and 9, and print different text every time.\nIt is quite tiring to type:</p>\n<p>Characters: 389</p>\n<p><em>nofunc.py</em></p>\n<p>Now with functions, you can seriously lower the amount of characters:</p>\n<p>Characters: 254</p>\n<p><em>functions.py</em></p>\n<h3>Project Based Learning:</h3>\n<p>The following is a modified version of a tutorial posted By: <a href=\"https://replit.com/@InvisibleOne\">InvisibleOne </a></p>\n<p>I would cite the original tutorial it's self but at the time of this writing I can no longer find it on his repl.it profile and so the only reference I have are my own notes from following the tutorial when I first found it.</p>\n<h3>1. Adventure Story</h3>\n<p>The first thing you need with an adventure story is a great storyline, something that is exciting and fun. The idea is, that at each pivotal point in the story, you give the player the opportunity to make a choice.\nFirst things first, let's import the stuff that we need, like this:</p>\n<p>Now, we need some variables to hold some of the player data.</p>\n<p>Ok, now we have the player's name and nickname, let's welcome them to the game</p>\n<p>Now for the story. The most important part of all stories is the introduction, so let's print our introduction</p>\n<p>Now, we'll give the player their first choice</p>\n<p>There you have it, a pretty simple choose your own ending story. You can make it as complex or uncomplex as you like.</p>\n<h3>2. TEXT ENCODER</h3>\n<p>Ever make secret messages as a kid? I used to. Anyways, here's the way you can make a program to encode messages! It's pretty simple. First things first, let's get the message the user wants to encode, we'll use input() for that:</p>\n<p>Now we need to split that string into a list of characters, this part is a bit more complicated.</p>\n<p>Now we need to convert the characters into code, well do this with a for loop:</p>\n<p>Once we've encoded the text, we'll print it back for the user</p>\n<p>And if you want to decode something, it is this same process but in reverse!</p>\n<h3>3. Guess my Number</h3>\n<p>Number guessing games are fun and pretty simple, all you need are a few loops. To start, we need to import random.</p>\n<p>That is pretty simple. Now we'll make a list with the numbers were want available for the game</p>\n<p>Next, we get a random number from the list</p>\n<p>Now, we need to ask the user for input, we'll to this with a while loop</p>\n<p>Have fun with this!</p>\n<h3>4. Notes</h3>\n<p>Here is a more advanced project, but still pretty easy. This will be using a txt file to save some notes. The first thing we need to do is to create a txt file in your repl, name it 'notes.txt'\nNow, to open a file in python we use open('filename', type) The type can be 'r' for read, or 'w' for write. There is another option, but we won't be using that here. Now, the first thing we are going to do is get what the user would like to save:</p>\n<p>Now we'll open our file and save that text</p>\n<p>There we go, now the information is in the file. Next, we'll retrieve it</p>\n<p>There we go, that's how you can open files and close files with python</p>\n<h3>5. Random Dare Generator</h3>\n<p>Who doesn't love a good dare? Here is a program that can generate random dares. The first thing we'll need to do is as always, import random. Then we'll make some lists of dares</p>"},{"url":"/blog/web-dev-trends/","relativePath":"blog/web-dev-trends.md","relativeDir":"blog","base":"web-dev-trends.md","name":"web-dev-trends","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Development Tools","subtitle":"In 2021","date":"2021-09-30","thumb_image_alt":"lorem-ipsum","excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"post","thumb_image":"images/webdev.png"},"html":"<p><strong>1.

A list of the names and birthdays of all 45 U.S. presidents. Using just the request-promise module and Cheerio.js should allow you to scrape the vast majority of sites on the internet.</p>\n<p>Recently, however, many sites have begun using JavaScript to generate dynamic content on their websites. This causes a problem for request-promise and other similar HTTP request libraries (such as axios and fetch), because they only get the response from the initial request, but they cannot execute the JavaScript the way a web browser can.</p>\n<p>Thus, to scrape sites that require JavaScript execution, we need another solution. In our next example, we will get the titles for all of the posts on the front page of Reddit. Let's see what happens when we try to use request-promise as we did in the previous example.</p>\n<p>Output:</p>\n<table data-tab-size=\"8\" data-paste-markdown-skip=\"\"><tbody><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L1\" data-line-number=\"1\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC1\">const rp = require('request-promise');</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L2\" data-line-number=\"2\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC2\">const url = 'https://www.reddit.com';</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L3\" data-line-number=\"3\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC3\"></td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L4\" data-line-number=\"4\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC4\">rp(url)</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L5\" data-line-number=\"5\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC5\">.then(function(html){</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L6\" data-line-number=\"6\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC6\">//success!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L7\" data-line-number=\"7\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC7\">console.log(html);</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L8\" data-line-number=\"8\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC8\">})</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L9\" data-line-number=\"9\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC9\">.catch(function(err){</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L10\" data-line-number=\"10\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC10\">//handle error</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L11\" data-line-number=\"11\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC11\">});</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-L12\" data-line-number=\"12\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-LC12\">}</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>Here's what the output looks like:</p>\n<table data-tab-size=\"8\" data-paste-markdown-skip=\"\"><tbody><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-L1\" data-line-number=\"1\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-LC1\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-L2\" data-line-number=\"2\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-LC2\">lang=\"en\"&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;reddit: the front page of the</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-L3\" data-line-number=\"3\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-LC3\">internet&lt;/title&gt;</td></tr><tr><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-L4\" data-line-number=\"4\"></td><td id=\"file-reddit-js-v1-output-LC4\">...</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*mKzPVGRR4CFKMwQw5y_YnQ.png\"></p>\n<p>Hmmm…not quite what we want. That's because getting the actual content requires you to run the JavaScript on the page! With Puppeteer, that's no problem.</p>\n<p>Puppeteer is an extremely popular new module brought to you by the Google Chrome team that allows you to control a headless browser. This is perfect for programmatically scraping pages that require JavaScript execution.

Here's a few catorizations I think are worth distinguishing for one and other.</h4>\n<h3>1. Interpersonal Connections</h3>\n<p>Seek to leverage the connections you have with people you know and companies you want to work with. I know that that's a violation of the premise of this article but without even feeling the need to provide quantitative proof; I can confidently assume that this is the most <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">RO</a>I efficient way to produce a desirable result. (Sorry introverts… 2020 may have been your year but this is our world. 😘)</p>\n<p><strong>If personal connections don't come through, the next best thing is cold outreach (<em>best in terms of results…. personally I hate cold calling strangers and I am an extrovert</em>.)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"2139\">Before or after submitting an application, <strong>identify 1–3 professionals to reach out to</strong> at the company to express interest in opportunities.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"fb8b\"><strong>Send a message to express interest and request an informational interview</strong> with the individual via LinkedIn, email, Twitter, or other available communication methods.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"840d\"><strong>If you hear back</strong> and the individual is willing to connect, <strong>confirm a day and time to conduct a preliminary interview.</strong> <em>OR</em> <strong>If you have yet to hear back after 3 business days, follow-up.</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you send off a message in step two, there are a variety of responses you may receive. Sometimes an individual will forward you along to someone who may be of better assistance, other times your message may be overlooked with no reply, and its possible (best case scenario) your request for a chat becomes an invitation to interview.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*3_3Cb73SQM_YazWGpZWtIw.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*aI1PfkSpsUks598LAJvKoQ.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*5eObFD9fV2fe5DztitZfsA.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>### ***2. LinkedIn***.\n<p>I am going to devote a lot of time to this one because it is the largest and most active of all the job board ecosystems… period… full stop regardless of your industry.</p>\n<p>LinkedIn now has <a href=\"https://news.linkedin.com/about-us#Statistics\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">almost 740 million members</a> with over 55 million registered companies. (for comparison 12.3 million people visited Indeed in October, up 19.6 percent. <a href=\"http://www.monster.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Monster.com</a> attracted 12.1 million people, and <a href=\"http://www.careerbuilder.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">CareerBuilder.com</a>attractedd 11.3 million in that same time) and LinkedIn is the most-used social media platform amongst Fortune 500 companies as it provides far more networking capabilities than pure recruitment.</p>\n<p>If you put your resume and skills on LinkedIn.com as a software Engineer, and state that you are open to new opportunities, you <em>will</em> be contacted by multiple recruiters, and if your skills are desirable possibly also directly by companies seeking to hire you. It's a developer's market; there's not enough people out there, especially in America.</p>\n<p>Here's my profile… feel free to connect… the larger your network the greater your exposure is to someone who works at your potential dream job.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guner-046199128/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-guner-046199128/\"><strong>Bryan Guner - Web Developer - Freelance | LinkedIn</strong><br />\n<em>View Bryan Guner's profile on LinkedIn, the world's largest professional community.

Your jobs teach you so much about an organization and the business.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Follow business owners and senior managers, successful team leaders in large organizations, startup owners. You would be surprised how willing some otherwise busy executives are to rub elbows with veritable newcomers. They're not just doing this out of the kindness of their hearts, just like you… they have an ulterior motive.

If that weren't enough reason, all of them come from a cohort of other individuals being instructed to do the same.

The automated email sends something to the old email, acknowledging that they changed their email, and if that isn't right, to please contact Secular Health Network. When you come into the office one morning, you see that thousands of emails have been generated in the space of two hours. What do you do?

You've implemented the rule on their demo environments and given them a testing plan that is simple and straightforward. During testing, you're included in multiple email chains with different parties, as well as some one-off calls and texts messages. Resources seem scattered, but the testing happens. After receiving confirmation from the customer that testing was successful, you're told the code is good to go into production.

JavaScript developers are not familiar with this concept, much less than C, C++ or Go developers (or any programmer that uses a system programming language), which interact with memory every day.</p>\n<p>It represents a fixed-size chunk of memory (can't be resized) allocated outside of the V8 JavaScript engine.</p>\n<p>You can think of a buffer like an array of integers, which each represent a byte of data.</p>\n<p>It is implemented by the Node.js <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html\">Buffer class</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why do we need a buffer?</h2>\n<p>Buffers were introduced to help developers deal with binary data, in an ecosystem that traditionally only dealt with strings rather than binaries.</p>\n<p>Buffers are deeply linked with streams. When a stream processor receives data faster than it can digest, it puts the data in a buffer.</p>\n<p>A simple visualization of a buffer is when you are watching a YouTube video and the red line goes beyond your visualization point: you are downloading data faster than you're viewing it, and your browser buffers it.</p>\n<h2>How to create a buffer</h2>\n<p>A buffer is created using the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer_from_buffer_alloc_and_buffer_allocunsafe\"><code>Buffer.from()</code></a>, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_alloc_size_fill_encoding\"><code>Buffer.alloc()</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_allocunsafe_size\"><code>Buffer.allocUnsafe()</code></a> methods.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_array\"><code>Buffer.from(array)</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_arraybuffer_byteoffset_length\"><code>Buffer.from(arrayBuffer[, byteOffset[, length]])</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_buffer\"><code>Buffer.from(buffer)</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_string_encoding\"><code>Buffer.from(string[, encoding])</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also just initialize the buffer passing the size. This creates a 1KB buffer:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.alloc(1024);\n//or\nconst buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(1024);\n</code></pre>\n<p>While both <code>alloc</code> and <code>allocUnsafe</code> allocate a <code>Buffer</code> of the specified size in bytes, the <code>Buffer</code> created by <code>alloc</code> will be <em>initialized</em> with zeroes and the one created by <code>allocUnsafe</code> will be <em>uninitialized</em>. This means that while <code>allocUnsafe</code> would be quite fast in comparison to <code>alloc</code>, the allocated segment of memory may contain old data which could potentially be sensitive.</p>\n<p>Older data, if present in the memory, can be accessed or leaked when the <code>Buffer</code> memory is read. This is what really makes <code>allocUnsafe</code> unsafe and extra care must be taken while using it.</p>\n<h2>Using a buffer</h2>\n<h3>Access the content of a buffer</h3>\n<p>A buffer, being an array of bytes, can be accessed like an array:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nconsole.log(buf[0]); //72\nconsole.log(buf[1]); //101\nconsole.log(buf[2]); //121\n</code></pre>\n<p>Those numbers are the Unicode Code that identifies the character in the buffer position (H => 72, e => 101, y => 121)</p>\n<p>You can print the full content of the buffer using the <code>toString()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">console.log(buf.toString());\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Notice that if you initialize a buffer with a number that sets its size, you'll get access to pre-initialized memory that will contain random data, not an empty buffer!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Get the length of a buffer</h3>\n<p>Use the <code>length</code> property:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nconsole.log(buf.length);\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Iterate over the contents of a buffer</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nfor (const item of buf) {\n    console.log(item); //72 101 121 33\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Changing the content of a buffer</h3>\n<p>You can write to a buffer a whole string of data by using the <code>write()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.alloc(4);\nbuf.write('Hey!');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just like you can access a buffer with an array syntax, you can also set the contents of the buffer in the same way:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nbuf[1] = 111; //o\nconsole.log(buf.toString()); //Hoy!\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Copy a buffer</h3>\n<p>Copying a buffer is possible using the <code>copy()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nlet bufcopy = Buffer.alloc(4); //allocate 4 bytes\nbuf.copy(bufcopy);\n</code></pre>\n<p>By default you copy the whole buffer. 3 more parameters let you define the starting position, the ending position, and the new buffer length:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nlet bufcopy = Buffer.alloc(2); //allocate 2 bytes\nbuf.copy(bufcopy, 0, 0, 2);\nbufcopy.toString(); //'He'\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Slice a buffer</h3>\n<p>If you want to create a partial visualization of a buffer, you can create a slice. A slice is not a copy: the original buffer is still the source of truth. If that changes, your slice changes.</p>\n<p>Use the <code>slice()</code> method to create it. The first parameter is the starting position, and you can specify an optional second parameter with the end position:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const buf = Buffer.from('Hey!');\nbuf.slice(0).toString(); //Hey!\nconst slice = buf.slice(0, 2);\nconsole.log(slice.toString()); //He\nbuf[1] = 111; //o\nconsole.log(slice.toString()); //Ho\n</code></pre>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/dev-dep/","relativePath":"docs/articles/dev-dep.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"dev-dep.md","name":"dev-dep","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev Dependencies","sections":[],"seo":{"title":"Dependencies","description":"install an npm package using npm install you are installing it as a dependency.

Because it explains how Node.js can be asynchronous and have non-blocking I/O, and so it explains basically the \"killer app\" of Node.js, the thing that made it this successful.</p>\n<p>The Node.js JavaScript code runs on a single thread. There is just one thing happening at a time.</p>\n<p>This is a limitation that's actually very helpful, as it simplifies a lot how you program without worrying about concurrency issues.</p>\n<p>You just need to pay attention to how you write your code and avoid anything that could block the thread, like synchronous network calls or infinite loops.</p>\n<p>In general, in most browsers there is an event loop for every browser tab, to make every process isolated and avoid a web page with infinite loops or heavy processing to block your entire browser.</p>\n<p>The environment manages multiple concurrent event loops, to handle API calls for example. Web Workers run in their own event loop as well.</p>\n<p>You mainly need to be concerned that <em>your code</em> will run on a single event loop, and write code with this thing in mind to avoid blocking it.</p>\n<h2>Blocking the event loop</h2>\n<p>Any JavaScript code that takes too long to return back control to the event loop will block the execution of any JavaScript code in the page, even block the UI thread, and the user cannot click around, scroll the page, and so on.</p>\n<p>Almost all the I/O primitives in JavaScript are non-blocking. Network requests, filesystem operations, and so on. Being blocking is the exception, and this is why JavaScript is based so much on callbacks, and more recently on promises and async/await.</p>\n<h2>The call stack</h2>\n<p>The call stack is a LIFO queue (Last In, First Out).</p>\n<p>The event loop continuously checks the <strong>call stack</strong> to see if there's any function that needs to run.</p>\n<p>While doing so, it adds any function call it finds to the call stack and executes each one in order.</p>\n<p>You know the error stack trace you might be familiar with, in the debugger or in the browser console?

Inside <code>foo()</code> we first call <code>bar()</code>, then we call <code>baz()</code>.</p>\n<p>At this point the call stack looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"call-stack-first-example.png\" alt=\"Call stack first example\"></p>\n<p>The event loop on every iteration looks if there's something in the call stack, and executes it:</p>\n<p><img src=\"execution-order-first-example.png\" alt=\"Execution order first example\"></p>\n<p>until the call stack is empty.</p>\n<h2>Queuing function execution</h2>\n<p>The above example looks normal, there's nothing special about it: JavaScript finds things to execute, runs them in order.</p>\n<p>Let's see how to defer a function until the stack is clear.</p>\n<p>The use case of <code>setTimeout(() => {}, 0)</code> is to call a function, but execute it once every other function in the code has executed.</p>\n<p>Take this example:</p>\n<iframe\n  title=\"Queuing function execution\"\n  src=\"https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/nodejs-dev-0029-02?path=server.js&previewSize=20&attributionHidden=true&sidebarCollapsed=true\"\n  alt=\"nodejs-dev-0029-02 on Glitch\"\n  style=\"height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;\">\n</iframe>\n<!--```js\nconst bar = () => console.log('bar')\n\nconst baz = () => console.log('baz')\n\nconst foo = () => {\n  console.log('foo')\n  setTimeout(bar, 0)\n  baz()\n}\n\nfoo()\n```-->\n<p>This code prints, maybe surprisingly:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">foo\nbaz\nbar\n</code></pre>\n<p>When this code runs, first foo() is called. Inside foo() we first call setTimeout, passing <code>bar</code> as an argument, and we instruct it to run immediately as fast as it can, passing 0 as the timer. Then we call baz().</p>\n<p>At this point the call stack looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"call-stack-second-example.png\" alt=\"Call stack second example\"></p>\n<p>Here is the execution order for all the functions in our program:</p>\n<p><img src=\"execution-order-second-example.png\" alt=\"Execution order second example\"></p>\n<p>Why is this happening?</p>\n<h2>The Message Queue</h2>\n<p>When setTimeout() is called, the Browser or Node.js starts the timer. Once the timer expires, in this case immediately as we put 0 as the timeout, the callback function is put in the <strong>Message Queue</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Message Queue is also where user-initiated events like click or keyboard events, or fetch responses are queued before your code has the opportunity to react to them. Or also DOM events like <code>onLoad</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>The loop gives priority to the call stack, and it first processes everything it finds in the call stack, and once there's nothing in there, it goes to pick up things in the message queue.</strong></p>\n<p>We don't have to wait for functions like <code>setTimeout</code>, fetch or other things to do their own work, because they are provided by the browser, and they live on their own threads. For example, if you set the <code>setTimeout</code> timeout to 2 seconds, you don't have to wait 2 seconds - the wait happens elsewhere.</p>\n<h2>ES6 Job Queue</h2>\n<p>ECMAScript 2015 introduced the concept of the Job Queue, which is used by Promises (also introduced in ES6/ES2015). It's a way to execute the result of an async function as soon as possible, rather than being put at the end of the call stack.</p>\n<p>Promises that resolve before the current function ends will be executed right after the current function.</p>\n<p>I find nice the analogy of a rollercoaster ride at an amusement park: the message queue puts you at the back of the queue, behind all the other people, where you will have to wait for your turn, while the job queue is the fastpass ticket that lets you take another ride right after you finished the previous one.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<iframe\n  title=\"ECMAScript 2015 Job Queue\"\n  src=\"https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/nodejs-dev-0029-03?path=server.js&previewSize=35&attributionHidden=true&sidebarCollapsed=true\"\n  alt=\"nodejs-dev-0029-03 on Glitch\"\n  style=\"height: 400px; width: 100%; border: 0;\">\n</iframe>\n<!--```js\nconst bar = () => console.log('bar')\n\nconst baz = () => console.log('baz')\n\nconst foo = () => {\n  console.log('foo')\n  setTimeout(bar, 0)\n  new Promise((resolve, reject) =>\n    resolve('should be right after baz, before bar')\n  ).then(resolve => console.log(resolve))\n  baz()\n}\n\nfoo()\n```\n\nThis prints\n\n```txt\nfoo\nbaz\nshould be right after baz, before bar\nbar\n```-->\n<p>That's a big difference between Promises (and Async/await, which is built on promises) and plain old asynchronous functions through <code>setTimeout()</code> or other platform APIs.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/fs-module/","relativePath":"docs/articles/fs-module.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"fs-module.md","name":"fs-module","frontmatter":{"title":"Fs-Module","sections":[],"seo":{"title":"","description":"Fs-Module","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>The <code>fs</code> module provides a lot of very useful functionality to access and interact with the file system.</p>\n<p>There is no need to install it.

This chapter will look in brief overview at the core technologies that go together to make the World Wide Web.</p>\n<p>We can start by differentiating the Internet and the World Wide Web. These are often confused because the Web is the main use that most people have for the Internet and a common web browser is called \"Internet Explorer\". However, we can properly distinguish between them. The Internet is a collection of inter-connected computers using the TCP/IP protocol to exchange information. The World Wide Web is a particular use of the Internet to exchange HTML web pages (and other documents) using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>\n<p>Let's look briefly at the four basic ingredients of the Web:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TCP/IP - is a low level message protocol that is used to transfer messages between computers on the Internet.</li>\n<li>HTTP - is used by a Web Client to make a request to a Web Server and for the server to return the response.</li>\n<li>URL - is a way of writing down the address of something on the Web so that a browser can work out where to get it from.</li>\n<li>HTML - is a language for writing web pages containing text, images and other content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, these four technologies allow a web client - the web browser on your computer - to fetch pages from a web server anywhere in the world that might contain links to other documents and so on. It's the links between documents that make this a <em>Web</em> and the Internet that allows it to be the <em>World Wide Web</em>.</p>\n<p>Let's look at each of these technologies in a little more detail; although we'll explore most of them a lot more throughout the rest of this book.</p>\n<h2>TCP/IP and DNS</h2>\n<p>TCP/IP, the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is the standard way of exchanging messages on the Internet - in fact it effectively defines what the Internet is: a network of computers communicating via TCP/IP. For our purposes, there's no need to have a deep understanding of the low level details of TCP/IP, though many of you will learn more about it if you study any networking topics. However there are a few higher level things that touch on how we use the Internet in the context of the World Wide Web.</p>\n<p>A <em>Protocol</em> in this sense is a formal standard for how two machines will talk to each other over a communications channel. It describes what messages are allowed and what they mean and how data is transferred over the network. Later, we'll look at HTTP which is a higher level protocol for web requests. TCP/IP deals with the low level exchange of data and doesn't really care what the content of that data is.</p>\n<p>The Internet is a collection of computer networks joined by physical network channels. Within an organisation, there may be a physical network based on the Ethernet standard (wired or wireless) which effectively connects all computers on the network to each other. Organisations connect to each other via DSL or cable connections. These <em>inter</em>-connected <em>net</em>works make up the Internet. The role of TCP/IP is to allow a computer within one organisation (your laptop) to establish a connection to a computer in another (a web server). Importantly, this connection is a <em>point-to-point</em> connection - like a private channel between the two computers, even though the data is carried by this shared network of networks.</p>\n<p>TCP/IP is a <em>packet oriented</em> protocol. To send a message, it is broken up into small chunks (packets) which are each addressed and sent over the network. The receiving computer intercepts these packets, notices that they are addressed to them, and re-assembles the original message. Packets can arrive out of order (or not at all) and TCP/IP defines what the two communicating computers should do in this case.</p>\n<p>Each computer on the network is assigned a unique <em>IP address</em> which is a 32 bit number usually expressed as four 8 bit digits separated by dots. For example 192.168.1.2 or 137.111.158.22. These numbers are used as the addresses of the packets sent around the Internet. Within an organisation, all computers will share the first part of their address; for example, all Macquarie University computers will have addresses starting with 137.111. This means that any packet sent from within Macquarie to an address in the range 137.111.x.x will find it's destination somewhere inside the organisation. However, if we send a packet to 143.119.160.16 (the NSW Government website) the network protocols need to know that this packet should be forwarded to the NSW Government network before it can be delivered. We can pretend that this all happens by magic (this isn't a networking course) and rest assured that a clever <em>network routing</em> algorithm will get the packets to where they need to go. As long as we know the IP address of the destination computer, we can establish a point-to-point channel and send data back and forth.</p>\n<p>Within your home you might have your own private network, often established by a wireless router that connects to your ADSL or cable service. While this router will have a proper IP address, the network it establishes in your home is a <em>private network</em> and will use one of two address ranges: 192.168.x.x or 10.10.x.x. Both of these are reserved for private use, so that my laptop and your printer might have the same IP address of 192.168.100.13. A trick called Network Address Translation (NAT) carried out by your router allows each of these devices to connect to the Internet through the router, even though they don't have a full IP address. Again, we don't need to worry about the details but sometimes it's useful to know how to communicate directly with devices on your own network, in which case you might start finding out about these private IP addresses.</p>\n<p>A significant issue with the success and ubiquity of the Internet is that we might run out of unique addresses. Since an IP address is a 32 bit number, that means there are only 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. If every computer, mobile phone, printer and electricity meter is to be connected to the Internet, the it's clear that more addresses will be needed. There are two responses to this. The first is that many of these devices share a single IP address (using NAT) which multiplies the number available significantly. THe second is a new standard called IPv6 (rather than IPv4 which I've described here) where addresses are 128 bits long. Most modern devices are able to use IPv6 addressing so the crisis is unlikely to hit us catastrophically.</p>\n<p>IP addresses give a unique identifier for each device but they aren't very easy to remember. We're used to giving the names of web-sites via names like www.nsw.gov.au or sales.example.com. These names are translated into numerical IP addresses via the Domain Name System (DNS) which works using a clever hierarchical algorithm. For example, to work out what sales.example.com means our local DNS server would look at the last part of the address and forward the query to a server that it knows is authoritative for all addresses ending in .com. The .com server may not know which IP address corresponds to sales.example.com so it sends the query on to the DNS server for example.com which will respond with the answer. As the result is passed back to the original DNS server, it is cached (remembered) so that it can be returned more quickly the next time it is requested.</p>\n<p>DNS allows an organisation to set up whatever names it needs and link those names to its servers. It's common to have the main web server called www.example.com but the same server could also be referred to as example.com, sales.example.com or test.example.com. We'll see later how this arrangement can be used to provide a lot of flexibility when setting up web servers.</p>\n<h2>HTTP</h2>\n<p>In 1991 Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. He was building on the existing technology of the Internet that allowed computers to exchange information around the world. His invention consisted essentially of three things: the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the Universal Resource Locator (URL) and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTTP is the language that a web client (your browser) talks to a web server to ask for a page and get the response back. It's a protocol, just like TCP/IP, but it's a much higher level protocol and it's one that we need to understand very well as web programmers.</p>\n<p>HTTP requires that we first establish a point-to-point connection between a client (who is sending a request) and a server (who will fulfil the request if possible). This connection is usually via TCP/IP over the Internet but could also be over any other communication medium such as <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/bt-http-server/\">bluetooth</a>. Once the connection is established, the conversation can begin.</p>\n<p>One of the important features of HTTP is that it is a simple, text based protocol. The request and response consist of a number of lines of text in a well defined format. Here is an example request that might be sent to a server:</p>\n<p>The first word in the request is always one of the defined <em>HTTP verbs</em> (most frequently GET, HEAD or POST, we'll explore these in more detail later). A GET request asks the server to return the given resource, in this case '/storefront.html' which is probably an HTML file stored somewhere on the server. The last part of the first line (HTTP/1.1) defines the version of the standard that we are using; there was a version 1.0 but most modern browsers will use 1.1. The remaining lines of the request include other <em>headers</em> that qualify the request in some way. The <em>Host</em> header is required and denotes the server that the request is being sent to. The Accept header defines what kinds of document we'd like in return; in this case, any kind of text document is ok. The request ends with a blank line, which is how the server knows that all headers have been received.</p>\n<p>The request is received and processed by the server and a response is sent back to the client containing the web page that was asked for. Again the format of the response is easy to understand:</p>\n<p>The first word of the response must be HTTP/1.1, the remainder of the first line contains a response code (200) and explanation (OK) in this case saying everything is fine, here's the page you asked for. The second header here defines the type of document being returned (it's an HTML page). There is then a blank line which ends the headers (as with the request) and the HTML content is then sent.</p>\n<p>A real request and response pair will have many more headers than this but their format follows this basic pattern: header lines followed by a blank line and an optional body. The point here is that HTTP is a very simple conversation between web client and server.</p>\n<p>One important feature of HTTP is that each request/response pair is independent of every other. This means that all the information about your request must be included in the request headers; the server doesn't remember anything you told it last time. This is one reason that HTTP and the web have been so successful. It is very easy to implement an HTTP server and it can be done on very small devices. This might be one of the reasons why the Web succeeded where other similar systems failed. Since the protocol is so simple, it was easy to write a web server and many people did. This meant that the web was used by many small groups to publish content, forming the groundswell that led to institutional and corporate adoption.</p>\n<p>We'll look at HTTP in more detail later, for now the take home message is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP is a simple text based protocol</li>\n<li>The client (browser) sends a request to the server</li>\n<li>The server receives the request and returns a response</li>\n<li>The server doesn't need to remember the client - every request is independant.</li>\n<li>The simple nature of HTTP makes it easy to understand and makes writing web servers relatively easy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Uniform Resource Locators: URL</h2>\n<p>Another part of Tim Berners-Lee's invention is the Uniform Resource Locator, URL. These days, URLs are ubiquitous. We see them on advertisments, on the TV, we send them to each other in email, even reference them in books and reports. Most organisations today will have at least one top-level URL for their website and often have many connected to particular services, departments or advertising campaigns.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://pwp.stevecassidy.net/web/urls.html\">the URL chapter</a> for a detaile discussion.</p>\n<h2>Hypertext Markup Language: HTML</h2>\n<p>HTML is the last link in the chain that makes the Web. It is a language that allows authors to write Hypertext documents that include structure and formatting instructions. <em>Hypertext</em> describes the idea of linking one document to another via <em>hyperlinks</em> so that when you activate a link, you jump to a new document. There were hypertext systems before the birth of the web (<a href=\"http://www.xanadu.com/\">Project Xanadu</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard\">Hypercard</a>) but HTML has been much more successful than any other standard in this space.</p>\n<p>HTML is a <em>Markup Language</em> which means that it provides a way of adding additional information or markup to plain text. In this case, the markup defines the structure of the document - headers, paragraphs, lists, tables - as well as the hypertext features - links and anchors. There are other markup languages, for example LaTeX is used to write scientific papers by adding markup to text (e.g. \\textbf{bold text} or \\section{A heading}). All markup languages have some way of differentiating the text in a document from the markup instructions. In HTML this is via the angle brackets which surround tag names: &#x3C;tag>.</p>\n<p>HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee but it derives from an earlier standard called SGML (Standard Generalised Markup Language) that had been in use for some years as a language for writing technical documentation. It came out of work by IBM on their technical documentation and became an industry standard ratified by the ISO. SGML is in fact a meta-standard in that it defines a way of defining a markup language. HTML is one such markup language and can strictly be treated as such; however, since HTML is so much more common than any other SGML language, it is usually treated as a special case. So, for example, while we could use general purpose SGML authoring tools to write HTML, we generally use applications tailored to writing web pages that only understand HTML.</p>\n<p>Another related markup language is <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/\">XML</a>, the eXtensible Markup Language. XML began as an attempt to streamline the SGML standard to make it more suitable for the web. Like SGML, XML is a meta-standard that defines how markup languages can be written. There is a version of HTML defined as an XML language called <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/\">XHTML</a> but this never really took off and the standardisation work around it was stopped in 2010. Instead, XML has become widely used to describe <em>data</em> rather than <em>documents</em> and we'll look at how it is used today on the web later in this book.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/http/","relativePath":"docs/articles/http.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"http.md","name":"http","frontmatter":{"title":"The HTTP Protocol","weight":0,"excerpt":"The HTTP Protocol","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>The HTTP Protocol\n\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires: a connection between client and server</li>\n<li>Stateless: no login process, each request is independent</li>\n<li>Simple format: request header, blank line, possible payload</li>\n<li>Symmetrical: allows data to be sent and recieved</li>\n<li>Very easy to implement but scales very well</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Example HTTP Request</h2>\n<p>Note lines folded for display.</p>\n<p>What do each of these headers mean?

Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at <a href=\"http://google.stanford.edu/\">http://google.stanford.edu/</a><br>\nTo engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date.<br>\nApart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.</p>\n<p> <strong>Keywords</strong>: World Wide Web, Search Engines, Information Retrieval, PageRank, Google</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>1. Introduction</h2>\n<p><em>(Note: There are two versions of this paper -- a longer full version and a shorter printed version. The full version is available on the web and the conference CD-ROM.)</em><br>\nThe web creates new challenges for information retrieval. The amount of information on the web is growing rapidly, as well as the number of new users inexperienced in the art of web research. People are likely to surf the web using its link graph, often starting with high quality human maintained indices such as <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!</a> or with search engines. Human maintained lists cover popular topics effectively but are subjective, expensive to build and maintain, slow to improve, and cannot cover all esoteric topics. Automated search engines that rely on keyword matching usually return too many low quality matches. To make matters worse, some advertisers attempt to gain people's attention by taking measures meant to mislead automated search engines. We have built a large-scale search engine which addresses many of the problems of existing systems. It makes especially heavy use of the additional structure present in hypertext to provide much higher quality search results. We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100 and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.</p>\n<h3>1.1 Web Search Engines -- Scaling Up: 1994 - 2000</h3>\n<p>Search engine technology has had to scale dramatically to keep up with the growth of the web. In 1994, one of the first web search engines, the World Wide Web Worm (WWWW) <a href=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/mypapers/www94.ps\">[McBryan 94]</a> had an index of 110,000 web pages and web accessible documents. As of November, 1997, the top search engines claim to index from 2 million (WebCrawler) to 100 million web documents (from <a href=\"http://www.searchenginewatch.com/\">Search Engine Watch)</a>. It is foreseeable that by the year 2000, a comprehensive index of the Web will contain over a billion documents. At the same time, the number of queries search engines handle has grown incredibly too. In March and April 1994, the World Wide Web Worm received an average of about 1500 queries per day. In November 1997, Altavista claimed it handled roughly 20 million queries per day. With the increasing number of users on the web, and automated systems which query search engines, it is likely that top search engines will handle hundreds of millions of queries per day by the year 2000. The goal of our system is to address many of the problems, both in quality and scalability, introduced by scaling search engine technology to such extraordinary numbers.</p>\n<h3>1.2. Google: Scaling with the Web</h3>\n<p>Creating a search engine which scales even to today's web presents many challenges. Fast crawling technology is needed to gather the web documents and keep them up to date. Storage space must be used efficiently to store indices and, optionally, the documents themselves. The indexing system must process hundreds of gigabytes of data efficiently. Queries must be handled quickly, at a rate of hundreds to thousands per second.</p>\n<p>These tasks are becoming increasingly difficult as the Web grows. However, hardware performance and cost have improved dramatically to partially offset the difficulty. There are, however, several notable exceptions to this progress such as disk seek time and operating system robustness. In designing Google, we have considered both the rate of growth of the Web and technological changes. Google is designed to scale well to extremely large data sets. It makes efficient use of storage space to store the index. Its data structures are optimized for fast and efficient access (see section <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#data\">4.2</a>). Further, we expect that the cost to index and store text or HTML will eventually decline relative to the amount that will be available (see <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#b\">Appendix B</a>). This will result in favorable scaling properties for centralized systems like Google.</p>\n<h3>1.3 Design Goals</h3>\n<h4>1.3.1 Improved Search Quality</h4>\n<p>Our main goal is to improve the quality of web search engines. In 1994, some people believed that a complete search index would make it possible to find anything easily. According to <a href=\"http://botw.org/1994/awards/navigators.html\">Best of the Web 1994 -- Navigators,</a>  \"The best navigation service should make it easy to find almost anything on the Web (once all the data is entered).\"  However, the Web of 1997 is quite different. Anyone who has used a search engine recently, can readily testify that the completeness of the index is not the only factor in the quality of search results. \"Junk results\" often wash out any results that a user is interested in. In fact, as of November 1997, only one of the top four commercial search engines finds itself (returns its own search page in response to its name in the top ten results). One of the main causes of this problem is that the number of documents in the indices has been increasing by many orders of magnitude, but the user's ability to look at documents has not. People are still only willing to look at the first few tens of results. Because of this, as the collection size grows, we need tools that have very high precision (number of relevant documents returned, say in the top tens of results). Indeed, we want our notion of \"relevant\" to only include the very best documents since there may be tens of thousands of slightly relevant documents. This very high precision is important even at the expense of recall (the total number of relevant documents the system is able to return). There is quite a bit of recent optimism that the use of more hypertextual information can help improve search and other applications [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Marchiori 97</a>] [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Spertus 97</a>] [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Weiss 96</a>] [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Kleinberg 98</a>]. In particular, link structure [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Page 98</a>] and link text provide a lot of information for making relevance judgments and quality filtering. Google makes use of both link structure and anchor text (see Sections <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#pr\">2.1</a> and <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#anchor\">2.2</a>).</p>\n<h4>1.3.2 Academic Search Engine Research</h4>\n<p>Aside from tremendous growth, the Web has also become increasingly commercial over time. In 1993, 1.5% of web servers were on .com domains. This number grew to over 60% in 1997. At the same time, search engines have migrated from the academic domain to the commercial. Up until now most search engine development has gone on at companies with little publication of technical details. This causes search engine technology to remain largely a black art and to be advertising oriented (see <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#a\">Appendix A</a>). With Google, we have a strong goal to push more development and understanding into the academic realm.</p>\n<p>Another important design goal was to build systems that reasonable numbers of people can actually use. Usage was important to us because we think some of the most interesting research will involve leveraging the vast amount of usage data that is available from modern web systems. For example, there are many tens of millions of searches performed every day. However, it is very difficult to get this data, mainly because it is considered commercially valuable.</p>\n<p>Our final design goal was to build an architecture that can support novel research activities on large-scale web data. To support novel research uses, Google stores all of the actual documents it crawls in compressed form. One of our main goals in designing Google was to set up an environment where other researchers can come in quickly, process large chunks of the web, and produce interesting results that would have been very difficult to produce otherwise. In the short time the system has been up, there have already been several papers using databases generated by Google, and many others are underway. Another goal we have is to set up a Spacelab-like environment where researchers or even students can propose and do interesting experiments on our large-scale web data.</p>\n<h2>2. System Features</h2>\n<p>The Google search engine has two important features that help it produce high precision results. First, it makes use of the link structure of the Web to calculate a quality ranking for each web page. This ranking is called PageRank and is described in detail in [Page 98]. Second, Google utilizes link to improve search results.</p>\n<h3>2.1 PageRank: Bringing Order to the Web</h3>\n<p>The citation (link) graph of the web is an important resource that has largely gone unused in existing web search engines. We have created maps containing as many as 518 million of these hyperlinks, a significant sample of the total. These maps allow rapid calculation of a web page's \"PageRank\", an objective measure of its citation importance that corresponds well with people's subjective idea of importance. Because of this correspondence, PageRank is an excellent way to prioritize the results of web keyword searches. For most popular subjects, a simple text matching search that is restricted to web page titles performs admirably when PageRank prioritizes the results (demo available at <a href=\"http://google.stanford.edu/\">google.stanford.edu</a>). For the type of full text searches in the main Google system, PageRank also helps a great deal.</p>\n<h4>2.1.1 Description of PageRank Calculation</h4>\n<p>Academic citation literature has been applied to the web, largely by counting citations or backlinks to a given page. This gives some approximation of a page's importance or quality. PageRank extends this idea by not counting links from all pages equally, and by normalizing by the number of links on a page. PageRank is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We assume page A has pages T1...Tn which point to it (i.e., are citations). The parameter d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1. We usually set d to 0.85. There are more details about d in the next section. Also C(A) is defined as the number of links going out of page A. The PageRank of a page A is given as follows:</em></p>\n<p><em>PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))</em></p>\n<p><em>Note that the PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages, so the sum of all web pages' PageRanks will be one.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>PageRank or <em>PR(A)</em> can be calculated using a simple iterative algorithm, and corresponds to the principal eigenvector of the normalized link matrix of the web. Also, a PageRank for 26 million web pages can be computed in a few hours on a medium size workstation. There are many other details which are beyond the scope of this paper.</p>\n<h4>2.1.2 Intuitive Justification</h4>\n<p>PageRank can be thought of as a model of user behavior. We assume there is a \"random surfer\" who is given a web page at random and keeps clicking on links, never hitting \"back\" but eventually gets bored and starts on another random page. The probability that the random surfer visits a page is its PageRank. And, the <em>d</em> damping factor is the probability at each page the \"random surfer\" will get bored and request another random page. One important variation is to only add the damping factor <em>d</em> to a single page, or a group of pages. This allows for personalization and can make it nearly impossible to deliberately mislead the system in order to get a higher ranking. We have several other extensions to PageRank, again see [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Page 98</a>].</p>\n<p>Another intuitive justification is that a page can have a high PageRank if there are many pages that point to it, or if there are some pages that point to it and have a high PageRank. Intuitively, pages that are well cited from many places around the web are worth looking at. Also, pages that have perhaps only one citation from something like the <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com/\">Yahoo!</a> homepage are also generally worth looking at. If a page was not high quality, or was a broken link, it is quite likely that Yahoo's homepage would not link to it. PageRank handles both these cases and everything in between by recursively propagating weights through the link structure of the web.</p>\n<h3>2.2 Anchor Text</h3>\n<p>The text of links is treated in a special way in our search engine. Most search engines associate the text of a link with the page that the link is on. In addition, we associate it with the page the link points to. This has several advantages. First, anchors often provide more accurate descriptions of web pages than the pages themselves. Second, anchors may exist for documents which cannot be indexed by a text-based search engine, such as images, programs, and databases. This makes it possible to return web pages which have not actually been crawled. Note that pages that have not been crawled can cause problems, since they are never checked for validity before being returned to the user. In this case, the search engine can even return a page that never actually existed, but had hyperlinks pointing to it. However, it is possible to sort the results, so that this particular problem rarely happens.</p>\n<p>This idea of propagating anchor text to the page it refers to was implemented in the World Wide Web Worm [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">McBryan 94</a>] especially because it helps search non-text information, and expands the search coverage with fewer downloaded documents. We use anchor propagation mostly because anchor text can help provide better quality results. Using anchor text efficiently is technically difficult because of the large amounts of data which must be processed. In our current crawl of 24 million pages, we had over 259 million anchors which we indexed.</p>\n<h3>2.3 Other Features</h3>\n<p>Aside from PageRank and the use of anchor text, Google has several other features. First, it has location information for all hits and so it makes extensive use of proximity in search. Second, Google keeps track of some visual presentation details such as font size of words. Words in a larger or bolder font are weighted higher than other words. Third, full raw HTML of pages is available in a repository.</p>\n<h2>3 Related Work</h2>\n<p>Search research on the web has a short and concise history. The World Wide Web Worm (WWWW) <a href=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/mypapers/www94.ps\">[McBryan 94]</a> was one of the first web search engines. It was subsequently followed by several other academic search engines, many of which are now public companies. Compared to the growth of the Web and the importance of search engines there are precious few documents about recent search engines [<a href=\"http://info.webcrawler.com/bp/WWW94.html\">Pinkerton 94</a>]. According to Michael Mauldin (chief scientist, Lycos Inc) <a href=\"http://www.computer.org/pubs/expert/1997/trends/x1008/mauldin.htm\">[Mauldin]</a>, \"the various services (including Lycos) closely guard the details of these databases\". However, there has been a fair amount of work on specific features of search engines. Especially well represented is work which can get results by post-processing the results of existing commercial search engines, or produce small scale \"individualized\" search engines. Finally, there has been a lot of research on information retrieval systems, especially on well controlled collections. In the next two sections, we discuss some areas where this research needs to be extended to work better on the web.</p>\n<h3>3.1 Information Retrieval</h3>\n<p>Work in information retrieval systems goes back many years and is well developed [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Witten 94</a>]. However, most of the research on information retrieval systems is on small well controlled homogeneous collections such as collections of scientific papers or news stories on a related topic. Indeed, the primary benchmark for information retrieval, the Text Retrieval Conference [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">TREC 96</a>], uses a fairly small, well controlled collection for their benchmarks. The \"Very Large Corpus\" benchmark is only 20GB compared to the 147GB from our crawl of 24 million web pages. Things that work well on TREC often do not produce good results on the web. For example, the standard vector space model tries to return the document that most closely approximates the query, given that both query and document are vectors defined by their word occurrence. On the web, this strategy often returns very short documents that are the query plus a few words. For example, we have seen a major search engine return a page containing only \"Bill Clinton Sucks\" and picture from a \"Bill Clinton\" query. Some argue that on the web, users should specify more accurately what they want and add more words to their query. We disagree vehemently with this position. If a user issues a query like \"Bill Clinton\" they should get reasonable results since there is a enormous amount of high quality information available on this topic. Given examples like these, we believe that the standard information retrieval work needs to be extended to deal effectively with the web.</p>\n<h3>3.2 Differences Between the Web and Well Controlled Collections</h3>\n<p>The web is a vast collection of completely uncontrolled heterogeneous documents. Documents on the web have extreme variation internal to the documents, and also in the external meta information that might be available. For example, documents differ internally in their language (both human and programming), vocabulary (email addresses, links, zip codes, phone numbers, product numbers), type or format (text, HTML, PDF, images, sounds), and may even be machine generated (log files or output from a database). On the other hand, we define external meta information as information that can be inferred about a document, but is not contained within it. Examples of external meta information include things like reputation of the source, update frequency, quality, popularity or usage, and citations. Not only are the possible sources of external meta information varied, but the things that are being measured vary many orders of magnitude as well. For example, compare the usage information from a major homepage, like Yahoo's which currently receives millions of page views every day with an obscure historical article which might receive one view every ten years. Clearly, these two items must be treated very differently by a search engine.</p>\n<p>Another big difference between the web and traditional well controlled collections is that there is virtually no control over what people can put on the web. Couple this flexibility to publish anything with the enormous influence of search engines to route traffic and companies which deliberately manipulating search engines for profit become a serious problem. This problem that has not been addressed in traditional closed information retrieval systems. Also, it is interesting to note that metadata efforts have largely failed with web search engines, because any text on the page which is not directly represented to the user is abused to manipulate search engines. There are even numerous companies which specialize in manipulating search engines for profit.</p>\n<h2>4 System Anatomy</h2>\n<p>First, we will provide a high level discussion of the architecture. Then, there is some in-depth descriptions of important data structures. Finally, the major applications: crawling, indexing, and searching will be examined in depth.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/over.gif\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1. High Level Google Architecture</p>\n<h3>4.1 Google Architecture Overview</h3>\n<p>In this section, we will give a high level overview of how the whole system works as pictured in Figure 1. Further sections will discuss the applications and data structures not mentioned in this section. Most of Google is implemented in C or C++ for efficiency and can run in either Solaris or Linux.</p>\n<p>In Google, the web crawling (downloading of web pages) is done by several distributed crawlers. There is a URLserver that sends lists of URLs to be fetched to the crawlers. The web pages that are fetched are then sent to the storeserver. The storeserver then compresses and stores the web pages into a repository. Every web page has an associated ID number called a docID which is assigned whenever a new URL is parsed out of a web page. The indexing function is performed by the indexer and the sorter. The indexer performs a number of functions. It reads the repository, uncompresses the documents, and parses them. Each document is converted into a set of word occurrences called hits. The hits record the word, position in document, an approximation of font size, and capitalization. The indexer distributes these hits into a set of \"barrels\", creating a partially sorted forward index. The indexer performs another important function. It parses out all the links in every web page and stores important information about them in an anchors file. This file contains enough information to determine where each link points from and to, and the text of the link.</p>\n<p>The URLresolver reads the anchors file and converts relative URLs into absolute URLs and in turn into docIDs. It puts the anchor text into the forward index, associated with the docID that the anchor points to. It also generates a database of links which are pairs of docIDs. The links database is used to compute PageRanks for all the documents.</p>\n<p>The sorter takes the barrels, which are sorted by docID (this is a simplification, see <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#hits\">Section 4.2.5</a>), and resorts them by wordID to generate the inverted index. This is done in place so that little temporary space is needed for this operation. The sorter also produces a list of wordIDs and offsets into the inverted index. A program called DumpLexicon takes this list together with the lexicon produced by the indexer and generates a new lexicon to be used by the searcher. The searcher is run by a web server and uses the lexicon built by DumpLexicon together with the inverted index and the PageRanks to answer queries.</p>\n<h3>4.2 Major Data Structures</h3>\n<p>Google's data structures are optimized so that a large document collection can be crawled, indexed, and searched with little cost. Although, CPUs and bulk input output rates have improved dramatically over the years, a disk seek still requires about 10 ms to complete. Google is designed to avoid disk seeks whenever possible, and this has had a considerable influence on the design of the data structures.</p>\n<h4>4.2.1 BigFiles</h4>\n<p>BigFiles are virtual files spanning multiple file systems and are addressable by 64 bit integers. The allocation among multiple file systems is handled automatically. The BigFiles package also handles allocation and deallocation of file descriptors, since the operating systems do not provide enough for our needs. BigFiles also support rudimentary compression options.</p>\n<h4>4.2.2 Repository</h4>\n<p><img src=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/repos.gif\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2. Repository Data Structure</p>\n<p>The repository contains the full HTML of every web page. Each page is compressed using zlib (see <a href=\"ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html\">RFC1950</a>). The choice of compression technique is a tradeoff between speed and compression ratio. We chose zlib's speed over a significant improvement in compression offered by <a href=\"http://www.muraroa.demon.co.uk/\">bzip</a>. The compression rate of bzip was approximately 4 to 1 on the repository as compared to zlib's 3 to 1 compression. In the repository, the documents are stored one after the other and are prefixed by docID, length, and URL as can be seen in Figure 2. The repository requires no other data structures to be used in order to access it. This helps with data consistency and makes development much easier; we can rebuild all the other data structures from only the repository and a file which lists crawler errors.</p>\n<h4>4.2.3 Document Index</h4>\n<p>The document index keeps information about each document. It is a fixed width ISAM (Index sequential access mode) index, ordered by docID. The information stored in each entry includes the current document status, a pointer into the repository, a document checksum, and various statistics. If the document has been crawled, it also contains a pointer into a variable width file called docinfo which contains its URL and title. Otherwise the pointer points into the URLlist which contains just the URL. This design decision was driven by the desire to have a reasonably compact data structure, and the ability to fetch a record in one disk seek during a search</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is a file which is used to convert URLs into docIDs. It is a list of URL checksums with their corresponding docIDs and is sorted by checksum. In order to find the docID of a particular URL, the URL's checksum is computed and a binary search is performed on the checksums file to find its docID. URLs may be converted into docIDs in batch by doing a merge with this file. This is the technique the URLresolver uses to turn URLs into docIDs. This batch mode of update is crucial because otherwise we must perform one seek for every link which assuming one disk would take more than a month for our 322 million link dataset.</p>\n<h4>4.2.4 Lexicon</h4>\n<p>The lexicon has several different forms. One important change from earlier systems is that the lexicon can fit in memory for a reasonable price. In the current implementation we can keep the lexicon in memory on a machine with 256 MB of main memory. The current lexicon contains 14 million words (though some rare words were not added to the lexicon). It is implemented in two parts -- a list of the words (concatenated together but separated by nulls) and a hash table of pointers. For various functions, the list of words has some auxiliary information which is beyond the scope of this paper to explain fully.</p>\n<h4>4.2.5 Hit Lists</h4>\n<p>A hit list corresponds to a list of occurrences of a particular word in a particular document including position, font, and capitalization information. Hit lists account for most of the space used in both the forward and the inverted indices. Because of this, it is important to represent them as efficiently as possible. We considered several alternatives for encoding position, font, and capitalization -- simple encoding (a triple of integers), a compact encoding (a hand optimized allocation of bits), and Huffman coding. In the end we chose a hand optimized compact encoding since it required far less space than the simple encoding and far less bit manipulation than Huffman coding. The details of the hits are shown in Figure 3.</p>\n<p>Our compact encoding uses two bytes for every hit. There are two types of hits: fancy hits and plain hits. Fancy hits include hits occurring in a URL, title, anchor text, or meta tag. Plain hits include everything else. A plain hit consists of a capitalization bit, font size, and 12 bits of word position in a document (all positions higher than 4095 are labeled 4096). Font size is represented relative to the rest of the document using three bits (only 7 values are actually used because 111 is the flag that signals a fancy hit). A fancy hit consists of a capitalization bit, the font size set to 7 to indicate it is a fancy hit, 4 bits to encode the type of fancy hit, and 8 bits of position. For anchor hits, the 8 bits of position are split into 4 bits for position in anchor and 4 bits for a hash of the docID the anchor occurs in. This gives us some limited phrase searching as long as there are not that many anchors for a particular word. We expect to update the way that anchor hits are stored to allow for greater resolution in the position and docIDhash fields. We use font size relative to the rest of the document because when searching, you do not want to rank otherwise identical documents differently just because one of the documents is in a larger font.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/barrels.gif\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3. Forward and Reverse Indexes and the Lexicon</p>\n<p>The length of a hit list is stored before the hits themselves. To save space, the length of the hit list is combined with the wordID in the forward index and the docID in the inverted index. This limits it to 8 and 5 bits respectively (there are some tricks which allow 8 bits to be borrowed from the wordID). If the length is longer than would fit in that many bits, an escape code is used in those bits, and the next two bytes contain the actual length.</p>\n<h4>4.2.6 Forward Index</h4>\n<p>The forward index is actually already partially sorted. It is stored in a number of barrels (we used 64). Each barrel holds a range of wordID's. If a document contains words that fall into a particular barrel, the docID is recorded into the barrel, followed by a list of wordID's with hitlists which correspond to those words. This scheme requires slightly more storage because of duplicated docIDs but the difference is very small for a reasonable number of buckets and saves considerable time and coding complexity in the final indexing phase done by the sorter. Furthermore, instead of storing actual wordID's, we store each wordID as a relative difference from the minimum wordID that falls into the barrel the wordID is in. This way, we can use just 24 bits for the wordID's in the unsorted barrels, leaving 8 bits for the hit list length.</p>\n<h4>4.2.7 Inverted Index</h4>\n<p>The inverted index consists of the same barrels as the forward index, except that they have been processed by the sorter. For every valid wordID, the lexicon contains a pointer into the barrel that wordID falls into. It points to a doclist of docID's together with their corresponding hit lists. This doclist represents all the occurrences of that word in all documents.</p>\n<p>An important issue is in what order the docID's should appear in the doclist. One simple solution is to store them sorted by docID. This allows for quick merging of different doclists for multiple word queries. Another option is to store them sorted by a ranking of the occurrence of the word in each document. This makes answering one word queries trivial and makes it likely that the answers to multiple word queries are near the start. However, merging is much more difficult. Also, this makes development much more difficult in that a change to the ranking function requires a rebuild of the index. We chose a compromise between these options, keeping two sets of inverted barrels -- one set for hit lists which include title or anchor hits and another set for all hit lists. This way, we check the first set of barrels first and if there are not enough matches within those barrels we check the larger ones.</p>\n<h3>4.3 Crawling the Web</h3>\n<p>Running a web crawler is a challenging task. There are tricky performance and reliability issues and even more importantly, there are social issues. Crawling is the most fragile application since it involves interacting with hundreds of thousands of web servers and various name servers which are all beyond the control of the system.</p>\n<p>In order to scale to hundreds of millions of web pages, Google has a fast distributed crawling system. A single URLserver serves lists of URLs to a number of crawlers (we typically ran about 3). Both the URLserver and the crawlers are implemented in Python. Each crawler keeps roughly 300 connections open at once. This is necessary to retrieve web pages at a fast enough pace. At peak speeds, the system can crawl over 100 web pages per second using four crawlers. This amounts to roughly 600K per second of data. A major performance stress is DNS lookup. Each crawler maintains a its own DNS cache so it does not need to do a DNS lookup before crawling each document. Each of the hundreds of connections can be in a number of different states: looking up DNS, connecting to host, sending request, and receiving response. These factors make the crawler a complex component of the system. It uses asynchronous IO to manage events, and a number of queues to move page fetches from state to state.</p>\n<p>It turns out that running a crawler which connects to more than half a million servers, and generates tens of millions of log entries generates a fair amount of email and phone calls. Because of the vast number of people coming on line, there are always those who do not know what a crawler is, because this is the first one they have seen. Almost daily, we receive an email something like, \"Wow, you looked at a lot of pages from my web site. How did you like it?\" There are also some people who do not know about the <a href=\"http://info.webcrawler.com/mak/projects/robots/norobots.html\">robots exclusion protocol</a>, and think their page should be protected from indexing by a statement like, \"This page is copyrighted and should not be indexed\", which needless to say is difficult for web crawlers to understand. Also, because of the huge amount of data involved, unexpected things will happen. For example, our system tried to crawl an online game. This resulted in lots of garbage messages in the middle of their game! It turns out this was an easy problem to fix. But this problem had not come up until we had downloaded tens of millions of pages. Because of the immense variation in web pages and servers, it is virtually impossible to test a crawler without running it on large part of the Internet. Invariably, there are hundreds of obscure problems which may only occur on one page out of the whole web and cause the crawler to crash, or worse, cause unpredictable or incorrect behavior. Systems which access large parts of the Internet need to be designed to be very robust and carefully tested. Since large complex systems such as crawlers will invariably cause problems, there needs to be significant resources devoted to reading the email and solving these problems as they come up.</p>\n<h3>4.4 Indexing the Web</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Parsing --</strong> Any parser which is designed to run on the entire Web must handle a huge array of possible errors. These range from typos in HTML tags to kilobytes of zeros in the middle of a tag, non-ASCII characters, HTML tags nested hundreds deep, and a great variety of other errors that challenge anyone's imagination to come up with equally creative ones. For maximum speed, instead of using YACC to generate a CFG parser, we use flex to generate a lexical analyzer which we outfit with its own stack. Developing this parser which runs at a reasonable speed and is very robust involved a fair amount of work.</li>\n<li><strong>Indexing</strong> <strong>Documents into Barrels --</strong> After each document is parsed, it is encoded into a number of barrels. Every word is converted into a wordID by using an in-memory hash table -- the lexicon. New additions to the lexicon hash table are logged to a file. Once the words are converted into wordID's, their occurrences in the current document are translated into hit lists and are written into the forward barrels. The main difficulty with parallelization of the indexing phase is that the lexicon needs to be shared. Instead of sharing the lexicon, we took the approach of writing a log of all the extra words that were not in a base lexicon, which we fixed at 14 million words. That way multiple indexers can run in parallel and then the small log file of extra words can be processed by one final indexer.</li>\n<li><strong>Sorting</strong> -- In order to generate the inverted index, the sorter takes each of the forward barrels and sorts it by wordID to produce an inverted barrel for title and anchor hits and a full text inverted barrel. This process happens one barrel at a time, thus requiring little temporary storage. Also, we parallelize the sorting phase to use as many machines as we have simply by running multiple sorters, which can process different buckets at the same time. Since the barrels don't fit into main memory, the sorter further subdivides them into baskets which do fit into memory based on wordID and docID. Then the sorter, loads each basket into memory, sorts it and writes its contents into the short inverted barrel and the full inverted barrel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4.5 Searching</h3>\n<p>The goal of searching is to provide quality search results efficiently. Many of the large commercial search engines seemed to have made great progress in terms of efficiency. Therefore, we have focused more on quality of search in our research, although we believe our solutions are scalable to commercial volumes with a bit more effort. The google query evaluation process is show in Figure 4.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Parse the query.</li>\n<li>Convert words into wordIDs.</li>\n<li>Seek to the start of the doclist in the short barrel for every word.</li>\n<li>Scan through the doclists until there is a document that matches all the search terms.</li>\n<li>Compute the rank of that document for the query.</li>\n<li>If we are in the short barrels and at the end of any doclist, seek to the start of the doclist in the full barrel for every word and go to step 4.</li>\n<li>If we are not at the end of any doclist go to step 4.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sort the documents that have matched by rank and return the top k.</p>\n<p>Figure 4. Google Query Evaluation</p>\n<p>To put a limit on response time, once a certain number (currently 40,000) of matching documents are found, the searcher automatically goes to step 8 in Figure 4. This means that it is possible that sub-optimal results would be returned. We are currently investigating other ways to solve this problem. In the past, we sorted the hits according to PageRank, which seemed to improve the situation.</p>\n<h4>4.5.1 The Ranking System</h4>\n<p>Google maintains much more information about web documents than typical search engines. Every hitlist includes position, font, and capitalization information. Additionally, we factor in hits from anchor text and the PageRank of the document. Combining all of this information into a rank is difficult. We designed our ranking function so that no particular factor can have too much influence. First, consider the simplest case -- a single word query. In order to rank a document with a single word query, Google looks at that document's hit list for that word. Google considers each hit to be one of several different types (title, anchor, URL, plain text large font, plain text small font, ...), each of which has its own type-weight. The type-weights make up a vector indexed by type. Google counts the number of hits of each type in the hit list. Then every count is converted into a count-weight. Count-weights increase linearly with counts at first but quickly taper off so that more than a certain count will not help. We take the dot product of the vector of count-weights with the vector of type-weights to compute an IR score for the document. Finally, the IR score is combined with PageRank to give a final rank to the document.</p>\n<p>For a multi-word search, the situation is more complicated. Now multiple hit lists must be scanned through at once so that hits occurring close together in a document are weighted higher than hits occurring far apart. The hits from the multiple hit lists are matched up so that nearby hits are matched together. For every matched set of hits, a proximity is computed. The proximity is based on how far apart the hits are in the document (or anchor) but is classified into 10 different value \"bins\" ranging from a phrase match to \"not even close\". Counts are computed not only for every type of hit but for every type and proximity. Every type and proximity pair has a type-prox-weight. The counts are converted into count-weights and we take the dot product of the count-weights and the type-prox-weights to compute an IR score. All of these numbers and matrices can all be displayed with the search results using a special debug mode. These displays have been very helpful in developing the ranking system.</p>\n<h4>4.5.2 Feedback</h4>\n<p>The ranking function has many parameters like the type-weights and the type-prox-weights. Figuring out the right values for these parameters is something of a black art. In order to do this, we have a user feedback mechanism in the search engine. A trusted user may optionally evaluate all of the results that are returned. This feedback is saved. Then when we modify the ranking function, we can see the impact of this change on all previous searches which were ranked. Although far from perfect, this gives us some idea of how a change in the ranking function affects the search results.</p>\n<h2>5 Results and Performance</h2>\n<p>   The most important measure of a search engine is the quality of its search results. While a complete user evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper, our own experience with Google has shown it to produce better results than the major commercial search engines for most searches. As an example which illustrates the use of PageRank, anchor text, and proximity, Figure 4 shows Google's results for a search on \"bill clinton\". These results demonstrates some of Google's features. The results are clustered by server. This helps considerably when sifting through result sets. A number of results are from the whitehouse.gov domain which is what one may reasonably expect from such a search. Currently, most major commercial search engines do not return any results from whitehouse.gov, much less the right ones. Notice that there is no title for the first result. This is because it was not crawled. Instead, Google relied on anchor text to determine this was a good answer to the query. Similarly, the fifth result is an email address which, of course, is not crawlable. It is also a result of anchor text.</p>\n<p>All of the results are reasonably high quality pages and, at last check, none were broken links. This is largely because they all have high PageRank. The PageRanks are the percentages in red along with bar graphs. Finally, there are no results about a Bill other than Clinton or about a Clinton other than Bill. This is because we place heavy importance on the proximity of word occurrences. Of course a true test of the quality of a search engine would involve an extensive user study or results analysis which we do not have room for here. Instead, we invite the reader to try Google for themselves at <a href=\"http://google.stanford.edu/\">http://google.stanford.edu</a>.</p>\n<h3>5.1 Storage Requirements</h3>\n<p>Aside from search quality, Google is designed to scale cost effectively to the size of the Web as it grows. One aspect of this is to use storage efficiently. Table 1 has a breakdown of some statistics and storage requirements of Google. Due to compression the total size of the repository is about 53 GB, just over one third of the total data it stores. At current disk prices this makes the repository a relatively cheap source of useful data. More importantly, the total of all the data used by the search engine requires a comparable amount of storage, about 55 GB. Furthermore, most queries can be answered using just the short inverted index. With better encoding and compression of the Document Index, a high quality web search engine may fit onto a 7GB drive of a new PC.  </p>\n<p>Storage Statistics</p>\n<p>Total Size of Fetched Pages</p>\n<p>147.8 GB</p>\n<p>Compressed Repository</p>\n<p>53.5 GB</p>\n<p>Short Inverted Index</p>\n<p>4.1 GB</p>\n<p>Full Inverted Index</p>\n<p>37.2 GB</p>\n<p>Lexicon</p>\n<p>293 MB</p>\n<p>Temporary Anchor Data <br>\n(not in total)</p>\n<p>6.6 GB</p>\n<p>Document Index Incl. <br>\nVariable Width Data</p>\n<p>9.7 GB</p>\n<p>Links Database</p>\n<p>3.9 GB</p>\n<p>Total Without Repository</p>\n<p>55.2 GB</p>\n<p>Total With Repository</p>\n<p>108.7 GB</p>\n<p>Web Page Statistics</p>\n<p>Number of Web Pages Fetched</p>\n<p>24 million</p>\n<p>Number of Urls Seen</p>\n<p>76.5 million</p>\n<p>Number of Email Addresses</p>\n<p>1.7 million</p>\n<p>Number of 404's</p>\n<p>1.6 million</p>\n<p>Table 1. Statistics</p>\n<h3> 5.2 System Performance</h3>\n<p>It is important for a search engine to crawl and index efficiently. This way information can be kept up to date and major changes to the system can be tested relatively quickly. For Google, the major operations are Crawling, Indexing, and Sorting. It is difficult to measure how long crawling took overall because disks filled up, name servers crashed, or any number of other problems which stopped the system. In total it took roughly 9 days to download the 26 million pages (including errors). However, once the system was running smoothly, it ran much faster, downloading the last 11 million pages in just 63 hours, averaging just over 4 million pages per day or 48.5 pages per second. We ran the indexer and the crawler simultaneously. The indexer ran just faster than the crawlers. This is largely because we spent just enough time optimizing the indexer so that it would not be a bottleneck. These optimizations included bulk updates to the document index and placement of critical data structures on the local disk. The indexer runs at roughly 54 pages per second. The sorters can be run completely in parallel; using four machines, the whole process of sorting takes about 24 hours.</p>\n<h3>5.3 Search Performance</h3>\n<p>Improving the performance of search was not the major focus of our research up to this point. The current version of Google answers most queries in between 1 and 10 seconds. This time is mostly dominated by disk IO over NFS (since disks are spread over a number of machines). Furthermore, Google does not have any optimizations such as query caching, subindices on common terms, and other common optimizations. We intend to speed up Google considerably through distribution and hardware, software, and algorithmic improvements. Our target is to be able to handle several hundred queries per second. Table 2 has some sample query times from the current version of Google. They are repeated to show the speedups resulting from cached IO.</p>\n<p><strong>Initial Query</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Same Query Repeated (IO mostly cached)</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Query</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CPU Time(s)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total Time(s)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CPU Time(s)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Total Time(s)</strong></p>\n<p>al gore</p>\n<p>0.09</p>\n<p>2.13</p>\n<p>0.06</p>\n<p>0.06</p>\n<p>vice president</p>\n<p>1.77</p>\n<p>3.84</p>\n<p>1.66</p>\n<p>1.80</p>\n<p>hard disks</p>\n<p>0.25</p>\n<p>4.86</p>\n<p>0.20</p>\n<p>0.24</p>\n<p>search engines</p>\n<p>1.31</p>\n<p>9.63</p>\n<p>1.16</p>\n<p>1.16</p>\n<p>Table 2. Search Times</p>\n<h2>6 Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Google is designed to be a scalable search engine. The primary goal is to provide high quality search results over a rapidly growing World Wide Web. Google employs a number of techniques to improve search quality including page rank, anchor text, and proximity information. Furthermore, Google is a complete architecture for gathering web pages, indexing them, and performing search queries over them.</p>\n<h3>6.1 Future Work</h3>\n<p>A large-scale web search engine is a complex system and much remains to be done. Our immediate goals are to improve search efficiency and to scale to approximately 100 million web pages. Some simple improvements to efficiency include query caching, smart disk allocation, and subindices. Another area which requires much research is updates. We must have smart algorithms to decide what old web pages should be recrawled and what new ones should be crawled. Work toward this goal has been done in [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Cho 98</a>]. One promising area of research is using proxy caches to build search databases, since they are demand driven. We are planning to add simple features supported by commercial search engines like boolean operators, negation, and stemming. However, other features are just starting to be explored such as relevance feedback and clustering (Google currently supports a simple hostname based clustering). We also plan to support user context (like the user's location), and result summarization. We are also working to extend the use of link structure and link text. Simple experiments indicate PageRank can be personalized by increasing the weight of a user's home page or bookmarks. As for link text, we are experimenting with using text surrounding links in addition to the link text itself. A Web search engine is a very rich environment for research ideas. We have far too many to list here so we do not expect this Future Work section to become much shorter in the near future.</p>\n<h3>6.2 High Quality Search</h3>\n<p>The biggest problem facing users of web search engines today is the quality of the results they get back. While the results are often amusing and expand users' horizons, they are often frustrating and consume precious time. For example, the top result for a search for \"Bill Clinton\" on one of the most popular commercial search engines was the <a href=\"http://www.io.com/~cjburke/clinton/970414.html\">Bill Clinton Joke of the Day: April 14, 1997</a>. Google is designed to provide higher quality search so as the Web continues to grow rapidly, information can be found easily. In order to accomplish this Google makes heavy use of hypertextual information consisting of link structure and link (anchor) text. Google also uses proximity and font information. While evaluation of a search engine is difficult, we have subjectively found that Google returns higher quality search results than current commercial search engines. The analysis of link structure via PageRank allows Google to evaluate the quality of web pages. The use of link text as a description of what the link points to helps the search engine return relevant (and to some degree high quality) results. Finally, the use of proximity information helps increase relevance a great deal for many queries.</p>\n<h3>6.3 Scalable Architecture</h3>\n<p>Aside from the quality of search, Google is designed to scale. It must be efficient in both space and time, and constant factors are very important when dealing with the entire Web. In implementing Google, we have seen bottlenecks in CPU, memory access, memory capacity, disk seeks, disk throughput, disk capacity, and network IO. Google has evolved to overcome a number of these bottlenecks during various operations. Google's major data structures make efficient use of available storage space. Furthermore, the crawling, indexing, and sorting operations are efficient enough to be able to build an index of a substantial portion of the web -- 24 million pages, in less than one week. We expect to be able to build an index of 100 million pages in less than a month.</p>\n<h3>6.4 A Research Tool</h3>\n<p>In addition to being a high quality search engine, Google is a research tool. The data Google has collected has already resulted in many other papers submitted to conferences and many more on the way. Recent research such as [<a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#ref\">Abiteboul 97</a>] has shown a number of limitations to queries about the Web that may be answered without having the Web available locally. This means that Google (or a similar system) is not only a valuable research tool but a necessary one for a wide range of applications. We hope Google will be a resource for searchers and researchers all around the world and will spark the next generation of search engine technology.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/","relativePath":"docs/articles/index.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Articles","weight":0,"excerpt":"my web development articles","seo":{"title":"","description":"This section is similar to a blog but is more technical in nature and time invariant with regard to content.","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>Articles</h2>\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/boring-antonelli-vdxzf?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview\"\n     style=\"width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n     title=\"medium-articles\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/install/","relativePath":"docs/articles/install.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"install.md","name":"install","frontmatter":{"title":"Install","excerpt":"Web-Dev-Hubis a Unibit theme created for project documentations.

When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.</p>\n<p>Whenever a new request is received, the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request\"><code>request</code> event</a> is called, providing two objects: a request (an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage\"><code>http.IncomingMessage</code></a> object) and a response (an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse\"><code>http.ServerResponse</code></a> object).</p>\n<p>Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.</p>\n<p>The first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.</p>\n<p>The second is used to return data to the caller.</p>\n<p>In this case with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">res.statusCode = 200;\n</code></pre>\n<p>we set the statusCode property to 200, to indicate a successful response.</p>\n<p>We set the Content-Type header:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n</code></pre>\n<p>and we close the response, adding the content as an argument to <code>end()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">res.end('Hello World\\n');\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Node.js Frameworks and Tools</h2>\n<p>Node.js is a low-level platform.

For example, in our <em>Asynchronous</em> lesson, we noted how <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#timers_settimeout_callback_delay_args\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Node’s setTimeout</a> has a slightly different return value from <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">a browser’s setTimeout</a>. Let’s go over a few notable differences between the two environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Global vs Window</strong></p>\n<p>In the Node.js runtime, the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">global object</a> is the object where global variables are stored. In browsers, the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">window object</a> is where global variables are stored. The window also includes properties and methods that deal with drawing things on the screen like images, links, and buttons. Node doesn’t need to draw anything, and so it does not come with such properties. This means that you can’t reference window in Node.</p>\n<p><em>Most browsers allow you to reference global but it is really the same object as window.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Document</strong></p>\n<p>Browsers have access to a document object that contains the HTML of a page that will be rendered to the browser window. There is no document in Node.</p>\n<p><strong>Location</strong></p>\n<p>Browsers have access to a location that contains information about the web address being visited in the browser. There is no location in Node, since it is not on the web.</p>\n<p><strong>Require and module.exports</strong></p>\n<p>Node has a predefined require function that we can use to import installed modules like readline. We can also import and export across our own files using require and module.exports. For example, say we had two different files, animals.js and cat.js, that existed in the same directory:</p>\n<p>If we execute animals.js in Node, the program would print ‘Sennacy is a great pet!’.</p>\n<p>Browsers don’t have a notion of a file system so we cannot use require or module.exports in the same way.</p>\n<h3>The fs module</h3>\n<p>Node comes with an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">fs module</a> that contains methods that allow us to interact with our computer’s <strong>F</strong>ile <strong>S</strong>ystem through JavaScript. No additional installations are required; to access this module we can simply <code>require</code> it. We recommend that you code along with this reading. Let's begin with a <code>change-some-files.js</code> script that imports the module:</p>\n<pre><code>// change-some-files.js\n\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n</code></pre>\n<p>Similar to what we saw in the <code>readline</code> lesson, <code>require</code> will return to us a object with many properties that will enable us to do file I/O.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Did you know?</em></strong> <em>I/O is short for input/output. It’s usage is widespread and all the hip tech companies are using it, like.io.</em></p>\n<p>The <code>fs</code> module contains tons of functionality! Chances are that if there is some operation you need to perform regarding files, the <code>fs</code> module supports it. The module also offers both synchronous and asynchronous implementations of these methods. We prefer to not block the thread and so we'll opt for the asynchronous flavors of these methods.</p>\n<h3>Creating a new file</h3>\n<p>To create a file, we can use the <code>writeFile</code> method. According to the documentation, there are a few ways to use it. The most straight forward way is:</p>\n<p>The code a<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bgoonz/8898ad673bd2ecee9d93f8ec267cf213\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">create-a-nnew-file.js (github.com)</a>bove will create a new file called <code>foo.txt</code> in the same directory as our <code>change-some-file.js</code> script. It will write the string <code>'Hello world!'</code> into that newly created file. The third argument specifies the encoding of the characters. There are different ways to encode characters; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">UTF-8</a> is the most common and you'll use this in most scenarios. The fourth argument to <code>writeFile</code> is a callback that will be invoked when the write operation is complete. The docs indicate that if there is an error during the operation (such as an invalid encoding argument), an error object will be passed into the callback. This type of error handling is quite common for asynchronous functions. Like we are used to, since <code>writeFile</code> is asynchronous, we need to utilize <em>callback chaining</em> if we want to guarantee that commands occur <em>after</em> the write is complete or fails.</p>\n<p><em>Beware! If the file name specified to</em> <code>writeFile</code> <em>already exists, it will completely overwrite the contents of that file.</em></p>\n<p>We won’t be using the <code>foo.txt</code> file in the rest of this reading.</p>\n<h3>Reading existing files</h3>\n<p>To explore how to read a file, we’ll use VSCode to manually create a <code>poetry.txt</code> file within the same directory as our <code>change-some-file.js</code> script. Be sure to create this if you are following along.</p>\n<p>Our <code>poetry.txt</code> file will contain the following lines:</p>\n<pre><code>My code fails\n\nI do not know why\n\nMy code works\n\nI do not know why\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can use the <code>readFile</code> method to read the contents of this file. The method accepts very similar arguments to <code>writeFile</code>, except that the callback may be passed an error object and string containing the file contents. In the snippet below, we have replaced our previous <code>writeFile</code> code with <code>readFile</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Running the code above would print the following in the terminal:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>THE CONTENTS ARE:\n\nMy code fails\n\nI do not know why\n\nMy code works\n\nI do not know why\n</code></pre>\n<p>Success! From here, you can do anything you please with the data read from the file. For example, since <code>data</code> is a string, we could split the string on the newline character <code>\\n</code> to obtain an array of the file's lines:</p>\n<pre><code>THE CONTENTS ARE:\n\n[ 'My code fails',\n\n'I do not know why',\n\n'My code works',\n\n'I do not know why' ]\n\nThe third line is My code works\n</code></pre>\n<h3>File I/O</h3>\n<p><em>Using the same</em> <code>poetry.txt</code> <em>file from before:</em></p>\n<pre><code>My code fails\n\nI do not know why\n\nMy code works\n\nI do not know why\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let’s replace occurrences of the phrase ‘do not’ with the word ‘should’.</p>\n<p>We can read the contents of the file as a string, manipulate this string, then write this new string back into the file.</p>\n<p>We’ll need to utilize callback chaining in order for this to work since our file I/O is asynchronous:</p>\n<p>Executing the script above will edit the <code>poetry.txt</code> file to contain:</p>\n<pre><code>My code fails\n\nI should know why\n\nMy code works\n\nI should know why\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Refactor:</h4>\n<h4>If you found this guide helpful feel free to checkout my github/gists where I host similar content:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">bgoonz’s gists · GitHub</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\"><strong>bgoonz — Overview</strong><br />\n<em>Web Developer, Electrical Engineer JavaScript | CSS | Bootstrap | Python | React | Node.js | Express | Sequelize…</em>github.com</a><a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock\"></a></p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/nextjs/","relativePath":"docs/articles/nextjs.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"nextjs.md","name":"nextjs","frontmatter":{"title":"lorem-ipsum","weight":0,"excerpt":"With some basic React and JavaScript knowledge, you’ll be on your wayNext.js is a JavaScript framework created by Zeit.

It lets you build server-side rendering and static web applications using React. It’s a great tool to build your next website. It has many great features and advantages, which can make Nextjs your first option for building your next web application.</p>\n<p>You don’t need any configuration of webpack or similar to start using Next.js. It comes with its configuration. All you need is to run <code>npm run dev</code> and start building your application ?.</p>\n<p>In this article, we are going to explore the great features and tricks of Next.js, and how to start building your next website with it.</p>\n<p><strong>This post assumes that you have some basic knowledge of React and JavaScript.</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some great websites built with Next.js:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://syntax.fm/\">Syntaxt.fm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npmjs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://material-ui.com/\">material-ui.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://expo.io/\">expo.io</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codementor.io/\">codemenitor.io</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I even used Nextjs to build my personal website <a href=\"https://www.saidhayani.me/\">saidhayani.me</a> — you can get the source code on GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/hayanisaid/said-hayani-nextjs\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Getting starting with Next.js</h3>\n<p>To start with Next.js you need to have node.js installed in your machine and that’s all. Next.js is like any other node.js application — you need npm or Yarn to install dependencies.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started and create a Next.js project.</p>\n<p>First, we need to create a folder and give it a name of our choice. I’m gonna name it <code>nextjs-app</code>.</p>\n<p>You can easily do that with this command line:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*k8DzCXqZwRaY64Bhli5-yQ.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>mkdir nextjs-app\n</code></pre>\n<p>After creating the nextjs-app folder, open it on the terminal. Run <code>npm init</code> to create the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>\n<p>Next, we have to install our dependencies.</p>\n<p>Installing Next.js</p>\n<ul>\n<li>using Yarn, type</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>yarn add next\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>using npm, type:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>npm i next --save\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then we have to install React because Next.js uses React. The first line below uses Yarn for the installation.</p>\n<pre><code>yarn add react react-dom\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// with npm\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>npm i react react-dom --save\n</code></pre>\n<p>After that you have to create two necessary folders: <code>pages</code> and <code>static</code> . Next.js won’t work without them!!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*s3N5eZcSSSgRdBiaMQeCRA.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>mkdir pages static\n</code></pre>\n<p>You <strong>must</strong> have this structure after running these commands :</p>\n<pre><code>nextjs-app  -pages  -static  -package.json\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then simply you can run <code>npm next dev</code> and then open <code>[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)</code> in your browser.</p>\n<p>The <code>NotFound</code> page will show up because we don't have any page yet!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Hv_4BaqTnrlriZ8Q3zk5ZQ.png\"></p>\n<p>So let’s create a <code>home</code> page and an entry point <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*IwZ5Ahr9egJ8KHF5HnLfHQ.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>touch index.js home.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then you can write a normal React component. As I said above, Next.js is for building React applications.</p>\n<p>Here is what our <code>home.js</code> looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*He5fQw-VgeY5Gjo2RFGckw.png\"></p>\n<p>And here is our <code>index.js</code> file:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*AgGKp-WdRTwb3bOuqljcug.png\"></p>\n<p>Next.js has a live reload feature. All you need to do is just change and save, and Next.js will compile and reload the app automatically for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Next.js is like any other server-side rendering tool we need to define the default page of our application, in our case is <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n<p>You will see this change in the browser after running <code>npm next dev</code>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*QuQK1J5P0Rc4S-0BhllNmg.png\"></p>\n<p>Congratulations! We just created a Next.js app with a few simple steps. These instructions to create a Next.js app are described in the <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started/first-page\">official docs of Next.js</a> .</p>\n<h4>My alternative</h4>\n<p>I usually don’t use this way. I use the <a href=\"http://import%20react%20from/\">create-next-app</a> CLI instead that will do all this stuff for me in one single line.</p>\n<pre><code>npx create-next-app my-app\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*W5KCIFWP7yMHI-zaeVcmPA.png\"></p>\n<p>You can check out the documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/segmentio/create-next-app\">here</a> to explore more features.</p>\n<h3>Create custom configs for Next.js</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you might want to add some additional dependencies or packages to your Next.js app.</p>\n<p>Next.js gives you the option to customize your configuration using a <code>next-config.js</code> file.</p>\n<p>For example, you might want to add sass support to your app. In this case you have to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-sass\">next-sass</a> package <strong>and</strong> you have to add it to the <code>next-config.js</code> file as in the example below:</p>\n<p>First, install <code>next-sass</code>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*5XSEx8DH0851FNzMxDx5LQ.png\"></p>\n<pre><code>yarn add @zeit/next-sass\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then include it inside the <code>next-config.js</code> file:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*YN_aoR5dzlnMyG2xVHJcww.png\"></p>\n<p>And then you can create write your sass code and import it in your component:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*kde4wjR-EpoNHc1c4JTb8g.png\"></p>\n<p>Importing the sass file in our component:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*yv1cTBXPeONqaV-CS1OZ2A.png\"></p>\n<p>And here is the result:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*VYfSkK1fIZKu75-2P8s4Bw.png\"></p>\n<p>Wow, wasn’t that <strong>super easy</strong> to add sass support to out Next.js app?</p>\n<p>At this point, we just covered the installation and configuration part. Now let’s talk about the features of Next.js!</p>\n<h3>The features</h3>\n<p>Next.js comes with a bunch of great features like server-side rendering, routers, and lazy loading.</p>\n<h4>Server-side rendering</h4>\n<p>Next.js performs server-side rendering by default. This makes your application optimized for search engines. Also, you can integrate any middleware such as <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">express.js</a> or <a href=\"https://hapijs.com/\">Hapi.js</a>, and you can run any database such as MongoDB or MySQL.</p>\n<p>Speaking of search engine optimization, Next.js comes with a <code>Head</code> component that allows you to add and make dynamic meta tags. It’s my favorite feature — you can make custom and dynamic meta tags. These make your website able to be indexed by search engines like Google. Here is an example of a <code>Head</code> component :</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*mnIJGBgF59r1YjX5jXu8IA.png\"></p>\n<p>And you can import and use the<code>Head</code> component in any other page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*liF5bNPAQ_j7gA9funSGTg.png\"></p>\n<p>Awesome!</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: With Next.js you <strong>don’t</strong> need to import React because Next.js does this for you.</p>\n<h4>Generating a static website with Next.js</h4>\n<p>As well as server-side rendering, you still can compile and export your application as an HTML static website and deploy it on a static website hosting like a GitHub page or <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">netlify</a>. You can learn more how to make a static website with Next.js <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/learn/excel/static-html-export/setup\">here in the official docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Routers</h4>\n<p>This is another one of the great features of Next.js. When you use the <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\">create-react-app</a>, you usually need to install <a href=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\">react-router</a> and create its custom configuration.</p>\n<p>Next.js comes with its own routers with zero configs. You don’t need any extra configuration of your routers. Just create your page inside the <code>pages</code> folder and Next.js will take care of all routing configuration.</p>\n<p>Let’s go ahead and create a custom navigation to make everything clear!</p>\n<p>To navigate between pages, Next.js has the <code>Link</code> method to manage the navigation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*D54h6wnKX9fCS0AU34tVLA.png\"></p>\n<p>Let’s create <code>blog.js</code> and <code>contact.js</code> pages:</p>\n<p><code>blog.js</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*f6_vaaPs1Okfj8vZ9Fhk8g.png\"></p>\n<p>And here is the <code>contact.js</code> page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*5lWCDzAUWed2NlsGpTC5EQ.png\"></p>\n<p>And now we must be able to navigate between those pages ?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*7WYZeRb92PAwqthLo0xqHg.gif\"></p>\n<p>Wow that so easy and super awesome.</p>\n<h4>Lazy loading</h4>\n<p>Lazy loading makes your application deliver a better user experience. Sometimes the page might take time to load. The user may abandon your app if the loading takes more than 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>The way to avoid this is to use some trick to indicate to the user that the page is loading, for example by displaying a spinner. Lazy loading or code splitting is one of the features that allow you to deal with, and control, slow loading so you only load the necessary code in your page.</p>\n<p>Next.js comes with its own code splitting method. It provides us a method, called <code>dynamic</code>, to load our component, as in the example below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*Ib835M7Ih-RY1kRBOUnXFA.png\"></p>\n<p>You can find the source code of these examples on <a href=\"https://github.com/hayanisaid/nextjs-intro-example\">GitHub</a></p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/node-cli-args/","relativePath":"docs/articles/node-cli-args.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"node-cli-args.md","name":"node-cli-args","frontmatter":{"title":"where-is-npm-pack","weight":0,"excerpt":"How to find out where npm installs the packages","seo":{"title":"npm packages","description":"When you install a package using npm you can perform 2 types of installation:\na local install\na global install\n\nBy default, when you type an npm install command, like:\nthe package is installed in the current file tree, under the node_modules subfolder.\n","robots":[],"extra":[{"name":"og:description","value":"When you install a package using npm you can perform 2 types of installation:\na local install\na global install\n\nBy default, when you type an npm install command, like:\nthe package is installed in the current file tree, under the node_modules subfolder.\n","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":false}],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>When you install a package using npm you can perform 2 types of installation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a local install</li>\n<li>a global install</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By default, when you type an npm install command, like:</p>\n<p>the package is installed in the current file tree, under the node_modules subfolder.</p>\n<p>As this happens, npm also adds the lodash entry in the dependencies property of the package.json file present in the current folder.</p>\n<p>A global installation is performed using the -g flag:</p>\n<p>When this happens, npm won't install the package under the local folder, but instead, it will use a global location.</p>\n<p>Where, exactly?</p>\n<p>The npm root -g command will tell you where that exact location is on your machine.</p>\n<p>On macOS or Linux this location could be /usr/local/lib/node<em>modules.

For example, consider a file named <code>foo.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const circle = require('./circle.js');\nconsole.log(`The area of a circle of radius 4 is ${circle.area(4)}`);\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the first line, <code>foo.js</code> loads the module <code>circle.js</code> that is in the same directory as <code>foo.js</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are the contents of <code>circle.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const { PI } = Math;\n\nexports.area = (r) => PI * r ** 2;\n\nexports.circumference = (r) => 2 * PI * r;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The module <code>circle.js</code> has exported the functions <code>area()</code> and <code>circumference()</code>. Functions and objects are added to the root of a module by specifying additional properties on the special <code>exports</code> object.</p>\n<p>Variables local to the module will be private, because the module is wrapped in a function by Node.js (see <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_wrapper\">module wrapper</a>). In this example, the variable <code>PI</code> is private to <code>circle.js</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>module.exports</code> property can be assigned a new value (such as a function or object).</p>\n<p>Below, <code>bar.js</code> makes use of the <code>square</code> module, which exports a Square class:</p>\n<pre><code>const Square = require('./square.js');\nconst mySquare = new Square(2);\nconsole.log(`The area of mySquare is ${mySquare.area()}`);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>square</code> module is defined in <code>square.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Assigning to exports will not modify module, must use module.exports\nmodule.exports = class Square {\n  constructor(width) {\n    this.width = width;\n  }\n\n  area() {\n    return this.width ** 2;\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>The module system is implemented in the <code>require('module')</code> module.</p>\n<h3>Accessing the main module<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_accessing_the_main_module\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When a file is run directly from Node.js, <code>require.main</code> is set to its <code>module</code>. That means that it is possible to determine whether a file has been run directly by testing <code>require.main === module</code>.</p>\n<p>For a file <code>foo.js</code>, this will be <code>true</code> if run via <code>node foo.js</code>, but <code>false</code> if run by <code>require('./foo')</code>.</p>\n<p>Because <code>module</code> provides a <code>filename</code> property (normally equivalent to <code>__filename</code>), the entry point of the current application can be obtained by checking <code>require.main.filename</code>.</p>\n<h3>Package manager tips<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_package_manager_tips\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The semantics of the Node.js <code>require()</code> function were designed to be general enough to support reasonable directory structures. Package manager programs such as <code>dpkg</code>, <code>rpm</code>, and <code>npm</code> will hopefully find it possible to build native packages from Node.js modules without modification.</p>\n<p>Below we give a suggested directory structure that could work:</p>\n<p>Let's say that we wanted to have the folder at <code>/usr/lib/node/&#x3C;some-package>/&#x3C;some-version></code> hold the contents of a specific version of a package.</p>\n<p>Packages can depend on one another. In order to install package <code>foo</code>, it may be necessary to install a specific version of package <code>bar</code>. The <code>bar</code> package may itself have dependencies, and in some cases, these may even collide or form cyclic dependencies.</p>\n<p>Because Node.js looks up the <code>realpath</code> of any modules it loads (that is, it resolves symlinks) and then <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_node_modules_folders\">looks for their dependencies in <code>node_modules</code> folders</a>, this situation can be resolved with the following architecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/</code>: Contents of the <code>foo</code> package, version 1.2.3.</li>\n<li><code>/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/</code>: Contents of the <code>bar</code> package that <code>foo</code> depends on.</li>\n<li><code>/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/node_modules/bar</code>: Symbolic link to <code>/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/</code>.</li>\n<li><code>/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/node_modules/*</code>: Symbolic links to the packages that <code>bar</code> depends on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, even if a cycle is encountered, or if there are dependency conflicts, every module will be able to get a version of its dependency that it can use.</p>\n<p>When the code in the <code>foo</code> package does <code>require('bar')</code>, it will get the version that is symlinked into <code>/usr/lib/node/foo/1.2.3/node_modules/bar</code>. Then, when the code in the <code>bar</code> package calls <code>require('quux')</code>, it'll get the version that is symlinked into <code>/usr/lib/node/bar/4.3.2/node_modules/quux</code>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, to make the module lookup process even more optimal, rather than putting packages directly in <code>/usr/lib/node</code>, we could put them in <code>/usr/lib/node_modules/&#x3C;name>/&#x3C;version></code>. Then Node.js will not bother looking for missing dependencies in <code>/usr/node_modules</code> or <code>/node_modules</code>.</p>\n<p>In order to make modules available to the Node.js REPL, it might be useful to also add the <code>/usr/lib/node_modules</code> folder to the <code>$NODE_PATH</code> environment variable. Since the module lookups using <code>node_modules</code> folders are all relative, and based on the real path of the files making the calls to <code>require()</code>, the packages themselves can be anywhere.</p>\n<h3>The <code>.mjs</code> extension<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_mjs_extension\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It is not possible to <code>require()</code> files that have the <code>.mjs</code> extension. Attempting to do so will throw <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_err_require_esm\">an error</a>. The <code>.mjs</code> extension is reserved for <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html\">ECMAScript Modules</a> which cannot be loaded via <code>require()</code>.

This means (among other things) that every call to <code>require('foo')</code> will get exactly the same object returned, if it would resolve to the same file.</p>\n<p>Provided <code>require.cache</code> is not modified, multiple calls to <code>require('foo')</code> will not cause the module code to be executed multiple times. This is an important feature. With it, \"partially done\" objects can be returned, thus allowing transitive dependencies to be loaded even when they would cause cycles.</p>\n<p>To have a module execute code multiple times, export a function, and call that function.</p>\n<h4>Module caching caveats<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_caching_caveats\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Modules are cached based on their resolved filename. Since modules may resolve to a different filename based on the location of the calling module (loading from <code>node_modules</code> folders), it is not a <em>guarantee</em> that <code>require('foo')</code> will always return the exact same object, if it would resolve to different files.</p>\n<p>Additionally, on case-insensitive file systems or operating systems, different resolved filenames can point to the same file, but the cache will still treat them as different modules and will reload the file multiple times. For example, <code>require('./foo')</code> and <code>require('./FOO')</code> return two different objects, irrespective of whether or not <code>./foo</code> and <code>./FOO</code> are the same file.</p>\n<h3>Core modules<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_core_modules\">#</a></h3>\n<p>History</p>\n<p>Node.js has several modules compiled into the binary. These modules are described in greater detail elsewhere in this documentation.</p>\n<p>The core modules are defined within the Node.js source and are located in the <code>lib/</code> folder.</p>\n<p>Core modules are always preferentially loaded if their identifier is passed to <code>require()</code>. For instance, <code>require('http')</code> will always return the built in HTTP module, even if there is a file by that name.</p>\n<p>Core modules can also be identified using the <code>node:</code> prefix, in which case it bypasses the <code>require</code> cache. For instance, <code>require('node:http')</code> will always return the built in HTTP module, even if there is <code>require.cache</code> entry by that name.</p>\n<h3>Cycles<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_cycles\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When there are circular <code>require()</code> calls, a module might not have finished executing when it is returned.</p>\n<p>Consider this situation:</p>\n<p><code>a.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>console.log('a starting');\nexports.done = false;\nconst b = require('./b.js');\nconsole.log('in a, b.done = %j', b.done);\nexports.done = true;\nconsole.log('a done');\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>b.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>console.log('b starting');\nexports.done = false;\nconst a = require('./a.js');\nconsole.log('in b, a.done = %j', a.done);\nexports.done = true;\nconsole.log('b done');\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>main.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>console.log('main starting');\nconst a = require('./a.js');\nconst b = require('./b.js');\nconsole.log('in main, a.done = %j, b.done = %j', a.done, b.done);\n</code></pre>\n<p>When <code>main.js</code> loads <code>a.js</code>, then <code>a.js</code> in turn loads <code>b.js</code>. At that point, <code>b.js</code> tries to load <code>a.js</code>. In order to prevent an infinite loop, an unfinished copy of the <code>a.js</code> exports object is returned to the <code>b.js</code> module. <code>b.js</code> then finishes loading, and its <code>exports</code> object is provided to the <code>a.js</code> module.</p>\n<p>By the time <code>main.js</code> has loaded both modules, they're both finished. The output of this program would thus be:</p>\n<pre><code>$ node main.js\nmain starting\na starting\nb starting\nin b, a.done = false\nb done\nin a, b.done = true\na done\nin main, a.done = true, b.done = true\n</code></pre>\n<p>Careful planning is required to allow cyclic module dependencies to work correctly within an application.</p>\n<h3>File modules<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_file_modules\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If the exact filename is not found, then Node.js will attempt to load the required filename with the added extensions: <code>.js</code>, <code>.json</code>, and finally <code>.node</code>.</p>\n<p><code>.js</code> files are interpreted as JavaScript text files, and <code>.json</code> files are parsed as JSON text files. <code>.node</code> files are interpreted as compiled addon modules loaded with <code>process.dlopen()</code>.</p>\n<p>A required module prefixed with <code>'/'</code> is an absolute path to the file. For example, <code>require('/home/marco/foo.js')</code> will load the file at <code>/home/marco/foo.js</code>.</p>\n<p>A required module prefixed with <code>'./'</code> is relative to the file calling <code>require()</code>. That is, <code>circle.js</code> must be in the same directory as <code>foo.js</code> for <code>require('./circle')</code> to find it.</p>\n<p>Without a leading <code>'/'</code>, <code>'./'</code>, or <code>'../'</code> to indicate a file, the module must either be a core module or is loaded from a <code>node_modules</code> folder.</p>\n<p>If the given path does not exist, <code>require()</code> will throw an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_class_error\"><code>Error</code></a> with its <code>code</code> property set to <code>'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'</code>.</p>\n<h3>Folders as modules<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_folders_as_modules\">#</a></h3>\n<p>It is convenient to organize programs and libraries into self-contained directories, and then provide a single entry point to those directories. There are three ways in which a folder may be passed to <code>require()</code> as an argument.</p>\n<p>The first is to create a <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_node_js_package_json_field_definitions\"><code>package.json</code></a> file in the root of the folder, which specifies a <code>main</code> module. An example <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_node_js_package_json_field_definitions\"><code>package.json</code></a> file might look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>{ \"name\" : \"some-library\",\n  \"main\" : \"./lib/some-library.js\" }\n</code></pre>\n<p>If this was in a folder at <code>./some-library</code>, then <code>require('./some-library')</code> would attempt to load <code>./some-library/lib/some-library.js</code>.</p>\n<p>This is the extent of the awareness of <code>package.json</code> files within Node.js.</p>\n<p>If there is no <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_node_js_package_json_field_definitions\"><code>package.json</code></a> file present in the directory, or if the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_main\"><code>\"main\"</code></a> entry is missing or cannot be resolved, then Node.js will attempt to load an <code>index.js</code> or <code>index.node</code> file out of that directory. For example, if there was no <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_node_js_package_json_field_definitions\"><code>package.json</code></a> file in the previous example, then <code>require('./some-library')</code> would attempt to load:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>./some-library/index.js</code></li>\n<li><code>./some-library/index.node</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If these attempts fail, then Node.js will report the entire module as missing with the default error:</p>\n<pre><code>Error: Cannot find module 'some-library'\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Loading from <code>node_modules</code> folders<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_node_modules_folders\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If the module identifier passed to <code>require()</code> is not a <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_core_modules\">core</a> module, and does not begin with <code>'/'</code>, <code>'../'</code>, or <code>'./'</code>, then Node.js starts at the parent directory of the current module, and adds <code>/node_modules</code>, and attempts to load the module from that location. Node.js will not append <code>node_modules</code> to a path already ending in <code>node_modules</code>.</p>\n<p>If it is not found there, then it moves to the parent directory, and so on, until the root of the file system is reached.</p>\n<p>For example, if the file at <code>'/home/ry/projects/foo.js'</code> called <code>require('bar.js')</code>, then Node.js would look in the following locations, in this order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/home/ry/projects/node_modules/bar.js</code></li>\n<li><code>/home/ry/node_modules/bar.js</code></li>\n<li><code>/home/node_modules/bar.js</code></li>\n<li><code>/node_modules/bar.js</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This allows programs to localize their dependencies, so that they do not clash.</p>\n<p>It is possible to require specific files or sub modules distributed with a module by including a path suffix after the module name. For instance <code>require('example-module/path/to/file')</code> would resolve <code>path/to/file</code> relative to where <code>example-module</code> is located. The suffixed path follows the same module resolution semantics.</p>\n<h3>Loading from the global folders<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If the <code>NODE_PATH</code> environment variable is set to a colon-delimited list of absolute paths, then Node.js will search those paths for modules if they are not found elsewhere.</p>\n<p>On Windows, <code>NODE_PATH</code> is delimited by semicolons (<code>;</code>) instead of colons.</p>\n<p><code>NODE_PATH</code> was originally created to support loading modules from varying paths before the current <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together\">module resolution</a> algorithm was defined.</p>\n<p><code>NODE_PATH</code> is still supported, but is less necessary now that the Node.js ecosystem has settled on a convention for locating dependent modules. Sometimes deployments that rely on <code>NODE_PATH</code> show surprising behavior when people are unaware that <code>NODE_PATH</code> must be set. Sometimes a module's dependencies change, causing a different version (or even a different module) to be loaded as the <code>NODE_PATH</code> is searched.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Node.js will search in the following list of GLOBAL_FOLDERS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1: <code>$HOME/.node_modules</code></li>\n<li>2: <code>$HOME/.node_libraries</code></li>\n<li>3: <code>$PREFIX/lib/node</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where <code>$HOME</code> is the user's home directory, and <code>$PREFIX</code> is the Node.js configured <code>node_prefix</code>.</p>\n<p>These are mostly for historic reasons.</p>\n<p>It is strongly encouraged to place dependencies in the local <code>node_modules</code> folder. These will be loaded faster, and more reliably.</p>\n<h3>The module wrapper<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_wrapper\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Before a module's code is executed, Node.js will wrap it with a function wrapper that looks like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>(function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {\n// Module code actually lives in here\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>By doing this, Node.js achieves a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It keeps top-level variables (defined with <code>var</code>, <code>const</code> or <code>let</code>) scoped to the module rather than the global object.</li>\n<li>\n<p>It helps to provide some global-looking variables that are actually specific to the module, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>module</code> and <code>exports</code> objects that the implementor can use to export values from the module.</li>\n<li>The convenience variables <code>__filename</code> and <code>__dirname</code>, containing the module's absolute filename and directory path.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The module scope<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_scope\">#</a></h3>\n<h4><code>__dirname</code><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_dirname\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Added in: v0.1.27</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type\"><string></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The directory name of the current module.

Sometimes this is not acceptable; many want their module to be an instance of some class. To do this, assign the desired export object to <code>module.exports</code>. Assigning the desired object to <code>exports</code> will simply rebind the local <code>exports</code> variable, which is probably not what is desired.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose we were making a module called <code>a.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const EventEmitter = require('events');\n\nmodule.exports = new EventEmitter();\n\n// Do some work, and after some time emit\n// the 'ready' event from the module itself.\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  module.exports.emit('ready');\n}, 1000);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then in another file we could do:</p>\n<pre><code>const a = require('./a');\na.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log('module \"a\" is ready');\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Assignment to <code>module.exports</code> must be done immediately.

In this example, define a function.\n    function someFunc() {}\n    exports = someFunc;\n    // At this point, exports is no longer a shortcut to module.exports, and\n    // this module will still export an empty default object.\n    module.exports = someFunc;\n    // At this point, the module will now export someFunc, instead of the\n    // default object.\n  })(module, module.exports);\n  return module.exports;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4><code>module.filename</code><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_filename\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Added in: v0.1.16</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type\"><string></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fully resolved filename of the module.</p>\n<h4><code>module.id</code><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_id\">#</a></h4>\n<p>Added in: v0.1.16</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type\"><string></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The identifier for the module.

We refer to \"package\" but the same thing applies to local applications which you do not use as packages.</p>\n<p>Most of those properties are only used on <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">https://www.npmjs.com/</a>, others by scripts that interact with your code, like npm or others.</p>\n<h3>name</h3>\n<p>Sets the package name.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>The name must be less than 214 characters, must not have spaces, it can only contain lowercase letters, hyphens (-) or underscores (_).</p>\n<p>This is because when a package is published on npm, it gets its own URL based on this property.</p>\n<p>If you published this package publicly on GitHub, a good value for this property is the GitHub repository name.</p>\n<h3>author</h3>\n<p>Lists the package author name</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Can also be used with this format:</p>\n<h3>contributors</h3>\n<p>As well as the author, the project can have one or more contributors. This property is an array that lists them.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Can also be used with this format:</p>\n<h3>bugs</h3>\n<p>Links to the package issue tracker, most likely a GitHub issues page</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>homepage</h3>\n<p>Sets the package homepage</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>version</h3>\n<p>Indicates the current version of the package.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>This property follows the semantic versioning (semver) notation for versions, which means the version is always expressed with 3 numbers: x.x.x.</p>\n<p>The first number is the major version, the second the minor version and the third is the patch version.</p>\n<p>There is a meaning in these numbers: a release that only fixes bugs is a patch release, a release that introduces backward-compatible changes is a minor release, a major release can have breaking changes.</p>\n<h3>license</h3>\n<p>Indicates the license of the package.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>keywords</h3>\n<p>This property contains an array of keywords that associate with what your package does.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>This helps people find your package when navigating similar packages, or when browsing the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">https://www.npmjs.com/</a> website.</p>\n<h3>description</h3>\n<p>This property contains a brief description of the package</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>This is especially useful if you decide to publish your package to npm so that people can find out what the package is about.</p>\n<h3>repository</h3>\n<p>This property specifies where this package repository is located.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Notice the github prefix. There are other popular services baked in:</p>\n<p>You can explicitly set the version control system:</p>\n<p>You can use different version control systems:</p>\n<h3>main</h3>\n<p>Sets the entry point for the package.</p>\n<p>When you import this package in an application, that's where the application will search for the module exports.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>private</h3>\n<p>if set to true prevents the app/package to be accidentally published on npm</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>scripts</h3>\n<p>Defines a set of node scripts you can run</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>These scripts are command line applications. You can run them by calling npm run XXXX or yarn XXXX, where XXXX is the command name. Example: npm run dev.</p>\n<p>You can use any name you want for a command, and scripts can do literally anything you want.</p>\n<h3>dependencies</h3>\n<p>Sets a list of npm packages installed as dependencies.</p>\n<p>When you install a package using npm or yarn:</p>\n<p>that package is automatically inserted in this list.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>devDependencies</h3>\n<p>Sets a list of npm packages installed as development dependencies.</p>\n<p>They differ from dependencies because they are meant to be installed only on a development machine, not needed to run the code in production.</p>\n<p>When you install a package using npm or yarn:</p>\n<p>that package is automatically inserted in this list.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>engines</h3>\n<p>Sets which versions of Node.js and other commands this package/app work on</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<h3>browserslist</h3>\n<p>Is used to tell which browsers (and their versions) you want to support. It's referenced by Babel, Autoprefixer, and other tools, to only add the polyfills and fallbacks needed to the browsers you target.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>This configuration means you want to support the last 2 major versions of all browsers with at least 1% of usage (from the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\">CanIUse.com</a> stats), except IE8 and lower.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserslist\">see more</a>)</p>\n<h3>Command-specific properties</h3>\n<p>The package.json file can also host command-specific configuration, for example for Babel, ESLint, and more.</p>\n<p>Each has a specific property, like eslintConfig, babel and others. Those are command-specific, and you can find how to use those in the respective command/project documentation.</p>\n<h2>Package versions</h2>\n<p>You have seen in the description above version numbers like these: ~3.0.0 or ^0.13.0. What do they mean, and which other version specifiers can you use?</p>\n<p>That symbol specifies which updates your package accepts, from that dependency.</p>\n<p>Given that using semver (semantic versioning) all versions have 3 digits, the first being the major release, the second the minor release and the third is the patch release, you have these \"<a href=\"https://nodejs.dev/learn/semantic-versioning-using-npm/\">Rules</a>\".</p>\n<p>You can combine most of the versions in ranges, like this: 1.0.0 || >=1.1.0 &#x3C;1.2.0, to either use 1.0.0 or one release from 1.1.0 up, but lower than 1.2.0.</p>\n<h1>Cheat Sheet:</h1>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">/* *******************************************************************************************\n * SYNOPSIS\n * http://nodejs.org/api/synopsis.html\n * ******************************************************************************************* */\n\n\nvar http = require('http');\n\n// An example of a web server written with Node which responds with 'Hello World'.\n// To run the server, put the code into a file called example.js and execute it with the node program.\nhttp.createServer(function (request, response) {\n  response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n  response.end('Hello World\\n');\n}).listen(8124);\n\nconsole.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');\n\n\n/* *******************************************************************************************\n * GLOBAL OBJECTS\n * http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html\n * ******************************************************************************************* */\n\n\n// In browsers, the top-level scope is the global scope.\n// That means that in browsers if you're in the global scope var something will define a global variable.\n// In Node this is different.

Those do not exist in Node.js, of course. You don't have the <code>document</code>, <code>window</code> and all the other objects that are provided by the browser.</p>\n<p>And in the browser, we don't have all the nice APIs that Node.js provides through its modules, like the filesystem access functionality.</p>\n<p>Another big difference is that in Node.js you control the environment.

Make sure you check it out as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Downloads</h2>\n<p><code>npm</code> manages downloads of dependencies of your project.</p>\n<h3>Installing all dependencies</h3>\n<p>If a project has a <code>package.json</code> file, by running</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install\n</code></pre>\n<p>it will install everything the project needs, in the <code>node_modules</code> folder, creating it if it's not existing already.</p>\n<h3>Installing a single package</h3>\n<p>You can also install a specific package by running</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install &#x3C;package-name>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Often you'll see more flags added to this command:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--save</code> installs and adds the entry to the <code>package.json</code> file <em>dependencies</em></li>\n<li><code>--save-dev</code> installs and adds the entry to the <code>package.json</code> file <em>devDependencies</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The difference is mainly that devDependencies are usually development tools, like a testing library, while <code>dependencies</code> are bundled with the app in production.</p>\n<h3>Updating packages</h3>\n<p>Updating is also made easy, by running</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">npm update\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>npm</code> will check all packages for a newer version that satisfies your versioning constraints.</p>\n<p>You can specify a single package to update as well:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">npm update &#x3C;package-name>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Versioning</h2>\n<p>In addition to plain downloads, <code>npm</code> also manages <strong>versioning</strong>, so you can specify any specific version of a package, or require a version higher or lower than what you need.</p>\n<p>Many times you'll find that a library is only compatible with a major release of another library.</p>\n<p>Or a bug in the latest release of a lib, still unfixed, is causing an issue.</p>\n<p>Specifying an explicit version of a library also helps to keep everyone on the same exact version of a package, so that the whole team runs the same version until the <code>package.json</code> file is updated.</p>\n<p>In all those cases, versioning helps a lot, and <code>npm</code> follows the semantic versioning (semver) standard.</p>\n<h2>Running Tasks</h2>\n<p>The package.json file supports a format for specifying command line tasks that can be run by using</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">npm run &#x3C;task-name>\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"start-dev\": \"node lib/server-development\",\n        \"start\": \"node lib/server-production\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's very common to use this feature to run Webpack:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"watch\": \"webpack --watch --progress --colors --config webpack.conf.js\",\n        \"dev\": \"webpack --progress --colors --config webpack.conf.js\",\n        \"prod\": \"NODE_ENV=production webpack -p --config webpack.conf.js\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So instead of typing those long commands, which are easy to forget or mistype, you can run</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ npm run watch\n$ npm run dev\n$ npm run prod\n</code></pre>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/npx/","relativePath":"docs/articles/npx.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"npx.md","name":"npx","frontmatter":{"title":"The

publish most of the executable commands as global packages, in order for them to be in the path and executable immediately.</p>\n<p>This was a pain because you could not really install different versions of the same command.</p>\n<p>Running <code>npx commandname</code> automatically finds the correct reference of the command inside the <code>node_modules</code> folder of a project, without needing to know the exact path, and without requiring the package to be installed globally and in the user's path.</p>\n<h2>Installation-less command execution</h2>\n<p>There is another great feature of <code>npx</code>, which is allowing to run commands without first installing them.</p>\n<p>This is pretty useful, mostly because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you don't need to install anything</li>\n<li>you can run different versions of the same command, using the syntax @version</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A typical demonstration of using <code>npx</code> is through the <code>cowsay</code> command. <code>cowsay</code> will print a cow saying what you wrote in the command. For example:</p>\n<p><code>cowsay \"Hello\"</code> will print</p>\n<pre><code> _______\n&#x3C; Hello >\n -------\n        \\   ^__^\n         \\  (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n</code></pre>\n<p>This only works if you have the <code>cowsay</code> command globally installed from npm previously.

They would choose the typeface, and in the early days even make the matrix and cast the type themselves. They would lay out the lines of text, choosing suitable spacing in each line, deciding where to break the line and adding hyphens to improve the overall look of the page while maintaining readability. The page was then set in the press and pages were printed.</p>\n<p>Even before that, the monks who copied manuscripts did everything themselves, copying the text and adding beautiful illuminations to each page to add to the value of the book.</p>\n<p>As the industry developed though, the task of type-setter became more mechanical. Other people became expert in how to best lay out pages, what visual design elements would best communicate the desired message etc. The type-setter still made the technical choices to achieve the desired goals, but didn't have to be an expert in design. The production of a printed document would involve a number of people who were expert in their given area, from author to visual designer to type-setter.</p>\n<p>This team based approach to document production means that each person can develop their own expertise and to a certain extent, doesn't need to worry about what the people later in the chain will do. The author doesn't worry about how to place figures or images in the page, just that they will be there; the designer doesn't need to be concerned about kerning and the use of em-spaces in type-setting; the type-setter isn't an expert in the content of the text. All can work together to produce a superior printed document.</p>\n<p>The world of document production worked like this for a long time until the invention of the personal computer and <em>Desktop Publishing</em> software. Suddenly, authors became designers and type-setters through easy to use computer software. They could choose fonts, set margins, force hyphenation and make minute decisions about the layout and look and feel of each page. Not surprisingly, this becomes a significant distraction from the task of creating content, but it also means that the expertise of the specialist designer or type-setter isn't used any more. This might lead to more productivity as the production process is compressed, but it doesn't usually lead to more readable, better presented documents; many of the early self-produced documents were an unsightly mix of fonts, colours and sizes.</p>\n<p>If we fast-forward to the software tools we have today for document production, it's interesting to note that the expertise of the designer and typesetter has crept back in to the process. Rather than being involved in the production of every document, these people are now able to write stylesheets and templates as well as contribute to the algorithms used in the software to lay out the text on a page. Most companies will have a standard document template that is used for reports or letters, this has usually been designed by a professional and all the author needs to do is enter the text in the right place. Stylesheets in word processors mean that there will be a consistency of font use throughout the document and importantly, that the decisions on which fonts and how they are used doesn't need to be made by the author.</p>\n<p>So, to summarise this little discussion of history, there have always been people who's expertise is the way that a text is rendered on the page. With the onset of desktop publishing software, there has been a tendency for the author to spend time in document design, meaning that the relevant expertise was not being applied. However, modern software now allows for the designer's voice to be heard again through the use of stylesheets and document templates. This leaves the author to concentrate on the text meaning they will be more productive and should produce better looking documents as well.</p>\n<h2>Web Document Production</h2>\n<p>Fundamentally, the web is a technology for delivering content to readers through a document based interface (the web browser). So, producing web content is a document production process and as such, should parallel the ideas discussed above. It's interesting to look at the development of HTML and see how it parallels the developments described above.</p>\n<p>Early HTML was a language for encoding content. It included tags for headings, paragraphs, lists etc. but didn't provide any way to change the way these things were rendered by the browser. The browser made sensible decisions and web documents all looked about the same. The focus was on the content. Soon, <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/Projects/mosaic.html\">graphical browsers</a> started to appear that allowed images to be included in pages and people started to want to have some control over the appearance of their pages.</p>\n<p>The growth of the web into the commercial arena and the wider range of documents being published led to the 'browser wars' between Netscape and Microsoft. One of the features of this war was the arms race of features in each browser designed to make web pages look better. Each vendor would introduce new ways to control the look and feel of pages, for example the &#x3C;FONT> tag was introduced by Netscape to allow control of the font used to display text while Microsoft included the &#x3C;MARQUEE> tag that displayed text scrolling across the page. Eventually, some of these tags were standardised into a later version of HTML and were implemented by most of the browsers. These tags encouraged authors to get involved in page design, in fact they had to since the only way to control the appearance of a page was to insert codes into the text.</p>\n<p>While the &#x3C;FONT> tag allowed some control over the appearance of text, there was still a problem of laying out a page as a whole. The solution that became standard practice was to mis-use the &#x3C;TABLE> tag and construct the whole page as a table with rows and columns for the different page elements such as header, menu, content and footer. This worked really well, but again meant that the HTML code that an author was writing had to contain a lot of information about the layout of the page. In addition, it was common for people to mis-use tags just for the sake of appearance, for example to have more control over the appearance of headings, one might just encode them using &#x3C;B> or &#x3C;FONT> tags rather than header tags.</p>\n<p>All of these additions to HTML and the mis-use of existing tags meant that a language that was originally designed to allow authors to concentrate on content had turned into a page layout language. Luckily, sense has prevailed and we have now developed ways to control page layout without adding special instructions into the HTML code - that is, we have the Cascading Stylesheet language (CSS). Once again, we can let the author concentrate on content in HTML while all (or most) design decisions are encoded in the stylesheet.</p>\n<p>The current suite of web languages understood by your browser (HTML, CSS and Javascript) each serve different roles in the web development process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML - Content</li>\n<li>CSS - Style</li>\n<li>Javascript - Behaviour</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The third of these - Javascript and Behaviour - refer to the way that Javascript can be used to change the way that the user interacts with the page. This doesn't really have an analogue in the print document production world but it's an important aspect of modern web content production. It fits into this framework because the behavioural changes that Javascript can introduce should not be the concern of the content author or the visual designer (though both might have opinions on what they'd like to see).</p>\n<p>It is useful to think of these three aspects of web design as independent things. The same web content could be presented using alternate stylesheets and have a completely different impact. Similarly, Javascript can be used to change the way that a user interacts with content, making it more usable. We can see the Style and Behaviour aspects as layers that are applied to the core Content to enhance it for the user.</p>\n<h2>The Separation of Concerns</h2>\n<p>From a Computer Science/Software Engineering point of view there is a very important principle called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">Separation of Concerns</a> (SoC) that is illustrated perfectly by the way that the various web languages have evolved. The SoC principle is about partitioning the work that we do in software development into parts that can be considered separately. This is achieved by <em>modularisation</em> within a software project and is helped by things like classes and interface descriptions between modules</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in fact these things have been developed to support SoC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The SoC principle allows us to develop large complex software by allowing us to concentrate on different aspects of the solution. It could be that we do that alone, spending time on one aspect and then another, or as a team with different people assigned to different aspects. Either way, being able to work on part of the problem makes it manageable and improves the overall quality of the solution.</p>\n<p>In web development, the separation of concerns is supported by the different languages that work together to build a modern web application. It is important to recognise this and make sure that we use each of these tools in such a way as to respect their roles and capabilities. So, while it is possible to use HTML structures to make text large and bold for a heading, we don't, we use one of the header tags and rely on the stylesheet to apply the appropriate settings. Having the author respect good HTML usage means that the designer can make assumptions about the page structure in the stylesheet and ensure that the document appearance is consistent for the user.</p>\n<h2>Semantic HTML Markup</h2>\n<p>One corollary of this kind of thinking is that each component that we use should be used as it was designed and according to it's role in the overall picture. In particular for HTML this implies that the markup we use should encode only the <em>structure</em> of the document rather than aspects of the <em>appearance</em> which is properly dealt with using CSS. Further, this means that we should use markup in a way that imparts useful <em>meaning</em> to the document structure. This is generally known as using <em>Semantic HTML</em> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML\">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/posh\">POSH</a> on Microformats.org) and is the current best practice in HTML authoring.</p>\n<p>To clarify this point we can look at some examples. Writing semantic HTML means using the HTML tags as they were designed to be used - to convey the meaning of a particular document structure or textual element. So a good example is when we want to encode the main heading in a page I would use the H1 tag:</p>\n<p>This seems obvious, but in some cases, an author might decide that the default rendering of the H1 tag is too big, so rather than using CSS to define an alternate style, they use the H2 tag instead.</p>\n<p>This may seem harmless, after all we've still marked up this text as a heading. The problem is that we've lost the information that this is the main heading in the page that was conveyed by the H1 tag.</p>\n<p>Even worse, I could use the B (bold) tag and the now deprecated FONT tag to make my text look like a heading:</p>\n<p>In this case the appearance might be ok but the markup is not appropriate for the task. The author's focus has been on the appearance rather than the meaning of the markup; we could say that the author is overstepping their responsibilities a little - the appearance of the text should be the domain of the designer. If the heading is encoded as in this example, the designer will not be able to re-style the headings in a robust way (we could apply a style to bold paragraphs but that would also apply to any other use of this markup in the text).</p>\n<p>The example illustrates the importance of using an appropriate markup tag where one exists. In the case of a heading, this is pretty clear but other parts of the document might need a bit of thought to see what markup is appropriate. One common issue is whether to use a TABLE for some information that you want to appear as a list or array. TABLE is meant for data that has columns and rows, for example, the results of a survey or test scores for a class of students.</p>\n<p>While it is less common these days, the most frequent mis-use of tables is as a means of laying out all or part of a page as a rectangular grid. You may still see this in the navigation links on a page which the designer might want to appear in a row near the top of the page or a column down the side. Semantically this is a list and should really be marked up as such. If a table-like appearance is needed then CSS rules can be used to acheive this (eg. display: table-row).</p>\n<p>TABLE is sometimes used for things that might be more appropriately marked up as lists, eg. using UL (unordered list), OL (ordered list) or DL (description list) tags. An example might be the list of ingredients for a recipe; you might be tempted to encode it as a table because you want the quantities to be lined up in a column on the left. It might be appropriate to use TABLE here but a bit of reflection might tell you that it's really an unordered list - for example you might note that while there's usually a quantity for each ingredient it's not always the case ('salt to taste') so this isn't really columns of data, just list items that might have a distinguished field.</p>\n<p>A final example might be the description of a staff member in an online directory, the commonly contains entries for name, office, phone number, email address etc and it might seem natural to encode this as a table if you want a nice neat layout. However, in this case there is more appropriate markup in the DL (description list) tag. Each entry in a description list contains two parts DT (description title) and DD (description data) which are used to mark up the property name and value:</p>\n<p>Some authors are put off the description list because of the default style that is associated with it which puts the DT and DD parts on different lines. However, changing this is very easy with CSS so it really should be used for information that is structured in this way.</p>\n<p>Using the right semantic markup <em>adds</em> information to the text that can be used by the designer to enhance the communicative power of the web page. Using a consistent style for headings makes it easier for a reader to see the structure of a page and understand it. Similarly, I can use inline tags for things like <em>emphasis</em> (EM), Abbrv. (abbreviations, ABBR), “a quotation” (Q) or <strong>a strongly emphasised point</strong> (STRONG). Each of these has a default style (or in some cases like ABBR, is just the same as the default text style) but can be re-styled by the designer to achieve a particular look and feel. If these elements are used consistently throughout a text, the overall readability of the text can be greatly improved.</p>\n<p>Another motivation for using semantic markup is for users who cannot read via a normal web browser. Blind people make use software that reads out the content of a web page; if the page uses the appropriate semantic markup then the software can make use of this to present the content more appropriately to the user. This might include using the headings to provide a summary of the page or the emphasis tags to generate an appropriate intonation pattern. You might also think about the difference in reading out a list vs. a table of data - that might be a useful way of choosing between the two for a particular part of your page.</p>\n<h3>Exercises</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find an appropriate HTML tag to mark up the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the name of a book that you are citing in an essay</li>\n<li>a fragment of computer code, eg. a bit of Python</li>\n<li>an abbreviation or acronym and it's expansion (e.g. HTML - Hypertext Markup language)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Extending the Semantics of HTML</h2>\n<p>The tag set defined by the HTML standard supports a wide range of content and was designed to cover the most common document structures and entities that appear on the web. However, the designers of HTML couldn't forsee everything that you might want to mark in your documents and so an extension mechanism is included such that you can effectively add new semantics to existing tags. This is the HTML class attribute which allows you to enter a user defined class for any tag. It is effectively a specialisation of any tag that can be used to encode special meanings for your documents.</p>\n<p>The class attribute is meant to contain one or more class identifiers which are single words that mean something to your application. They can be applied to any HTML tag. An example might be the use of the class important to mark something as important in some way. I can add this to a paragraph or a list item:</p>\n<p>In this example, the class attribute is specialising the meaning of the main HTML tag so that we can differentiate important paragraphs and list items from others. We might want to do this so that we can highlight them in some way in the final presentation of the text. In this way, the designer can make the decision about how to emphasise this text (maybe differently on desktop and mobile devices) and the author is free just to decide which things are important. The alternative in this case might have been to use an emphasis EM tag around the text we wanted to emphasise. The advantage of the class attribute is that we identify the whole paragraph or list item as important and we are able to differentiate different kinds of emphasis. This might be useful where, for example, there are some things that are 'important' and others that are 'critical' in a set of instructions. The use of class attributes means that we can transfer the concepts that mean something in the domain of the document directly into the HTML code and then allow the designer to make decisions about how the different ideas are expressed visually.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there isn't an HTML tag that really fits what you are trying to express; in these cases you can use the generic DIV and SPAN tags along with a class attribute. For example, it has been common to use a series of DIV tags to denote the overall structure of a web page:</p>\n<p>This pattern allows the designer to write a stylesheet that places each section at the right place on the page with the right fonts, colours etc. This pattern has become so common that the new HTML5 standard has included new tags named after some of these classes, so you can now write:</p>\n<p>This is part of the evolution of the HTML language; the observation that some kinds of structure are being used very widely leading to the introduction of new elements that properly convey the semantics that are required.</p>\n<p>One final note about the use of classes to convey new semantics. It is possible to use more than one class name where that is appropriate to convey more specialisations. For example, all of the code examples in this text are marked up as PRE tags with the class code and another class to denote the language the code is written in, so on this page I have examples like:</p>\n<p>Note that I have to encode the HTML markup as entity references using the &#x26; notation so that they appear correctly when you view them in the web browser (view source to check this out). Having more than one class name means that I can apply standard styling to code examples and special style for different languages. It also means that I could write a script to pull out all of the examples in a given language if I wanted to check their syntax etc.</p>\n<h1>A View of HTML\n\n</h1>\n<p>Rather than being a chapter that will teach you the HTML language this will be a chapter about the language, how it works, why it has the structures it does and what you should and shouldn't do with it.</p>\n<p>Most people will know some HTML by now (assuming you've been studying computing for a while or have a general interest in the web). My task here is not to teach you HTML or act as a reference for the language, there are plenty of resources around that will do this. Some examples are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp\">w3schools HTML tutorial</a> w3schools is one of the most widely used tutorial and reference sites on the web for HTML and other web technologies.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/html\">Learn HTML</a> from the Mozilla Developer Network, the organisation that produces the Firefox browser. This page has pointers to a number of HTML tutorials and resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About HTML</h2>\n<p>HTML is a <em>markup language</em>, which is a formal language used to add encode structured documents, often by mixing formal elements and plain text. Another example is the LaTeX language used to typeset scientific and technical documents. Here's a fragment of LaTeX that shows the use of commands preceded by a backslash character and curly braces to enclose text:</p>\n<p>These commands are interpreted by the LaTeX system which uses then to produce nicely typeset PDF output. Markup can also be used to identify regions of text for analysis. Here's an example from a language corpus used to study human interaction:</p>\n<p>In this example, special character sequences are used to mark things like speaker turns, pauses, phrases and overlapping speech. This markup can be used to help analyse the language and find examples of certain linguistic phenomena (for example, find me examples of <em>'you know'</em> and show me what the next person says in response).</p>\n<p>HTML is the <em>Hypertext</em> Markup Language, meaning that it is designed to encode hypertext documents - that is, documents containing links to other documents on the World Wide Web. In fact, the hyperlink is just a small part of HTML and much more interesting are all the other parts of the language that allows us to produce useful documents for the web.</p>\n<p>HTML is based on an earlier standard called SGML (Standard Generalised Markup language) which had a successor called XML (eXtensible Markup Language). SGML and XML are both languages for defining markup languages, that is they define the syntax of a markup language but allow you to develop your own language for a specific purpose. The syntax is the angle brackets containing start and end tags &#x3C;p> and &#x3C;/p> that you will be familiar with (and a number of other rules). SGML and XML based languages all use this same syntax but allow the language designer to make up their own tags and define how they should be used together. HTML was designed originally by Tim Berners-Lee and later by the W3C as a language to encode pages of content for the web.</p>\n<p>Importantly, HTML is a <em>markup language</em> not a <em>programming language</em>. The job of a markup language is to record the structure of a document; that structure can then be interpreted by a program to generate some output. A programming language contains instructions that will be executed (or interpreted) to carry out some action or compute some result.</p>\n<h2>Versions of HTML</h2>\n<p>The first version of HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee as part of his World Wide Web project along with the HTTP protocol and the URL syntax. At first it was a very simple language for encoding articles and so had tags for headings, paragraphs, lists etc. Later, the language evolved to encompas new features in the browser such as the ability to display images, tables and modify the font that text was displayed in. The evolution of HTML has been quite gradual and at times part of intense competition between browser vendors (look up the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars\">Browser Wars</a> to get the full story). The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and later the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) tried to standardise the language but it took some time for industry practice to align with the W3C standards. Luckily now we are in a period of relative stability where the standards process aligns well with what the major browsers are able to understand.</p>\n<p>A version of HTML is defined by a Document Type Definintion (DTD) - a formal definition of the allowed tags and attributes and the allowed structure of an HTML document. The DTD says that you can have a &#x3C;p> tag and that it can contain a &#x3C;strong> tag but that a &#x3C;li> has to be inside a &#x3C;ul> or &#x3C;ol> tag and so on. If a document conforms to the DTD (follows the rules) we say that it is <em>valid</em>, if it contains errors such as having an unknown tag or a tag in the wrong place it is invalid.</p>\n<p>Early versions of HTML were subject to a lot of change and it wasn't until HTML version 4.0.1, released in 1999 that there was a bit of stability in the language and consensus about what should be included and what should be left out. Before then, HTML had grown to contain a lot of <em>visual</em> markup that had been developed by the browser vendors (Netscape and Microsoft) to try to make their browser look better than the competition. An example is the &#x3C;font> tag introduced by Microsoft (and copied by Netscape) which could change the font used to render some text. By the time HTML 4.01 was published, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were becoming more widely adopted and the use of markup that explicitly referred to the visual appearance of the content was discouraged.</p>\n<p>HTML 4.0.1 is still the latest version of the official W3C standard although there have been a large number of changes implemented by the browser vendors since the time it was released.</p>\n<p>In 1997 the XML standard was introduced. XML was intended to generalise the use of markup on the web and allow developers to design thier own markup languages for specific purposes. XML is an evolution of the earlier SGML standard on which HTML had been based; it simplified the syntax rules a lot and made it easier to write parsers for XML. One of the early applications of XML was to develop XHTML - a version of HTML converted to adhere to the XML standard. XHTML 1.0 retained almost all of the tags in HTML 4.0.1 but introduced the constraints of XML. For example in an XML document every opening tag must have a corresponding close tag; in HTML, many close tags are optional (e.g. you can leave out the closing &#x3C;p> tag for a paragraph since it is implied by the next opening &#x3C;p> tag) and many tags never have a close tag because they never contain any text (e.g. &#x3C;img> or &#x3C;br>). In XHTML then, paragraphs always require a close tag and empty tags are written with the new XML syntax: &#x3C;br />.</p>\n<p>One of the motivations for introducing XHTML was to try to encourage web developers to adhere more closely to the published standards. The web had grown up with a culture of view-source where people would learn how to encode web pages by looking at the source HTML of other web pages rather than by reading the standard. They would then write their own pages and if they looked ok in the browser, they would publish them. To cope with the amount of badly formed HTML content on the web, the browser vendors built thier HTML parsers to be very forgiving. If you put a paragraph inside an image tag or a header inside a paragraph it would have a go at rendering the content. As a consequence, very few web publishers cared about generating proper HTML and anyone who wanted to parse web content had to make very few assumptions about HTML structure.</p>\n<p>Around this time there was a move towards having more automated clients consuming web content. One group was the search engine developers who were just interested in the textual content of pages but other groups were trying to glean real data from the web. For example, price comparison services were starting up which tried to extract pricing information from store listings. Other services might try to find event information from web pages. All of these services needed to parse the HTML structure and had problems when the HTML was badly structured; this became known as <a href=\"http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/whatIsTagSoup\">Tag Soup</a> since one could not rely on proper HTML structure it was just treated as an unstructured collection of tagged text. Permissive parsers such as <a href=\"http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/\">Beautiful Soup</a> (Python) and <a href=\"http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/\">Tagsoup</a> (Java) were developed to cope with the messy markup and give the developer as much detail as possible from the page.</p>\n<h1>HTML5</h1>\n<p>The most recent version of HTML is HTML5 - note the name with no spaces which is quite different to earlier versions. HTML5 was a big change in the way that the standard was put together and followed a long break in the development of standards for HTML: HTML 4.0.1 was last updated in 2000, HTML5 was finally released in 2012. The goal of HTML5 was to standardise current practice in browsers, rather than to define new structures or limit what was possible. The W3C worked with the browser developers to agree on standards for new technologies that they had introduced. For example, being able to include audio and video elements in HTML had been possible in some browsers; HTML5 defined a standard for these that all browser vendors could agree on and implement.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/semantic/","relativePath":"docs/articles/semantic.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"semantic.md","name":"semantic","frontmatter":{"title":"Semantic Versioning","sections":[],"seo":{"title":"","description":"Semantic Versioning using npm","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>If there's one great thing in Node.js packages, it's that they all agreed on using Semantic Versioning for their version numbering.</p>\n<p>The Semantic Versioning concept is simple: all versions have 3 digits: <code>x.y.z</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the first digit is the major version</li>\n<li>the second digit is the minor version</li>\n<li>the third digit is the patch version</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you make a new release, you don't just up a number as you please, but you have rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you up the major version when you make incompatible API changes</li>\n<li>you up the minor version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner</li>\n<li>you up the patch version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The convention is adopted all across programming languages, and it is very important that every <code>npm</code> package adheres to it, because the whole system depends on that.</p>\n<p>Why is that so important?</p>\n<p>Because <code>npm</code> set some rules we can use in the <code>package.json</code> file to choose which versions it can update our packages to, when we run <code>npm update</code>.</p>\n<p>The rules use those symbols:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>^</code></li>\n<li><code>~</code></li>\n<li><code>></code></li>\n<li><code>>=</code></li>\n<li><code>&#x3C;</code></li>\n<li><code>&#x3C;=</code></li>\n<li><code>=</code></li>\n<li><code>-</code></li>\n<li><code>||</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's see those rules in detail:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>^</code>: It will only do updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero number.

This will work when you type it into your web browser because the browser will assume you meant this as an HTTP URL. However, if we are being pedantic, the prefix is required as it tells us something about the web address - that we should use the HTTP protocol to access it.</p>\n<p>URLs are not only useful for HTTP addresses. Other <em>schemes</em> are allowed and they tell the client how to get access to the content that the URL describes. The most common you will see is https:// which is the secure variant of HTTP (we'll find out about that later). HTTPS uses the same protocol as HTTP but over a secure connection so that information that is exchanged can't be intercepted. Another scheme is ftp:// which tells the browser to use the older FTP protocol to access the content. Finally, you might see a mailto URL which allows us to write a link that triggers the browser to start composing an email message. This has a slightly different form: <a href=\"mailto:Steve.Cassidy@mq.edu.au\">Steve.Cassidy@mq.edu.au</a> but it's still a URL. In fact, the pattern looks like this:</p>\n<p>For the HTTP scheme the pattern is:</p>\n<p>The first part &#x3C;net_loc> is the network location of the resource: the domain name of the web server that holds the web page we want. This is preceded by two forward slashes and followed by a single forward slash. Then follows the &#x3C;path> which the server will use to identify which page we want. The ;&#x3C;params>?&#x3C;query>#&#x3C;fragment> are used to further qualify the resource that we want; we'll see some examples of how they are used later in the book.</p>\n<p>The URL is a unique form of identifier in that it has two roles. First, it identifies a document, video or music file that's out on the web (we call these things <em>resources</em>). Each resource has a unique URL and you can refer to them via the URL. If we two people refer to the same URL, then they know they have read the same document. Secondly, the URL contains enough information for a web client to retrieve a copy of the resource. The client can use the scheme defined (HTTP) to connect to the server and send an HTTP request for the path part of the URL.</p>\n<p>There are other kinds of formal identifier that don't have this second property. For example, every book has an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) which uniquely identifies it. However, the ISBN contains no information about how to get a copy of the book. To do so, you'd need to look up the ISBN in a catalogue which might tell you who the publisher was and then contact them for a copy. Alternately you could go to a book-shop or library and use their catalogue to find the book. With a URL, there's no need for a catalogue or third party service to decode the identifier. The information on how to retrieve the resource is right there in the Uniform Resource Locator.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/\">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> is as close as we get to a governing body for the Internet and it's home to many of the standards that define how the Internet and the Web work. The standards documents are called <em>Request for Comments</em> or RFC, a name which reflects the democratic nature of the early Internet. <a href=\"http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2068/\">RFC2068</a> defines HTTP version 1.1 and <a href=\"http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc1738/\">RFC1738</a> defines the URL. Look out also for <a href=\"http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc2324/\">RFC2324</a> which can be relevant after a long coding session.</p>\n<h2>Uniform Resource Identifiers</h2>\n<p>There's another similar term that is sometimes used instead of URL: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). URI is actually a more general term that includes URLs and Universal Resource Names (URNs). URNs are identifiers that don't contain any locator information such as the ISBN. They have a formal syntax so I can cite a particular ISBN as a URN as URN:ISBN:978-0-395-36341-6 (an example from the <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-urnbis-rfc3187bis-isbn-urn-01\">IETF RFC3187</a> document that defines the standard). As explained above, we need a third party service to resolve a URN into a real location (a URL). You might see the term URI used in discussions of web technologies; it is often used instead of URL but generally means the same thing if we're talking about HTTP based services.</p>\n<p>Since URLs are both names and addresses it becomes important that once you put a resource on the web, it stays there. This is discussed in Tim Berners-Lee's paper called \"<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI\">Cool URIs don't change</a>\". It's a principle that all web designers should bear in mind as it is easy to violate as we re-build old web-sites.</p>\n<h2>Absolute and relative URLs</h2>\n<p>When we include a URL in a web page there are a number of choices about how it can be written. The first option is to include the full URL:</p>\n<p>This is clearly a link to a resource on the server at <em>example.org</em> using the http protocol. However, if this page is being served by the server at <em>example.org</em> then we could also write this link as:</p>\n<p>This is known as a <em>relative URL</em> and is interpreted relative to the URL of the page that is currently being viewed. Let's assume that this page is at the URL <a href=\"http://example.org/about/info.html\">http://example.org/about/info.html</a>. Note that the URL above starts with a / character, in this case, the browser will interpret this URL by adding the protocol (http) and domain (example.org) parts of the page URL to this one to get <a href=\"http://example.org/static/style.css\">http://example.org/static/style.css</a>.</p>\n<p>Another way to write a URL is:</p>\n<p>In this case there is no / at the start of the URL and so this is interpreted relative to the page URL by removing everything but the last part of the URL <a href=\"http://example.org/about/\">http://example.org/about/</a> and then adding the new URL text to get <a href=\"http://example.org/about/static/style.css\">http://example.org/about/static/style.css</a>. Note that this is different to the previous example. If the intention was to reference the same URL as before, you could use the URL:</p>\n<p>Here the .. path refers to the parent directory (thinking of these paths as filenames) so the path becomes /about/../static/style.css which can be shortened to /static/style.css.</p>\n<p>The different URL styles have different uses. If you are writing a static HTML page that you will view on your local computer and perhaps host on the web somewhere (but you're not sure where) then you might put all of your files in one directory and use a relative URL like static/style.css to refer to linked resources. This ensures that your directory of files could be dropped anywhere into a web server file system and it would be self-contained and the links would work.</p>\n<p>However, if you are writing a web application that will be hosted on some domain (like example.org) you know that you have control of all URLs on that site and so would more likely use a relative URL starting with a / (like /static/style.css). This is important if your web application has complex routes (eg. pages like /users/steve/profile/edit) and you want to ensure that whatever the page URL being served, the links to stylesheets and other resources will work. The application can be deployed on different servers (like example.org and example.com) and the links will still work because they don't mention the domain name at all.</p>\n<p>Finally, absolute URLs (like <a href=\"http://example.org/static/style.css\">http://example.org/static/style.css</a>) will be used when we know that this URL is fixed at this location. It may be something external to our own site, or something that we know will be hosted at this URL on our site. There is an argument from a Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) viewpoint that all URLs in a website should be absolute urls even when they refer to assets on the same site. The reasons relate to the way that search engines crawl sites and the possible duplication of content if two URLs point to the same page (eg. <a href=\"https://example.org/\">https://example.org/</a> and <a href=\"http://example.org\">http://example.org</a>).</p>\n<p>One final form of relative URL looks like this:</p>\n<p>This URL is only missing the protocol part and is turned into an absolute URL by adding the protocol part of the current page URL. So if the current page was requested over http or https, this URL will use the same protocol. This is often useful if a site can be served over both protocols although it is increasingly the case that https is being used everywhere so this may become less common as time progresses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/\">Share To Facebook:</a></p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/understanding-firebase/","relativePath":"docs/articles/understanding-firebase.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"understanding-firebase.md","name":"understanding-firebase","frontmatter":{"title":"Firebase","weight":0,"excerpt":"Firebasics","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>Understand Firebase projects</h1>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're using the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest?authuser=0\">Firebase Management REST API</a> to programmatically create a Firebase project, you must first <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects?authuser=0\">create a Google Cloud project</a>, then <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects/addFirebase?authuser=0\">add Firebase services</a> to the existing project.<strong>Note:</strong> The <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-number\">project number</a> and the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-id\">project ID</a> are the truly <em>unique identifiers</em> for a project across all of Firebase and Google Cloud.<strong>After Firebase provisions resources for a Firebase project, you cannot change its project ID.</strong> To use a specific identifier for Firebase resources, you must edit the project ID during the initial creation of the project.<strong>Caution:</strong> We do not recommend manually modifying an app's Firebase config file or object.

In a project, you create Firebase apps by registering your iOS, Android, or web apps. After you register your apps with Firebase, you can add the Firebase SDKs for any number of <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/?authuser=0\">Firebase products</a>, like Analytics, Cloud Firestore, Performance Monitoring, or Remote Config.</p>\n<p>Learn more detailed information about this process in the Getting Started guides (<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup?authuser=0\">iOS</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?authuser=0\">Android</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0\">web</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup?authuser=0\">Unity</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cpp/setup?authuser=0\">C++</a>).</p>\n<h2>Relationship between Firebase projects and Google Cloud</h2>\n<p>When you create a new Firebase project in the Firebase console, you're actually creating a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/?authuser=0#projects\">Google Cloud project</a> behind the scenes. You can think of a Google Cloud project as a virtual container for data, code, configuration, and services. <strong>A Firebase project is a Google Cloud project that has additional Firebase-specific configurations and services.</strong> You can even create a Google Cloud project first, then add Firebase to the project later.</p>\n<p>Since a Firebase project <strong><em>is</em></strong> a Google Cloud project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Projects that appear in the <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/?authuser=0\">Firebase console</a> also appear in the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/?authuser=0#google-cloud-console\">Google Cloud Console</a> and <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/?authuser=0\">Google APIs console</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/pricing/?authuser=0\">Billing</a> and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/iam/overview?authuser=0\">permissions</a> for projects are shared across Firebase and Google Cloud.</li>\n<li>Unique identifiers for a project (like the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-number\">project number</a> and the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-id\">project ID</a>) are shared across Firebase and Google Cloud.</li>\n<li>You can use products and APIs from both Firebase and Google Cloud in a project.</li>\n<li>Deleting a project deletes it across Firebase and Google Cloud.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting up a Firebase project and registering apps</h2>\n<p>You can set up a Firebase project and register apps in the <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/?authuser=0\">Firebase console</a> (or, for advanced use cases, via the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest?authuser=0\">Firebase Management REST API</a> or the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#management-commands\">Firebase CLI</a>). When you set up a project and register apps, you need to make some organizational decisions and add Firebase-specific configuration information to your local projects.</p>\n<p>Make sure to review some <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#best-practices\">general project-level best practices</a> (at the bottom of this page) before setting up a project and registering apps.</p>\n<h3>The project name</h3>\n<p>When you create a project, you provide a <strong>project name</strong>. This identifier is the <em>internal-only name</em> for a project in the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#manage-console\">Firebase console</a>, the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview/?authuser=0#google-cloud-console\">Google Cloud Console</a>, and the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#manage-cli\">Firebase CLI</a>. The project name is not exposed in any publicly visible Firebase or Google Cloud product, service, or resource; it simply serves to help you more easily distinguish among multiple projects.</p>\n<p>You can edit a project name at any time in the settings <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/?authuser=0\"><strong>Project settings</strong></a> of the Firebase console. The project name is displayed in the top pane.</p>\n<h3>The project number</h3>\n<p>A Firebase project (and its <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#firebase-cloud-relationship\">associated Google Cloud project</a>) has a <strong>project number</strong>. This is the Google-assigned globally unique canonical identifier for the project. Use this identifier when configuring integrations and/or making API calls to Firebase, Google, or third-party services.</p>\n<h4>API calls and the project number</h4>\n<p>For many API calls, you need to include a unique identifier for a project. Although many APIs accept the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-id\">project ID</a>, it's recommended that you use the <strong>project number</strong> for making API calls to Firebase, Google, or third-party services.</p>\n<p>Learn more about using project identifiers, especially the project number, in Google's <a href=\"https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510\">AIP 2510 standard</a>.</p>\n<h4>Find the project number</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Firebase console: Click settings <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/?authuser=0\"><strong>Project settings</strong></a>.

This is a user-defined unique identifier for the project across all of Firebase and Google Cloud. When you create a Firebase project, Firebase automatically assigns a unique ID to the project, but you can edit it during project setup. This identifier should generally be treated as a convenience alias to reference the project.</p>\n<p>If you delete a project, the project ID is also deleted and can never be used again by any other project.</p>\n<h4>Firebase resources and the project ID</h4>\n<p>The project ID displays in publicly visible Firebase resources, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Default Hosting subdomain — <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>.web.app and <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>.firebaseapp.com</li>\n<li>Default Realtime Database URL — <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com or <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>-default-rtdb.<strong>REGION_CODE</strong>.firebasedatabase.app</li>\n<li>Default Cloud Storage bucket name — <strong>PROJECT_ID</strong>.appspot.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all of the aforementioned resources, you can create non-default instances. The publicly visible names of non-defaults are fully-customizable. You can <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/custom-domain?authuser=0\">connect custom domains</a> to a Firebase-hosted site, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/usage/sharding?authuser=0\">shard the Realtime Database</a>, and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage?authuser=0\">create multiple Cloud Storage buckets</a> (visit the platform-specific Get Started page).</p>\n<h4>The Firebase CLI and the project ID</h4>\n<p>For some use cases, you might have multiple Firebase projects associated with the same local app directory. In these situations, when you use the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#manage-cli\">Firebase CLI</a>, you need to pass the --project flag with the firebase commands to communicate which Firebase project you want to interact with.</p>\n<p>You can also set up a <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#project_aliases\">project alias</a> for each Firebase project so that you don't have to remember project IDs.</p>\n<h4>API calls and the project ID</h4>\n<p>For many API calls, you need to include a unique identifier for a project. Although many APIs accept the project ID, it's recommended that you use the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-number\"><strong>project number</strong></a> for making API calls to Firebase, Google, or third-party services.</p>\n<p>Learn more about using project identifiers, especially the project number, in Google's <a href=\"https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510\">AIP 2510 standard</a>.</p>\n<h4>Find the project ID</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Firebase console: Click settings <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/?authuser=0\"><strong>Project settings</strong></a>.

The configuration includes \"Firebase options\", which are parameters required by Firebase and Google services to communicate with Firebase server APIs and to associate client data with the Firebase project and Firebase app. Here are the required, minimum \"Firebase options\":</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys?authuser=0\"><strong>API key</strong></a>: a simple encrypted string used when calling certain APIs that don't need to access private user data (example value: AIzaSyDOCAbC123dEf456GhI789jKl012-MnO)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#project-id\"><strong>Project ID</strong></a>: a user-defined unique identifier for the project across all of Firebase and Google Cloud. This identifier may appear in URLs or names for some Firebase resources, but it should generally be treated as a convenience alias to reference the project. (example value: myapp-project-123)</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Application ID (\"AppID\")</strong>: the unique identifier for the Firebase app across all of Firebase with a platform-specific format:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firebase iOS apps: GOOGLE<em>APP</em>ID (example value: 1:1234567890:ios:321abc456def7890)\nThis is <em>not</em> an Apple bundle ID.</li>\n<li>Firebase Android apps: mobilesdk<em>app</em>id (example value: 1:1234567890:android:321abc456def7890)\nThis is <em>not</em> an Android package name or Android application ID.</li>\n<li>Firebase Web apps: appId (example value: 1:65211879909:web:3ae38ef1cdcb2e01fe5f0c)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The content of the Firebase config file or object is considered public, including the app's platform-specific ID (iOS bundle ID or Android package name) and the Firebase project-specific values, like the API Key, project ID, Realtime Database URL, and Cloud Storage bucket name. Given this, <strong>use Firebase Security Rules</strong> to protect your data and files in <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security?authuser=0\">Realtime Database</a>, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started?authuser=0\">Cloud Firestore</a>, and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/security?authuser=0\">Cloud Storage</a>.</p>\n<p>For open source projects, we generally do not recommend including the app's Firebase config file or object in source control because, in most cases, your users should create their own Firebase projects and point their apps to their own Firebase resources (via their own Firebase config file or object).</p>\n<h2>Managing a Firebase project</h2>\n<p>Make sure to review the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#best-practices\">general project-level best practices</a> (at the bottom of this page) for considerations that might affect how you manage a Firebase project.</p>\n<h3>Tools to manage a project</h3>\n<h4>Firebase console</h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/?authuser=0\">Firebase console</a> offers the richest environment for managing Firebase products, apps, and project-level settings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/images/firebase_console_overview.png?authuser=0\"></p>\n<p>The left-side panel of the console lists the Firebase products, organized by top-level categories. At the top of the left-side panel, access a project's settings by clicking settings. A project's settings include <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/integrations?authuser=0\">integrations</a>, <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/iam/overview?authuser=0\">access permissions</a>, and <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/pricing?authuser=0\">billing</a>.</p>\n<p>The middle of the console displays buttons that launch setup workflows to register various types of apps. After you start using Firebase, the main area of the console changes into a dashboard that displays stats on the products you use.</p>\n<h4>Firebase CLI (a command line tool)</h4>\n<p>Firebase also offers the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0\">Firebase CLI</a> for configuring and managing specific Firebase products, like Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions for Firebase.</p>\n<p>After installing the CLI, you have access to the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#command_reference\">global firebase command</a>. Use the CLI to <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#initialize_a_firebase_project\">link your local app directory to a Firebase project</a>, then <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#deployment\">deploy</a> new versions of Firebase-hosted content or updates to functions.</p>\n<h4>Firebase Management REST API</h4>\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest?authuser=0\">Firebase Management REST API</a>, you can programmatically manage a Firebase project. For example, you can programmatically register an app with a project or list the apps that are already registered (<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.iosApps?authuser=0#methods\">iOS</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.androidApps?authuser=0#methods\">Android</a> | <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.webApps?authuser=0#methods\">web</a>).</p>\n<h2>General best practices</h2>\n<h3>Adding apps to a project</h3>\n<p><strong>Ensure that all apps within a project are platform variants of the same application</strong> from an end-user perspective. It's advisable to register the iOS, Android, and web versions of the same app or game with the same Firebase project. All the apps in a project generally share the same Firebase resources (database, storage buckets, etc.).</p>\n<p>If you have <strong><em>multiple build variants</em></strong> with different iOS bundle IDs or Android package names defined, you can register each variant with a separate Firebase project. However, if you have variants that share the <em>same</em> Firebase resources, register them with the <em>same</em> Firebase project.</p>\n<p>Here are some general limits for Firebase projects, apps, and sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of projects per account</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spark pricing plan — Project-creation quota is limited to a lower count of projects (usually around 5-10).</li>\n<li>Blaze pricing plan — Project-creation quota per account increases substantially as long as the associated Cloud Billing account is in good standing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The limit on project-creation quota is rarely a concern for most developers, but if needed, you can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6330231?authuser=0\">request an increase in project quota</a>.</p>\n<p>Be aware that the complete deletion of a project requires 30 days and counts toward project quota until the project is fully deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of apps per project</strong></p>\n<p>Firebase restricts the total number of Firebase Apps within a Firebase project to 30.</p>\n<p>You should ensure that all Firebase Apps within a single Firebase project are platform variants of the same application from an end-user perspective. Read more about best practices for <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more?authuser=0#multi-tenancy\">multi-tenancy</a> below.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/support/faq?authuser=0#apps-per-project\">limit on apps per project</a> in the FAQ.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Number of Hosting sites per project</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/multisites?authuser=0\">Firebase Hosting multisite feature</a> supports a maximum of 36 sites per project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Multi-tenancy</h3>\n<p>Connecting several different logically independent apps and/or web sites to a single Firebase project (often called \"multi-tenancy\") is not recommended. Multi-tenancy can lead to serious configuration and data privacy concerns problems, including unintended issues with analytics aggregation, shared authentication, overly-complex database structures, and difficulties with security rules.</p>\n<p>Generally, <strong>if a set of apps don't share the same data and configurations, strongly consider registering each app with a different Firebase project.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, if you develop a white label application, each independently labelled app should have its own Firebase project, but the iOS and Android versions of that label can be in the same project. Each independently labeled app shouldn't (for privacy reasons) share data with the others.</p>\n<h2>Launching your app</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/billing/avoid-surprise-bills?authuser=0#set-up-budget-alert-emails\">budget alerts</a> for your project in the Google Cloud Console.</li>\n<li>Monitor the <a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/usage?authuser=0\"><em>Usage and billing</em> dashboard</a> in the Firebase console to get an overall picture of your project's usage across multiple Firebase services.</li>\n<li>Review the <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/launch-checklist?authuser=0\">Firebase launch checklist</a>.</li>\n</ul>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/v8/","relativePath":"docs/articles/v8.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"v8.md","name":"v8","frontmatter":{"title":"npm global or local packages","weight":0,"excerpt":"npm packages","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>The main difference between local and global packages is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>local packages</strong> are installed in the directory where you run npm install &#x3C;package-name>, and they are put in the node_modules folder under this directory</li>\n<li><strong>global packages</strong> are all put in a single place in your system (exactly where depends on your setup), regardless of where you run npm install -g &#x3C;package-name></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In your code you can only require local packages:</p>\n<p>so when should you install in one way or another?</p>\n<p>In general, <strong>all packages should be installed locally</strong>.</p>\n<p>This makes sure you can have dozens of applications in your computer, all running a different version of each package if needed.</p>\n<p>Updating a global package would make all your projects use the new release, and as you can imagine this might cause nightmares in terms of maintenance, as some packages might break compatibility with further dependencies, and so on.</p>\n<p>All projects have their own local version of a package, even if this might appear like a waste of resources, it's minimal compared to the possible negative consequences.</p>\n<p>A package <strong>should be installed globally</strong> when it provides an executable command that you run from the shell (CLI), and it's reused across projects.</p>\n<p>You can also install executable commands locally and run them using npx, but some packages are just better installed globally.</p>\n<p>Great examples of popular global packages which you might know are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>npm</li>\n<li>create-react-app</li>\n<li>vue-cli</li>\n<li>grunt-cli</li>\n<li>mocha</li>\n<li>react-native-cli</li>\n<li>gatsby-cli</li>\n<li>forever</li>\n<li>nodemon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You probably have some packages installed globally already on your system.

A site built to web standards should <em>adhere to standards</em> (HTML, XHTML, XML, CSS, XSLT, DOM, MathML, SVG etc) and <em>pursue best practices</em> (valid code, accessible code, semantically correct code, user-friendly URLs etc).</p>\n<p>In other words, a site built to web standards should ideally be <em>lean, clean, CSS-based, accessible, usable and search engine friendly</em>.</p>\n<h3>About the checklist</h3>\n<p>This is a guide that can be used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to show the breadth of web standards</li>\n<li>as a handy tool for developers during the

Quality of code</h3>\n<h4>1.1 Does the site use a correct Doctype?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A doctype (short for 'document type declaration') informs the validator which version of (X)HTML you're using, and must appear at the very top of every web page. Doctypes are a key component of compliant web pages: your markup and CSS won't validate without them.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/doctype/\">Fix your site with the right doctype</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html\">http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/about-boxmodel.htm\">http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/about-boxmodel.htm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gutfeldt.ch/matthias/articles/doctypeswitch.html\">http://gutfeldt.ch/matthias/articles/doctypeswitch.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.2 Does the site use a Character set?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a user agent (eg. a browser) is unable to detect the character encoding used in a Web document, the user may be presented with unreadable text. This information is particularly important for those maintaining and extending a multilingual site, but  declaring the character encoding of the document is important for anyone producing XHTML/HTML or CSS.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/\">Tutorial: Character sets &#x26; encodings in XHTML, HTML and CSS</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/International/O-charset.html\">Character encodings</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.3 Does the site use Valid (X)HTML?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Valid code will render faster than code with errors. Valid code will render better than invalid code. Browsers are becoming more standards compliant, and it is becoming increasingly necessary to write valid and standards compliant HTML</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/\">W3C Markup Validation Service</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.4 Does the site use Valid CSS?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You need to make sure that there aren't any errors in either your HTML or your CSS, since mistakes in either place can result in botched document appearance.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/articles/webrev/199904.html\">Help!

Specifically, the HTML code tends to be full of unnecessary divs and ids. This results in fairly meaningless HTML and bloated style sheets.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.clagnut.com/blog/228/\">Markup tactics</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>1.7 Is the code well structured?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Semantically correct markup uses html elements for their given purpose. Well structured HTML has semantic meaning for a wide range of user agents (browsers without style sheets, text browsers, PDAs, search engines etc.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/12/semantic-extractor.html\">Semantic data extractor</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.8 Does the site have any broken links?</h4>\n<p>Broken links can frustrate users and potentially drive customers away. Broken links can also keep search engines from properly indexing your site.</p>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/checklink\">W3C Link checker</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.9 How does the site perform in terms of speed/page size?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't make me wait... That's the message users give us in survey after survey. Even broadband users can suffer the slow-loading blues.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/\">Speed Up Your Site: Web Site Optimization</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>1.10 Does the site have JavaScript errors?</h4>\n<p>Internet Explore for Windows allows you to turn on a debugger that will pop up a new window and let you know there are javascript errors on your site. This is available under 'Internet Options' on the Advanced tab. Uncheck 'Disable script debugging'.</p>\n<h3>2. Degree of separation between content and presentation</h3>\n<h4>2.1 Does the site use CSS for all presentation aspects (fonts, colour, padding, borders etc)?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use style sheets to control layout and presentation</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-style-sheets\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 -- checkpoint 3.3</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>2.2 Are all decorative images in the CSS, or do they appear in the (X)HTML?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The aim for web developers is to remove all presentation from the html code, leaving it clean and semantically correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>3. Accessibility for users</h3>\n<h4>3.1 Are \"alt\" attributes used for all descriptive images?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-text-equivalent\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines -- checkpoint 1.1</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>3.2 Does the site use relative units rather than absolute units for text size?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language attribute values and style sheet property values'</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-relative-units\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines -- checkpoint 3.4</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-relative-units\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines -- checkpoint 3.4</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.clagnut.com/blog/348/\">How to size text using ems</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.3 Do any aspects of the layout break if font size is increased?</h4>\n<p>Try this simple test. Look at your website in a browser that supports easy incrementation of font size. Now increase your browser's font size. And again. And again... Look at your site. Does the page layout still hold together? It is dangerous for developers to assume that everyone browses using default font sizes.</p>\n<h4>3.4 Does the site use visible skip menus?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&#x26;ID=12\">Section 508</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Group related links, identify the group (for user agents), and, until user agents do so, provide a way to bypass the group</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-TECHS/#tech-group-links\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines -- checkpoint 13.6</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...blind visitors are not the only ones inconvenienced by too many links in a navigation area.

Navigating around a page with written content is one thing, hopping between form fields and inputting information is another</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.htmldog.com/guides/htmladvanced/forms/\">Accessible forms</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.webstandards.org/learn/tutorials/accessible-forms/01-accessible-forms.html\">Accessible html/xhtml forms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/accessible-form-builder.asp\">Accessible form builder</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.6 Does the site use accessible tables?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For data tables, identify row and column headers... For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-table-headers\">Web Content Accessiblity Guidelines -- checkpoint 5.1</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://bellevuecollege.edu/webpublishing/tips/accessibility/tables.asp\">How to create accessible tables</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.accessify.com/tools-and-wizards/accessibility-tools/table-builder/\">Accessible table builder</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.webaim.org/techniques/tables/\">Creating accessible tables</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.7 Is there sufficient colour brightness/contrasts?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ensure that foreground and background colour combinations provide sufficient contrast when viewed by someone having colour deficits</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT-TECHS/#tech-color-contrast\">Web Content Accessibilty Guidelines -- checkpoint 2.2</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.juicystudio.com/services/colourcontrast.asp\">Colour Contrast Analyser</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.8 Is colour alone used for critical information?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ensure that all information conveyed with colour is also available without colour, for example from context or markup</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-color-convey\">Web Content Accessibilty Guidelines -- checkpoint 2.1</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are basically three types of colour deficiency; Deuteranope (a form of red/green colour deficit), Protanope (another form of red/green colour deficit) and Tritanope (a blue/yellow deficit- very rare).</p>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://colorfilter.wickline.org/\">Colourblind Webpage filter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckURL.php\">Vischeck</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3.9 Is there delayed responsiveness for dropdown menus?</h4>\n<p>Users with reduced motor skills may find dropdown menus hard to use if responsiveness is set too fast.</p>\n<h4>3.10 Are all links descriptive?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Link text should be meaningful enough to make sense when read out of context -- either on its own or as part of a sequence of links. Link text should also be terse.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-meaningful-links\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 -- checkpoint 13.1</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>4. Accessibility for devices</h3>\n<h4>4.1 Does the site work acceptably across modern and older browsers?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before starting to build a CSS-based layout, you should decide which browsers to support and to what level you intend to support them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>4.2 Is the content accessible with CSS switched off or not supported?</h4>\n<p>Some people may visit your site with either a browser that does not support CSS or a browser with CSS switched off. In content is structured well, this will not be an issue.</p>\n<h4>4.3 Is the content accessible with images switched off or not supported?</h4>\n<p>Some people browse websites with images switched off -- especially people on very slow connections. Content should still be accessible for these people.</p>\n<h4>4.4 Does the site work in text browsers such as Lynx?</h4>\n<p>This is like a combination of images and CSS switched off. A text-based browser will rely on well structured content to provide meaning.</p>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview\">Lynx Viewer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.5 Does the site work well when printed?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can take any (X)HTML document and simply style it for print, without having to touch the markup.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/\">Going to print</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.d.umn.edu/itss/support/Training/Online/webdesign/css.html#print\">Web Design References -- Print</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4.6 Does the site work well in Hand Held devices?</h4>\n<p>This is a hard one to deal with until hand held devices consistently support their correct media type. However, some layouts work better in current hand-held devices. The importance of supporting hand held devices will depend on target audiences.</p>\n<h4>4.7 Does the site include detailed metadata?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Metadata is machine understandable information for the web</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Metadata/\">W3C -- Metadata and Resource Description</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Metadata is structured information that is created specifically to describe another resource. In other words, metadata is 'data about data'.</p>\n<h4>4.8 Does the site work well in a range of browser window sizes?</h4>\n<p>It is a common assumption amongst developers that average screen sizes are increasing. Some developers assume that the average screen size is now 1024px wide. But what about users with smaller screens and users with hand held devices? Are they part of your target audience and are they being disadvantaged?</p>\n<h3>5. Basic Usability</h3>\n<h4>5.1 Is there a clear visual hierarchy?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Organise and prioritise the contents of a page by using size, prominence and content relationships</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.great-web-design-tips.com/web-site-design/165.html\">Create a Clear Visual Hierarchy</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.2 Are heading levels easy to distinguish?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use header elements to convey document structure and use them according to specification</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#tech-logical-headings\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 -- checkpoint 3.5</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.3 Is the site's navigation easy to understand?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your navigation system should give your visitor a clue as to what page of the site they are currently on and where they can go next.</p>\n<p><em>[Design Tutorial -- Navigation](<a href=\"http://www.1stsitefree.com/design\">http://www.1stsitefree.com/design</a></em>nav.htm)_</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.4 Is the site's navigation consistent?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If each page on your site has a consistent style of presentation, visitors will find it easier to navigate between pages and find information</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.juicystudio.com/tutorial/accessibility/navigation.asp\">Juicy studios -- Navigation</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.5 Does the site use consistent and appropriate language?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The use of clear and simple language promotes effective communication. Trying to come across as articulate can be as difficult to read as poorly written grammar, especially if the language used isn't the visitor's primary language.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.juicystudio.com/tutorial/accessibility/clear.asp\">Clear language</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.6 Does the site have a sitemap page and contact page? Are they  easy to find?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most site maps fail to convey multiple levels of the site's information architecture. In usability tests, users often overlook site maps or can't find them. Complexity is also a problem: a map should be a map, not a navigational challenge of its own.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20020106.html\">Site Map Usability</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.7 For large sites, is there a search tool?</h4>\n<p>While search tools are not needed on smaller sites, and some people will not ever use them, site-specific search tools allow users a choice of navigation options.</p>\n<h4>5.8 Is there a link to the home page on every page in the site?</h4>\n<p>Some users like to go back to a site's home page after navigating to content within a site. The home page becomes a base camp for these users, allowing them to regroup before exploring new content.</p>\n<h4>5.9 Are links underlined?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To maximise the <a href=\"http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordances-and-design.html\">perceived affordance</a> of clickability, colour and underline the link text. Users shouldn't have to guess or scrub the page to find out where they can click.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040510.html\">Guidelines for Visualizing Links</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>5.10 Are visited links clearly defined?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most important, knowing which pages they've already visited frees users from unintentionally revisiting the same pages over and over again.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040503.html\">Change the Color of Visited Links</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>6. Site management</h3>\n<h4>6.1 Does the site have a meaningful and helpful 404 error page that works from any depth in the site?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You've requested a page -- either by typing a URL directly into the address bar or clicking on an out-of-date link and you've found yourself in the middle of cyberspace nowhere. A user-friendly website will give you a helping hand while many others will simply do nothing, relying on the browser's built-in ability to explain what the problem is.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.alistapart.com/articles/perfect404/\">The perfect 404</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>6.2 Does the site use friendly URLs?</h4>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most search engines (with a few exceptions -- namely Google) will not index any pages that have a question mark or other character (like an ampersand or equals sign) in the URL... what good is a site if no one can find it?</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/article/search-engine-friendly-urls\">Search Engine-Friendly URLs</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One of the worst elements of the web from a user interface standpoint is the URL. However, if they're short, logical, and self-correcting, URLs can be acceptably usable</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.merges.net/theory/20010305.html\">How to make URLs user-friendly</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.websitegoodies.com/article/32\">Creating Search Engine Friendly URLs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.merges.net/theory/20010305.html\">How to make URLs user-friendly</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>6.3 Does the site's URL work without \"www\"?</h4>\n<p>While this is not critical, and in some cases is not even possible, it is always good to give people the choice of both options.

However, if they are not present, they can cause 404 errors in your logs (site statistics). Browsers like IE will request them from the server when a site is bookmarked. If a favicon isn't available, a 404 error may be generated. Therefore, having a favicon could cut down on favicon specific 404 errors. The same is true of a 'robots.txt' file.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/webdev-tools/","relativePath":"docs/articles/webdev-tools.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"webdev-tools.md","name":"webdev-tools","frontmatter":{"title":"Web Developer Tools","weight":0,"excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<ol>\n<li>What Are Web Development Tools?</li>\n</ol>\n<h5><strong>Client-side</strong>Otherwise known as front-end web development, this refers to anything a user can see or engage with—an app or website are good examples. This is about providing a top-notch user experience and smooth interface (usually with a combination of HTML, CSS and various JavaScript libraries.<strong>Server-side</strong>Otherwise known as back-end web development, this refers to the stuff behind the scenes of apps and websites that users can't see. It's the frameworks, servers and databases that keep things running.Image Source: Paperform\n\n</h5>\n<p>When people speak about web development tools (or devtools in the biz), they're usually referring to the apps and software that allows web developers to test and debug the code and interface of a website or web application.</p>\n<p>Technically, the term doesn't refer to tools that *actually help you <em>build a webpage or app</em>. *But that distinction isn't helpful. Web developers require a range of tools that go beyond debugging and testing—whether it be a remote collaboration tool like Slack, a design tool like Figma, or even just an online forum like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">StackOverflow</a>.</p>\n<p>For that reason, we've gone beyond the traditional definition of devtools with the aim of giving a  realistic view of the kind of apps and software devs use in their day to day workflows. We think you'll find some familiar favourites, as well as some useful tools to add to your tech stack.</p>\n<h2>What To Consider When Choosing Web Development Tools</h2>\n<p>Whether you're <a href=\"https://www.templatemonster.com/bootstrap-website-templates/\">bootstrapping a website</a> from scratch or developing a simple web application, there are few things to keep in mind. Foremost is something that applies to any tool: pick the <em>right option for your specific needs.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>What works for one project might not work for the next. As a web developer, you constantly need to investigate new tools and ways of doing things. Of course, we all have our favourites, but as a general rule, your tech stack should never be stagnant.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There's one other general principle to keep in mind. Tech should simplify your workflow—not complicate it. We know how easy it is to get bogged down in the nerdy details, but when in doubt, ask yourself: <em>does this tool actually make my job easier?</em></p>\n<p>Here are a few things to think about beyond these broader considerations:</p>\n<p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Simply, what does each tool help achieve? Does it have a single purpose and can it be replaced by a more feature-rich option?</p>\n<p><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Ensure that the tools that you have control over balance comprehensive features with actually being useable.</p>\n<p><strong>Scalability:</strong> At least some of the tools that you use should be scalable to both small and large projects.</p>\n<p><strong>Portability:</strong> This may not be a gamechanger in the age of remote work, but often web devs travel between clients, the office, home and the local cafe.</p>\n<p><strong>Customisation:</strong> Whether it's a theme on Google Chrome or an add-on for your development environment, we all like to make tools feel unique to us.</p>\n<p><strong>Security:</strong> The security of users, your employer and the sites or apps you are working on always has to be looked after.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> If you work for a fancy startup with cash to splash this may not be an issue, but most folks will have to shell out for their own web development tools. Make sure you are getting bang for your buck.</p>\n<h3>A Note On Web Dev Tech Stacks</h3>\n<p>Web development is an all-encompassing term that refers to a bunch of roles. You can split web development into two parts: client-side and server-side.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, web developers specialise in one of the two. However, there are a few show-offs that can do both—they're referred to as full-stack developers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The term stack is used because the tools that websites and apps use  'stack' on top of each other to build the final product.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Check out this example of Paperform's tech stack for example.</p>\n<h2>The 50 Best Web Development Tools In 2021</h2>\n<p>Alright, as we Antipodeans say, no more beating around the bush. Let's get into the list of the best web development tools we recommend using in 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>📚 Read our guide on **[</strong>how to get web design clients fast<strong>](<a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/how-to-get-web-design-clients/\">https://paperform.co/blog/how-to-get-web-design-clients/</a>)</strong>.**</p>\n<h2>Code and Text Editors</h2>\n<p>Web developers wouldn't be able to do their jobs fast and efficiently without text editors. A dev's text editor of choice is kind of a holy thing—once devs find a text editor they love, they tend to stick with it for the long haul.</p>\n<p>Which is why it's such an important decision. It's like a carpenter choosing his hammer, or a Jedi Knight choosing his lightsaber. The good news is you can't go wrong with any listed below:</p>\n<h3>1. Atom</h3>\n<p>The creators of <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> describe it as a \"hackable text editor for the 21st Century\". This is in reference to the insane levels of customisation it offers that allow you to make it uniquely yours.</p>\n<p>Choose from thousands of open-source packages that add new functionality, tweak the look and feel with CSS, or even add your own major features with HTML and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Using Atom really is a smooth experience. It works with Mac, Windows or Linux and has all the features you would expect. Plus, there is a nice suite of real-time collaboration tools to help you work with a team.</p>\n<h3>2. Sublime Text</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> is going to be at the top of any list of the best text editors. It doesn't have all the advanced features other solutions do, but what it lacks in power, it more than makes up for with its beautiful appearance and overall ease of use.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With handy keyboard shortcuts, a Command Palette that you won't be able to live without once you use it and a UX to die for, it's an absolute pleasure to use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The context-aware auto-completion feature is particularly useful. It suggests code based on your text, meaning you can cut down on repetitive typing. Add to that an updated Python API, syntax definitions and hyper-fast load times, Sublime Text is hard to go past.</p>\n<h3>3. Notepad++</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">Notepad++</a> is for those of you who don't care about themes and minimalist design and all that fancy stuff. From an aesthetic viewpoint, it's not going to win any awards, but it's still a powerful open-source text editor that has most of your needs covered.</p>\n<p>Created by a talented software engineer web dev named Don Ho, Notepad++ is a user friendly text editing solution for Windows users. It supports 27 programming languages, synchronised edits and views, and uses Win32 API to produce a tiny program size and faster execution speed.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> This is also a good option for energy conscious users. By optimising as much as possible, Ho aims to use less CPU power and reduce power consumption, leading to a greener environment.</p>\n<h3>4. Vim</h3>\n<p>If you're after a highly configurable text editor to build your perfect programming environment, then <a href=\"https://www.vim.org/\">Vim</a> is the way to go. While it does work out of the box, for the most part, it's a tool that you have to learn to conquer.</p>\n<p>The cool thing about Vim is that it can be used for any type of text editing—from writing an email to posting blogs in Markup, or of course, editing HTML code. It comes with 200+ syntax files, a comprehensive tag system and integrations with Perl, TCL and Python, and can even act as an OLE automation server in Windows.</p>\n<h3>5. Visual Code Studio</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a> (or VS Code) is an open-source code editing program built by Microsoft. It runs everywhere and allows you to do anything from debugging code to inputting Git commands or creating Sass code.</p>\n<p>There is a bevy of appearance options, including the ability to customise fonts, icons, layout and colour scheme. But the remote development features are what set it apart—you can use a container or a remote machine as a full-featured dev environment.</p>\n<p>VS Code is the text editor of choice for Dean McPherson, Paperform's co-founder and resident code-geek. He uses the remote plugins for version control and to keep our global dev team working in the same virtual environment.</p>\n<h2>Web Application Frameworks</h2>\n<p>Web application frameworks (or just web frameworks) are software libraries that are designed to help you build web services, resources and APIs.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right framework for your project is super important. Why? Because it's difficult, time-consuming and expensive to switch to a different solution. It's much easier to stick with one.</p>\n<p>Below we've curated a list of the <a href=\"https://www.appypie.com/top-web-development-frameworks\">best web frameworks</a> in 2021—both front-end and back-end to cover all the bases. This is a big decision and this is only meant as an overview of options, so be sure to do further research before deciding on one.</p>\n<h3>6. Django</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a> is a high-level <a href=\"https://www.educba.com/python-frameworks/\">Python framework</a> built by expert developers and used by giant web apps like Reddit, Instagram and Uber. It's secure and scalable, which means it's suitable for a small side hustle or enterprise-scale projects.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, Django makes it easier to build great web apps. Fast. The focus here is on enabling devs to create sites and apps with less code (to get nerdy, Django's server-side processing speed is super fast and the file structure is feather-light).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Django's goal is to support devs to go from concept to completion as quickly as possible. They achieve this by encouraging clean design and swift development.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the greatest strengths of Django is its community. They contribute a tonne of useful packages and utilities—a search on PyPI brings up 4,000+ packages free and ready to use.</p>\n<h3>7. Ruby On Rails</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> is a favourite in the dev community. While it requires a certain quality of code, as a general rule it's easy to read, write, monkey patch, test, maintain and deploy, making it any web developer's dream.</p>\n<p>Rails, as it's called in the biz, is used in a bunch of server-side web apps, including big names like Square, Hulu, Twitch and Shopify. It's a popular framework because straight out of the box you get structures for web services, pages and a database, requiring far less groundwork than other options.</p>\n<p>So why choose Rails? Well, it's an excellent choice if you're after a robust tool that's simple to use. It has a clean design language, an intuitive workflow, and seamlessly integrates with third-party applications.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> If you are starting to build your product, Ruby on Rails is an ideal solution to get your MVP up and running. It allows solo web developers to swiftly get projects off the ground and make changes on the fly.</p>\n<h3>8. Angular</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> (or Angularjs) is a popular Javascript framework created and maintained by Google. It's a cross-platform solution with a cohesive ecosystem of third-party components, meaning you can add a bunch of your own unique functionality improvements.</p>\n<p>You'll find all the relevant features you'd expect for each stage of the development process, from code generation and splitting to complex animation timelines.</p>\n<p>The Command-line Interface (CLI) is probably the most notable feature though. it allows you to initialise, develop, scaffold and maintain Angular apps right from the command shell.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> A JavaScript library is a collection or “library” of prewritten code snippets that can be used to repeat common JavaScript functions. It's also important to note, that which JavaScript framework you use often depends on your client's/business' stack.</p>\n<h3>9. React</h3>\n<p>React (<a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React.js</a>) is another great Javascript library built by another ultra-powerful tech company: in this case, Facebook. Made specifically for building user interfaces, it makes it painless to create interactive UIs in a visual way.</p>\n<p>A component-based system means that individual components manage their own state, and can then be composed to build complex UIs. React can also render on a server using Node, and with <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\">React Native</a> you can power mobile apps as well.</p>\n<p>React is one of the most popular of the many JavaScript frameworks available. Used by WordPress for their backend and Block Editor, it's a platform to consider for any web developer working with user interfaces.</p>\n<h3>10. Vue</h3>\n<p>Yet another JavaScript library, like React, <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a> (or Vue.js) is built for working with user interfaces. Labelling itself as a more “approachable, versatile and performant” alternative, it helps you create a more maintainable and testable codebase.</p>\n<p>As with other leading frameworks, Vue allows you to take a webpage and split it up into reusable components. Each component then has its own HTML, CSS and JS needed to render that piece of the page—making it faster to make granular changes.</p>\n<p>Vue offers a more “batteries-included” approach to web application development. It's simple to use and comes with <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/\">comprehensive documentation</a> and templates to guide you along.</p>\n<h3>11. Meteor</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meteor.com/\">Meteor.js</a> is a free and open-source full-stack isomorphic framework (meaning you can run it both on the client and server side). It might not be as popular as React or Vue, but it's still considered one of the best solutions to enable devs to swiftly build and deploy web, mobile or desktop apps.</p>\n<p>One of Meteor's biggest selling points is that it seamlessly integrates with the rest of your tech stack—allowing you to focus on building rather than configuring tools to work together. Meteor APM also provides real-time metrics so you can monitor how your app is running.</p>\n<p>Boasting almost 14,000 packages, over half a million unique installs and used by companies like Ikea, Qualcomm and Honeywell, Meteor is a strong option.</p>\n<h3>12. ASP.NET</h3>\n<p>Alright, by now this is a familiar story. Prepare for the buzzwords and giant tech companies. <a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet\">ASP.NET</a> is a free, cross-platform framework for <a href=\"https://www.techcronus.com/asp-net-application-development/\">building web apps</a> and services developed by Microsoft.</p>\n<p>What sets it apart from other frameworks is that it uses C# instead of JavaScript. C# supports reference-type (class) and value-type (struct) user-defined types, which can unlock significant performance benefits over JavaScript if you're a more advanced web developer.</p>\n<p>If you're looking to learn NET then there are plenty of resources. Microsoft has plenty of <a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet\">learning materials</a> and there's an active <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet?WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website\">community on GitHub</a> with over 100,000 people and 3,700 companies contributing.</p>\n<h2>Front-End Frameworks</h2>\n<p>Front-end frameworks (or “CSS frameworks”) are packages containing pre-written, standardised code for easy application. It's kind of like a coding dictionary to help you quickly complete actions without having to come up with code yourself.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that there is some crossover with tools we've previously covered. For example, according to the <a href=\"https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/\">State of JavaScript 2020</a>*, in the US, React, Angular and Vue *are the three most popular front-end frameworks.</p>\n<p>Here are some other viable options:</p>\n<h3>13. Bootstrap</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> is a leading open-source CSS framework created by a bunch of the developers behind Twitter (ever heard of it?). Released back in 2011, it's a full-scale tool designed to help you quickly create and customise responsive mobile-first sites.</p>\n<p>It features Sass variables and mixins (so you can assign variables to a name and refer to it rather than the value itself), extensive prebuilt components and comprehensive JavaScript plugins. In a first for front-end frameworks, it also comes with its own SVG icon library designed to work with your Bootstrap sites.</p>\n<h3>14. Semantic UI</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://semantic-ui.com/\">Semantic UI</a> is a component framework for theming websites using what they call “human-friendly HTML” (sorry dogs). What they mean by this is that the tool uses words and classes as exchangeable concepts, giving you the same benefits as BEM without the headache.</p>\n<p>But the real strength here is the breadth of Semantic UI's components. Whether it's elements, collections, views, modules of behaviours, the whole gamut of interface design is covered.</p>\n<h3>15. Foundation</h3>\n<p>The folks at <a href=\"https://foundation.zurb.com/\">Foundation</a> refer to their tool as \"the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world\", which is certainly setting the bar high. Though it really is suitable for any device, medium and level of accessibility.</p>\n<p>Foundation is packed with features to help build content-focused websites, even providing users with HTML, CSS &#x26; Javascript templates to speed up the process. You can also use Foundation For Emails to craft HTML emails that look a million bucks on any platform.</p>\n<h3><strong>16. Materialize</strong></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://materializecss.com/\">Materialize</a> is a modern framework based on Google's Material Design language, combining the classic <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/principles-of-design/\">principles of design</a> with innovation and tech. As a language its goal is to help unify user experience across any platform, which is fitting, as this is a focus at Materialize as well.</p>\n<p>From the animations to UI elements and everything between, there's a real focus on <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/ux-design-portfolio/\">user experience</a> above all else. That's not to say the technical tools aren't there. They are. It's fast, robust and has a low learning curve.</p>\n<h3>17. ChromeDevTools</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/\">Chrome DevTools</a> is the name for the web development tools built into the Google Chrome web browser. No need to download any programs or check if it's got MacOS compatibility—just right click in the browser, choose “Inspect” and get stuck in.</p>\n<p>It doesn't have as many features as the other options on this list, but it does let you edit pages and diagnose problems with your sites. View and manipulate the DOM, change a page's style sheets (CSS) or use it as a JavaScript debugger.</p>\n<h3>18. Svelte</h3>\n<p>We love <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> for two reasons. One, it just sounds awesome and two, it's all about empowering folks to build their projects with *way less code, *which is something we're passionate about here at Paperform.</p>\n<p>Technically, Svelte isn't a framework or a library. It's a “compiler”, and it's gained quite a reputation in the web dev community for being one of the best frontend frameworks on the market. It's lightweight, SEO-optimised and unlike tools like React or Vue, doesn't require heavy browser processing.</p>\n<p>Svelte's “killer app” is that is has no virtual Dom. This means there's considerably less re-renders of the UI, leading to a lightning fast experience. Some devs will be put off by this, but it makes it an ideal option for beginners or smaller projects.</p>\n<h3>19. Ember</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://emberjs.com/\">Ember.js</a> is an open-source JavaScript web framework released back in 2011. Since then it's been adopted by a large chunk of the web dev community and it's easy to see why—using it's simple and, whether you're creating feature-rich apps or client-side websites, the user experience is seamless.</p>\n<p>Working with Ember is a “batteries included” experience. Out of the box you have all the tools to start building UIs that work on any device. The built-in development environment comes with fast rebuilds, auto-reload and a test runner. Ember Data also lets you set up asynchronous relationships and keep models up to date across your app, which is perfect for remote work.</p>\n<p>Not sold? Some of the biggest and best development teams in the world use Ember to iterate on their products, including Netflix, Intercom and Apple. Convinced?</p>\n<h2>Package Managers</h2>\n<p>If you've ever installed a bunch of programs on your computer you'll know it's a tedious process. You've got to visit each individual website, download the installer, then set each one up individually.</p>\n<p>This is fine if all you're doing is downloading Spotify. But back- and front-end developers work with hundreds of programs. Which is why package managers exist. These tools automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing programs from a computer's operating system.</p>\n<h3>20. Yarn</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/\">Yarn</a> is a relatively new package manager built by Facebook. It's known for its speed and stability—about the only two things you need from a package manager. But what sets it apart from similar tools is that it doubles as a project management tool.</p>\n<p>Installation is a breeze, and if you get stuck, the documentation is comprehensive. The Workspace feature allows you to split your project into sub-components, which is handy for keeping multiple versions of your project live. There is also a (small) plugin library to extend functionality.</p>\n<h3>21. Node Package Manager (npm)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">Node Package Manager</a> is a package manager for NodeJS, created in 2009 as an open-source project to give JavaScript devs an easy way to share code modules. The npm Registry consists of more than a million packages—making it the largest software registry in the world.</p>\n<p>With a quick search you'll find everything from front-end web apps to robots and routers. There is hardly a working web developer out there that wouldn't have used npm at some point. And, now that it's moved to GitHub, npm's already vibrant community is only going to grow.</p>\n<h3>22. DPKG - Package Manager for Debian</h3>\n<p>Debian is a stable and secure Linux-based operating system extremely popular with web devs. <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dpkg.1.html\">Dpkg</a> is a tool built specifically to manage Debian packages. While dpkg does have a more user-friendly front-end alternative called <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/Aptitude\">aptitude</a>, dpkg itself runs entirely via the command line.</p>\n<p>In terms of functionality, it's definitely a more low-level solution. But if you're trying to handle the installation and removal of Debian software, it's the place to start. For a more advanced tool try <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman\">Pacman</a> or <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/Apt\">APT</a> (literally, Advanced Package Tool). Both fetch packages from remote locations and deal with more complex functions.</p>\n<h2>Git Clients</h2>\n<p>In Britain, 'Git' is slang for someone you think is a bit stupid. But in the world of web development, Git is the name for the software used to track changes in file sets. Most of the time it's used to help devs collaborate during software development.</p>\n<p>A Git *client *is the software you use to work with Git repositories, which can be either remote or locally stored. These allow you to make changes to your Git project (e.g. pushing changes and staging). There are a bunch of different Git clients available across various operating systems.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> Git is a command line interface and Git clients aren't strictly necessary. It's kind of like using a translator versus learning a language natively. GUIs don't have all the same functionality that a command line client offers, which is why many web devs go that route instead.</p>\n<h3><strong>23. Github Desktop</strong></h3>\n<p>Built by GitHub, the authority when it comes to all things Git, <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">Github Desktop</a> is a tool that allows you to interact with GitHub from your desktop. It's all about giving you a beautiful interface to cut down on distraction and let you focus on what matters.</p>\n<p>Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a Git newbie, GitHub Desktop has you covered. Quickly add commits with collaborators, see all open pull requests from your repositories, and easily see before and after shots of your work in progress with expanded image diff support.</p>\n<p>On top of that there's a heap of automated testing tools to play with. Open-source and available on MacOS and Windows, GitHub is pretty much the default option.</p>\n<h3>24. GitKraken</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gitkraken.com/\">GitKraken</a> bills itself as the “easiest, safest and most powerful” way to use Git. They understand that Git can be difficult to learn, which is why they offer exhaustive docs, as well as integrations with GitHub, GitLab and Azure DevOps to make adding remotes easy.</p>\n<p>The UI is equal parts gorgeous and intuitive. One particularly helpful feature is the ability to map complicated commands to a single button or click of the keyboard. If you're working with a team, the visual commit graph also assists you to quickly view who made code changes and when.</p>\n<p>Other notable features include syntax highlighting, a nifty built-in code editor, interactive rebase and light and dark mode for those late-night coding sessions.</p>\n<h3>25. SourceTree</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/\">Sourcetree</a> is a Graphical User Interface (GUI for the cool kids) used to manage Git repository hosts. Built by Atlassian (go Aussies!) it allows you to visualise and manage your repos so you can focus purely on coding.</p>\n<p>Whether you're just starting out as a web developer or  are an old pro, Sourcetree has all the tools you need. Leave the command line behind, or delve deeper to review change-sets, stash or cherry-pick between branches—built-in smart branching keeps development clean and efficient.</p>\n<p>Sourcetree is available to download for free on both MacOS and Windows. They've got a huge range of <a href=\"https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/tutorial-learn-bitbucket-with-sourcetree/\">tutorials</a> that'll have you up and running in no time. After some initial hiccups, it's now more powerful and reliable than almost any other Git client.</p>\n<h2>API and Testing Cloud Tools</h2>\n<p>Web APIs are a crucial part of web development these days. APIs allow devs to access specific features or data within an application, service or other system.</p>\n<p>For example, the tech world recently went nuts when Notion announced the beta for their API. By accessing the API devs can now connect other apps with Notion pages and databases.</p>\n<p><strong>📚 Learn more about **[</strong>Paperform's Notion integration<strong>](<a href=\"https://paperform.co/integrations/notion/\">https://paperform.co/integrations/notion/</a>)</strong>.**</p>\n<p>When testing and building with web APIs it's crucial to have reliable tools. Here are some of the best:</p>\n<h3>26. Postman</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.postman.com/\">Postman</a> is an API platform for building using APIs (duh) with features centred around simplifying the process and streamlining team collaboration. <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/api-platform/\">They promise</a> 5x faster development, 4x faster bug fixes and a whopping 10x more effective team collaboration.</p>\n<p>Do they back it up? The *15 million *developers that use Postman would say so. There are integrated tools for every stage of the API lifecycle, from design, mocking, testing and deploying all the way through to maintenance and deprecation.</p>\n<h3>27. REST Assured</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://rest-assured.io/\">REST Assured</a> is the tool of choice for most web devs working with Java. Made so you don't have to be a HTTP expert to use it, REST Assured enables you to test and validate REST services with the simplicity of more dynamic languages like Ruby.</p>\n<p>It saves you time and effort through automating part of the boilerplate code required to set up HTTP connections, send and receive requests and parse responses. There are also Given/When/Then test notations to help make tests easily comprehensible.</p>\n<h3>28. HoppScotch</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://hoppscotch.io/\">HoppScotch</a> is a lightweight open source API development tool that runs smoothly and looks beautiful. Over the last few months it's gained popularity with the dev community, largely thanks to its balance of advanced functionality and gorgeous design.</p>\n<p>Whether you need to establish full-duplex communication channels or execute queries with GraphQL, Hoppscotch can handle just about anything you throw at it. You can even add your own translations if English isn't your preferred language.</p>\n<p>Other features include collections to keep API requests organised, the ability to sync and restore request entries with a click, and real-time connections with WebSocket, MQTT and more.</p>\n<h3><strong>29. LambdaTest</strong></h3>\n<p>It's crucial that web applications and services work the same way no matter what browser folks use to access them. But you can't check how your HTML, CSS and JavaScript looks on every web browser and operating system on the planet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lambdatest.com/\">LambaTest</a> can. This tool performs automated and live interactive testing on 2,000+ real browsers and operating systems to help ensure your web apps look spiffy wherever they appear.</p>\n<p>It also has the ability to auto-generate full page screenshots across any browser, OS, device or resolution. And with integrated debugging, geolocation testing and seamless collaboration via Asana, Slack and Trello integrations, Lambdatest is a must-have.</p>\n<h2>Web Design and Prototyping Tools</h2>\n<p>It's not enough just to know how to code. Part of being a web designer is understanding what goes into good UI and <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/in-conversation-kyro-samaan/\">UX design</a>—from prototyping and wire-framing to creating a visual language for your app. These <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/ux-design-tools/\">design tools</a> are vital.</p>\n<h3>30. Figma</h3>\n<p>Only a few years ago, if you wanted a professional design tool you'd need to spend a whole lot of cash and download complex software. Not anymore.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/ui-design-tool/\">Figma</a>, you get everything you need to design for the web, completely free and accessible from any browser. From UI, UX and <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/graphic-design-tools/\">graphic design</a> to wire-framing and diagramming, Figma truly is the all-in-one platform for your design needs.</p>\n<p>It's like LEGO for web devs. Need to mock up a mobile app? Design an entire UI? Build your client's dream website from scratch? Just use the drag-and-drop editor and away you go. With version history you can even collaborate in real-time and not worry about breaking things.</p>\n<p>There's a reason the whole internet is raving about it—Figma's a rare tool that you will find yourself actively looking for reasons to use. It's not hyperbole when we say that it's seriously the only design tool you'll need.</p>\n<h3>31. Adobe XD</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html\">Adobe XD</a> is just the latest in a long range of excellent design tools from Adobe. With XD you can sketch wireframes and mockups, build interactive prototypes and create high-fidelity designs for any screen, thanks to their vector-based system.</p>\n<p>Flat images not enough? 3D transform allows you to turn static objects into dynamic, three dimensional designs in a click. Move or rotate objects, add the appearance of depth, or even build unique immersive AR/VR experiences.</p>\n<p>Above all, Adobe XD succeeds at making your prototypes feel like the real thing—with no coding required. Add user flows, interactions and motion, and save time by using reusable buttons and components.</p>\n<p>Of course, Adobe XD works seamlessly with the rest of the Adobe suite (editing .PSD files from Photoshop is a particularly handy feature). There are a range of co-editing tools to aid real-time collaboration and 200+ plugins to extend functionality.</p>\n<h3>32. Sketch</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sketch.com/\">Sketch</a> vs Figma is kind of like Apple vs Android: both offer very similar tools, and which one you prefer comes down to preference and your individual workflow.</p>\n<p>Sketch happens to be the app of choice for companies like Google, Facebook and Xbox. It's easy to use, offers a host of useful keyboard shortcuts, and is lightning fast no matter what you throw at it, from <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/social-media-design/\">social media designs</a> to working prototypes or fancy new icon sets.</p>\n<p>Having said that, most web developers agree that Figma's prototyping capabilities are superior to Sketch. They also cite the built-in version history, collaboration features and the way Figma handles colour and text styling. The Auto-Layout is also preferred over Sketch's Smart layout.</p>\n<p>But. That's not the whole story. Sketch is regarded as being more stable (Figma can be on the buggy side sometimes), having clearer layer organisation, and being faster to load large files. There's also a dark mode, which we all know, is music to any web developer's ear.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> The Figma vs Sketch battle isn't going to be decided in this blog post. Luckily, Figma is free to use and Sketch has a generous free trial. If you're unsure which is the right choice for you, just try them both.</p>\n<h3>33. ProtoPie</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.protopie.io/\">ProtoPie</a> bill themselves as the \"easiest way to turn your interaction design ideas into realistic prototypes\". It's a no-code creation tool used to create interactive prototypes for mobile, web, desktop or the 'Internet of Things' (IoT).</p>\n<p>What sets ProtoPie apart is one thing: simplicity. Their goal isn't to be the most complex tool on the market—they want to take the pain out of building workable prototypes, fast. As with any no-code tool, the emphasis is on replacing code with simple buttons and keyboard commands to simplify your workflow.</p>\n<p>There's a gradual learning curve which makes it great for beginners. Prototypes also interact with each other, meaning you can make interactions across devices. It's not as popular as the big players, but it's certainly a powerful tool.</p>\n<h3>34. Framer</h3>\n<p>If you're comfortable with code, then <a href=\"https://framer.com/\">Framer</a> is an awesome tool to empower you to create interactive, highly-customisable prototypes. Web devs around the world use it to build apps, websites, design systems and even slick new video game interfaces.</p>\n<p>What sets it apart from something like Figma? Well, with Framer the idea is that you can work with designs that can *realistically be implemented *with code. It's a bridge for UX designers and developers to collaborate and rapidly experiment in a shared workspace.</p>\n<p>📚 **Related reading: **<a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/in-conversation-kyro-samaan/\"><strong>How to stand out as a UX Designer</strong></a></p>\n<p>Even if code isn't your thing, Framer is great. The GUI and design elements are on part with Sketch (or at least in the same ballpark) and the built-in prototyping is a breeze to use. There are also plenty of third-party packages to add new elements.</p>\n<h3>35. Toolset</h3>\n<p>Sick of doing everything with code? <a href=\"https://toolset.com/\">Toolset</a> is a WordPress page builder which lets you build custom sites without any code. This is a great option for web developers and designers looking to complete complex projects quickly.</p>\n<p>Use Toolset to design from within WordPress. Create rich sites that look great on any device and load quickly for the SEO gods. It's got everything you could require to set up custom post types, fields, templates, searches, front-end forms and more.</p>\n<p>The biggest benefit of Toolset is that it saves you from having to use a bunch of different tools to build WordPress sites—all for a reasonable price of $69.</p>\n<h3>36. Animator By Haiku</h3>\n<p>Animation is difficult but <a href=\"https://www.haikuforteams.com/animator/\">Animator by Haiku</a> makes it a little bit more palatable. It lets you bring motion design to production, from your initial design tools like Figma to your final codebase.</p>\n<p>Animator uses an interface called Timeline to choreograph animations in a visual way. You can sequence and animate elements using the built-in curves library, or delve deeper with the custom editor. If you're more comfortable with code, use any code editor of your choice to animate directly from your code.</p>\n<h3>37. Affinity Designer</h3>\n<p>Adobe Illustrator has long been the industry standard when it comes to creating vector graphics. However, the new kid on the block, <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/\">Affinity Designer</a>, is certainly giving Adobe a run for its money.</p>\n<p>You'll find Affinity evangelists all over the net—and for good reason. It offers a silky-smooth experience at a much more affordable price, custom-built with professional illustrators, web designers, game devs and other creatives in mind.</p>\n<p>Affinity offers many of the same tools as Adobe Illustrator in a beautifully designed (and not bloated) package. Work with vectors and rasters to create concept art, print projects, logos, icons, UIs or just about anything else you can imagine.</p>\n<p>The biggest drawcard? There's no monthly fee. You can own Affinity Designer for a one-off payment of $84.99 on Windows or Mac or $34.99 on iPad.</p>\n<h2>Collaboration Tools</h2>\n<p>We've covered just about all the technical tools you could possibly need to be a web developer. But whether you're working in-house, at an agency or going it alone as a freelancer, <a href=\"https://unito.io/features/\">collaboration tools</a> are equally as important as your text editor of choice.</p>\n<p>Often the success of a project isn't simply down to technical brilliance—it relies on clear and efficient communication. The tools below will help you achieve it.</p>\n<h3>38. ClickUp</h3>\n<p>Product management tools should do two things: simplify your processes and help you ship products faster. <a href=\"https://clickup.com/\">ClickUp</a> does both. With an expansive suite of tools, it is truly “one app to replace them all”, covering tasks, docs, chat, goals and more.</p>\n<p>Whether you're working solo or in a team, ClickUp lets you map out tasks, better plan your work and see your overall product vision. The major benefit here is the dizzying versatility of the platform. From building mind maps to planning tasks on a Kanban board, you can build out your own custom product management setup.</p>\n<h3>39. Asana</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://asana.com/\">Asana</a> is probably the single most well-known and popular project management and collaboration tool on the market. It's a tool built to stop you shuffling between emails, spreadsheets and other apps to keep organised—from brainstorming to meeting that deadline, you can manage everything with Asana.</p>\n<p>At Paperform we use Asana to assign tasks to team members, create projects split among our Product, Marketing and Content teams, and monitor deadlines to ensure we're hitting our goals. It's simple and visual, and is particularly excellent for keeping remote teams on the same page.</p>\n<h3>40. JIRA</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\">JIRA</a> is the go-to project management platform for software teams to plan, track and release their products. From creating user stories and planning sprints to the final stages of shipping and data analysis, JIRA is *the *way to take any product to launch and beyond.</p>\n<p>One big advantage JIRA has over other similar tools is that it's so customisable. It is possible to build the perfect workflow for your specific product or team—this is also a slight drawback, as it results in a slightly steeper learning curve upfront.</p>\n<p>As you'd expect, it's built with trademark Atlassian polish. And with the Atlassian Marketplace you can connect with over 3,000 first and third-party apps like Slack, Google Drive and GitHub, to extend functionality.</p>\n<h3>41. Slack</h3>\n<p>If you work online in any capacity and haven't heard of <a href=\"https://slack.com/intl/en-au/\">Slack</a>, you must be living under a rock, at the bottom of the ocean, next to a starfish named Patrick. In the last few years, Slack has become synonymous with remote team communication.</p>\n<p>At its core Slack is a team messaging platform. It cuts down on the need for email by separating conversations into distinct Channels, so you can track topics, ideas and projects without long email threads. This makes it the virtual headquarters for your business.</p>\n<p>Of course, there's much more to it than simple text chat. Jump on video calls, add integrations with your favourite tools, and even communicate with external clients or folks in other companies</p>\n<p>Slack isn't just for teams, either. Communities allow you to connect with people in your niche—<a href=\"https://http//www.javaspecialists.eu/slack/\">Java Specialists</a>, <a href=\"https://rubydevs.herokuapp.com/\">Ruby Developers</a> and <a href=\"https://pyslackers.com/web\">Python Developers</a> are just a few of the most active.</p>\n<h3>42. Zoom</h3>\n<p>Occasionally an app or program hits levels of popularity so high that it becomes the noun for what it's used for. This happened to Google long ago (“I'll Google it”) and it happened to video chat tool <a href=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a> in the last year and a half (RIP Skype).</p>\n<p>This happened for a reason: Zoom is awesome. While nothing replaces the feeling of face-to-face communication, it's the next best thing. Whether you want to chat to your family across the country or liaise with web design clients, it makes video calls ridiculously easy.</p>\n<p>Zoom is free for 40-minute calls, meaning your meetings come with a convenient end timer. Plus you can record any calls (with your companion's permission), which has become a popular way to record <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/how-to-record-a-webinar/\">webinars</a> and podcasts.</p>\n<p>**📚 Related reading: **<a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/how-to-be-a-good-interviewer/\"><strong>How to be a good interviewer</strong></a></p>\n<h2>Miscellaneous Web Development Tools</h2>\n<h3>43. TypeScript</h3>\n<p>TypeScript is an insanely popular open-source language that builds extra features on top of JavaScript. Essentially, think of regular Java as Clark Kent and TypeScript as Superman—bigger, better, faster and all-round more capable.</p>\n<p>Devs love Typescript because it makes their job easier. It catches both code and type errors, as well as bugs that can easily be missed. This reduces troubleshooting time, while also saving you the effort of having to track down mistakes manually.</p>\n<p>The only real downside is that once you try TypeScript you'll find it hard to return to vanilla Java. The good thing is that you don't need to make a binary choice—all valid JavaScript code is also TypeScript code, and TypeScript can be transformed into Java too.</p>\n<p>If you want clean, simple code with excellent documentation and tools that save you hours of time, TypeScript might be worth a try. Just don't think you can master it in a few minutes, as most devs find there's a steep (albeit worthwhile) learning curve.</p>\n<h3>44. Sass</h3>\n<p>You might've seen the term <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/guide\">Sass</a> mentioned in web dev circles. But what is it? Well, Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends what you can do with regular CSS, adding special features like variables, nested rules, inheritance (not the monetary type) and mixins.</p>\n<p>The benefit is that it speeds up your workflow and modularises your code, making edits easier and more efficient to make. It allows you to achieve the same end result as regular CSS, with a fraction of the effort.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say you're working with a theme colour that you keep having to reuse in your CSS code. Rather than having to retype it every time, you can specify the colour once and save the variable. Then, every time you want to use that colour you just refer to the variable instead of hard-coding it.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> Sass is compatible with any version of CSS, the only requirement being you need Ruby installed for it to work. Just make sure you don't start using Sass before you have CSS mastered—it's important to get a firm grip of the basics first.</p>\n<h3>45. Stack Overflow</h3>\n<p>Okay, so this isn't technically a tool. However, it's not hyperbole on the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> website when it says, “every developer has a tab open to Stack Overflow”. Ask around—they do. It's the most popular and comprehensive web development community on the internet.</p>\n<p>Stack Overflow is a public platform that aims to build the single most definitive collection of coding questions and answers. Developers, system admins and data scientists of every shape and size rely on it for accurate information to difficult technical challenges.</p>\n<p>We're talking the real nitty gritty. If you want to know why InvokeAsync shows an an error in a Blazor component, how to undo the most recent local commits in Git, or why HTML thinks the tag “chucknorris” is a colour, this is the place for you.</p>\n<p>While it's undoubtedly a gold mine of useful resources, it's important to note that the community can be a bit toxic when it comes to welcoming new web developers. Stack Overflow mods are aware of this (and have added new guidelines in response) but do be wary—and look for existing answers before asking a query of your own.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> More broadly it would be remiss not to mention your other best friend: Google! Not even the most seasoned web developer knows how to fix everything and you can almost guarantee that you'll find someone out there who's had the same problem as you at some point.</p>\n<h3>46. Squoosh Image Optimiser\n</h3>\n<p>Assets. Content. Media. Even the simplest web design project will need basic images and icons. Image optimisation apps allow you to compress image file sizes without affecting quality, which means your sites will stay as fast and responsive as possible.</p>\n<p>Now, there's no shortage of great image optimisation apps but we love <a href=\"https://squoosh.app/\">Squoosh</a>. It's a no-frills experience that does exactly what you need it to. Just drag and drop your image into the editor and Squoosh does its thing.</p>\n<p>You aren't limited to compression either. With the simple interface you can resize, compress or change the image format. The changes are almost instant and the finished product can be downloaded with a click.</p>\n<p>One drawback is that you can only work with one image at a time. So, if you're working on a large project requiring lots of images, <a href=\"https://shortpixel.com/\">ShortPixel</a> may better suit your needs.</p>\n<h3>47. ColorPick Eyedropper Chrome Extension</h3>\n<p>Whether you're designing a website, putting together a UI or creating a <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/canva-alternatives/\">Canva design</a>, colour is serious business for web developers and designers. Colours are crucial for brand awareness, evoking certain emotions and, most importantly, accessibility.</p>\n<p>Colour picking tools allow you to identify the Hex codes of elements on the web to gain inspiration or keep designs consistent. There are thousands of tools in this space, but you won't find one easier than <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg?hl=en\">ColorPick Eyedropper for Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>Just click the extension and hover over <em>any</em> element on *any *webpage. A small box appears with the Hex code and RGB model. These are automatically copied to the clipboard for you to use. If your only experience working with colours was using crayons in kindergarten, Material.io has a great to the <a href=\"https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-usage-and-palettes\">Material Design system</a>.</p>\n<h3>48. Google Lighthouse</h3>\n<p>Technically a part of Chrome Developer Tools, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/\">Google Lighthouse</a> deserves its own dedicated entry. It's an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it on any existing web page to audit overall performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO.</p>\n<p>While you can run it from the command line, or as a Node module, the visual interface within Chrome DevTools is useful for getting actionable insight into what's working (and what is not working) about any given site.</p>\n<p>There are two new features that extend the functionality somewhat too. Stack Packs allow Lighthouse to detect what platform your site is built on and display more specific guidance based on your unique tools.</p>\n<p><strong>💡Pro Tip:</strong> New Lighthouse plugins also allow you to use the data you've collected to create new audits and reports. Used in tandem with PageSpeed Insights, it's a surefire way to make sure your website is in good shape.</p>\n<h3>49. A Second Monitor</h3>\n<p>No guide to web development tools would be complete without recommending you treat yourself to a second monitor. The extra screen real estate makes life <em>so much easier</em> and development <em>so much faster.</em></p>\n<p>Just think of a world where you can have IDE and terminal open on one screen, and the app that you're debugging on the other. Or Slack on the first, your browser and Stack Overflow on the second, maybe Spotify in the corner for some Lo-Fi beats.</p>\n<p>With one screen you're constantly cycling through open applications. Half the time you lose a tab, or forget what you're looking for altogether. This takes time, and as we all know, time is money. Treat yourself to a second monitor—it's a whole new world.</p>\n<h3>50. Paperform</h3>\n<p>For all the advances we've made in the world—sending billionaires to the moon, having the power of a supercomputer in our pockets—it's still weirdly difficult to code beautiful online forms (seriously, PHP is a pain.) That's where <a href=\"https://paperform.co/\">Paperform</a> comes in.</p>\n<p>Paperform empowers you to create beautiful <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/best-online-form-builders/\">online forms</a> and landing pages without any code. Just use our free-text editor to build anything from basic <a href=\"https://paperform.co/templates/contact-us-form/\">contact forms</a> to complex <a href=\"https://paperform.co/templates/apparel-order-form/\">eCommerce pages</a> that can be embedded anywhere on the internet.</p>\n<p>Use our theme tools to get started, then add your own unique tweaks with support for custom HTML and CSS. Developing on WordPress? We've even got a plugin that makes <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/wordpress-form-builder-plugins/\">embedding forms on WordPress</a> a breeze—and makes life way easier for you and your clients.</p>\n<p>But that's not all you can do. Want to collect feedback from <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/customer-satisfaction-survey/\">satisfied customers</a>? Send a <a href=\"https://paperform.co/templates/new-client-onboarding-form/\">client questionnaire</a> for each new project? Or maybe you want to set up a <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/one-page-website/\">landing page</a> where you can sell <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/online-course-ideas/\">online courses</a>, schedule appointments and <a href=\"https://paperform.co/blog/email-list-sign-ups/\">grow a mailing list</a>?</p>\n<p>With Paperform you can do all that and more. And with our 3,000+ Direct and Zapier integrations, connecting with the rest of your tech stack to streamline your web development workflow is so easy your grandma could do it</p>\n<p><img

My contribution was the following analogy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine an enormous speaker, mounted on a pole, playing a repeating sound. The speaker is so large, you can see the cone move back and forth with the sound. Mark a point on the cone, and now rotate the pole. Trace the point from an above-ground view, if the resulting squiggly curve is off-center, then there is frequency corresponding the pole's rotational frequency represented in the sound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dr Bill Connelly from Australia National University has created an interactive simulation of the analogy. Here, the sound from the speaker is a chord of two tones: just enter their frequency and amplitude, and see how the DFT is calculated from the analysis of the rotation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.billconnelly.net/?p=276\"><img src=\"https://revolution-computing.typepad.com/.a/6a010534b1db25970b01bb08743789970d-800wi\" alt=\"DFT\" title=\"DFT\"></a></p>"},{"url":"/docs/audio/dfft/","relativePath":"docs/audio/dfft.md","relativeDir":"docs/audio","base":"dfft.md","name":"dfft","frontmatter":{"title":"Discrete Fast Fourier Transform","weight":0,"excerpt":"Fast Fourier Transform","seo":{"title":"fft","description":"The discrete Fourier transform operates on sampled data,\nin contrast to the standard Fourier transform which is\ndefined for continuous functions.","robots":[],"extra":[{"name":"og:description","value":"The discrete Fourier transform operates on sampled data,\nin contrast to the standard Fourier transform which is\ndefined for continuous functions.","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":false},{"name":"og:image","value":"images/fft.jpg","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":true},{"name":"og:title","value":"Fast Fourier Transform","keyName":"property","relativeUrl":false}],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>Frequency and the fast Fourier transform</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy,\nfrequency and vibration.</p>\n<p>— Nikola Tesla</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>This chapter was written in collaboration with SW's father, PW van der Walt.</em></p>\n<h2>Introducing frequency</h2>\n<p>We'll start by setting up some plotting styles and importing the usual\nsuspects:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Make plots appear inline, set custom plotting style\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('style/elegant.mplstyle')\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import numpy as np\n</code></pre>\n<p>The discrete<sup id=\"fnref-discrete\"><a href=\"#fn-discrete\" class=\"footnote-ref\">discrete</a></sup> Fourier transform (DFT) is a mathematical technique\nto convert temporal or spatial data into <em>frequency domain</em> data.\n<em>Frequency</em> is a familiar concept, due to its colloquial occurrence in\nthe English language: the lowest notes your headphones can rumble out\nare around 20 Hertz, whereas middle C on a piano lies around 261.6\nHertz. Hertz (Hz), or oscillations per second, in this case literally\nrefers to the number of times per second at which the membrane inside\nthe headphone moves to-and-fro. That, in turn, creates compressed\npulses of air which, upon arrival at your eardrum, induces a vibration\nat the same frequency.

Well, you have $N$\n(complex) sinusoids of different frequencies ($2 \\pi f \\times 0, 2 \\pi f \\times\n1, 2 \\pi f \\times 3, ..., 2 \\pi f \\times (N - 1)$), and you want to see how\nstrongly your signal corresponds to each. Starting with the first,\nyou take the dot product with the signal (which, in itself, entails $N$\nmultiplication operations).

However, the classical Cooley-Tukey\nalgorithm implemented in FFTPACK (and used by SciPy) recursively breaks up the transform\ninto smaller (prime-sized) pieces and only shows this improvement for\n\"smooth\" input lengths (an input length is considered smooth when its\nlargest prime factor is small). For large prime-sized pieces, the\nBluestein or Rader algorithms can be used in conjunction with the\nCooley-Tukey algorithm, but this optimization is not implemented in\nFFTPACK.<sup id=\"fnref-fast\"><a href=\"#fn-fast\" class=\"footnote-ref\">fast</a></sup></p>\n<p>Let us illustrate:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import time\n\nfrom scipy import fftpack\nfrom sympy import factorint\n\nK = 1000\nlengths = range(250, 260)\n\n# Calculate the smoothness for all input lengths\nsmoothness = [max(factorint(i).keys()) for i in lengths]\n\n\nexec_times = []\nfor i in lengths:\n    z = np.random.random(i)\n\n    # For each input length i, execute the FFT K times\n    # and store the execution time\n\n    times = []\n    for k in range(K):\n        tic = time.monotonic()\n        fftpack.fft(z)\n        toc = time.monotonic()\n        times.append(toc - tic)\n\n    # For each input length, remember the *minimum* execution time\n    exec_times.append(min(times))\n\n\nf, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)\nax0.stem(lengths, np.array(exec_times) * 10**6)\nax0.set_ylabel('Execution time (µs)')\n\nax1.stem(lengths, smoothness)\nax1.set_ylabel('Smoothness of input length\\n(lower is better)')\nax1.set_xlabel('Length of input');\n</code></pre>\n<!-- caption text=\"FFT execution time vs smoothness for different input lengths\" -->\n<p>The intuition is that, for smooth input lengths, the FFT can be broken up\ninto many small pieces.

E.g., when we do the real\nFourier transform of a signal of all ones, an input that has no\nvariation and therefore only has the slowest, constant Fourier\ncomponent (also known as the \"DC\" or Direct Current component—just\nelectronics jargon for \"mean of the signal\"), we see this DC component\nappearing as the first entry:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from scipy import fftpack\nN = 10\n\nfftpack.fft(np.ones(N))  # The first component is np.mean(x) * N\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we try the FFT on a rapidly changing signal, we see a high\nfrequency component appear:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">z = np.ones(10)\nz[::2] = -1\n\nprint(f'Applying FFT to {z}')\nfftpack.fft(z)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the FFT returns a complex spectrum which, in the case of\nreal inputs, is conjugate symmetrical (i.e., symmetric in the real\npart, and anti-symmetric in the imaginary part):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">x = np.array([1, 5, 12, 7, 3, 0, 4, 3, 2, 8])\nX = fftpack.fft(x)\n\nwith np.printoptions(precision=2):\n    print(\"Real part:     \", X.real)\n    print(\"Imaginary part:\", X.imag)\n</code></pre>\n<p>(And, again, recall that the first component is <code>np.mean(x) * N</code>.)</p>\n<p>The <code>fftfreq</code> function tells us which frequencies we are looking at\nspecifically:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">fftpack.fftfreq(10)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The result tells us that our maximum component occured at a frequency\nof 0.5 cycles per sample. This agrees with the input, where a\nminus-one-plus-one cycle repeated every second sample.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it is convenient to view the spectrum organized slightly\ndifferently, from high-negative to low to-high-positive (for now, we\nwon't dive too deeply into the concept of negative frequency, other\nthan saying a real-world sine wave is produced by a combination of\npositive and negative frequencies). We re-shuffle the spectrum using\nthe <code>fftshift</code> function.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Discrete Fourier transforms {.callout}</strong></p>\n<p>The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) converts a sequence of $N$\nequally spaced real or complex samples $x<em>{0},x</em>{1},\\ldots, x<em>{N-1}$ of\na function $x(t)$ of time (or another variable, depending on the\napplication) into a sequence of $N$ complex numbers $X</em>{k}$ by the\nsummation</p>\n<p>$$\nX<em>{k}=\\sum</em>{n=0}^{N-1}x_{n}e^{-j2\\pi kn/N},;k=0,1,\\ldots,\nN-1.\n$$</p>\n<p>With the numbers $X<em>{k}$ known, the inverse DFT _exactly</em> recovers the\nsample values $x_{n}$ through the summation</p>\n<p>$$x<em>{n}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum</em>{k=0}^{N-1}X_{k}e^{j2\\pi kn/N}.$$</p>\n<p>Keeping in mind that $e^{j\\theta}=\\cos\\theta+j\\sin\\theta,$ the last\nequation shows that the DFT has decomposed the sequence $x<em>{n}$ into a\ncomplex discrete Fourier series with coefficients $X</em>{k}$. Comparing\nthe DFT with a continuous complex Fourier series</p>\n<p>$$x(t)=\\sum<em>{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}c</em>{n}e^{jn\\omega_{0}t},$$</p>\n<p>the DFT is a <em>finite</em> series with $N$ terms defined at the equally\nspaced discrete instances of the <em>angle</em> $(\\omega<em>{0}t</em>{n})=2\\pi\\frac{k}{N}$\nin the interval $[0,2\\pi)$,\ni.e. <em>including</em> $0$ and <em>excluding</em> $2\\pi$.\nThis automatically normalizes the DFT so that time does\nnot appear explicitly in the forward or inverse transform.</p>\n<p>If the original function $x(t)$ is limited in frequency to less than\nhalf of the sampling frequency (the so-called <em>Nyquist frequency</em>),\ninterpolation between sample values produced by the inverse DFT will\nusually give a faithful reconstruction of $x(t)$. If $x(t)$ is <em>not</em>\nlimited as such, the inverse DFT can, in general, not be used to\nreconstruct $x(t)$ by interpolation. Note that this limit does not\nimply that there are <em>no</em> methods that can do such a\nreconstruction—see, e.g., compressed sensing, or finite rate of\ninnovation sampling.</p>\n<p>The function $e^{j2\\pi k/N}=\\left(e^{j2\\pi/N}\\right)^{k}=w^{k}$ takes on\ndiscrete values between $0$ and $2\\pi\\frac{N-1}{N}$ on the unit circle in\nthe complex plane. The function $e^{j2\\pi kn/N}=w^{kn}$ encircles the\norigin $n\\frac{N-1}{N}$ times, thus generating harmonics of the fundamental\nsinusoid for which $n=1$.</p>\n<p>The way in which we defined the DFT leads to a few subtleties\nwhen $n>\\frac{N}{2}$, for even $N$ <sup id=\"fnref-odd_n\"><a href=\"#fn-odd_n\" class=\"footnote-ref\">odd_n</a></sup>. The function $e^{j2\\pi kn/N}$ is plotted\nfor increasing values of $k$ in the figure below,\nfor the cases $n=1$ to $n=N-1$ for $N=16$. When $k$ increases from $k$\nto $k+1$, the angle increases by $\\frac{2\\pi n}{N}$. When $n=1$,\nthe step is $\\frac{2\\pi}{N}$. When $n=N-1$, the angle\nincreases by $2\\pi\\frac{N-1}{N}=2\\pi-\\frac{2\\pi}{N}$. Since $2\\pi$\nis precisely once around the circle, the step equates to $-\\frac{2\\pi}{N}$,\ni.e. in the direction of a negative\nfrequency. The components up to $N/2$ represent <em>positive</em> frequency\ncomponents, those above $N/2$ up to $N-1$ represent <em>negative</em>\nfrequencies. The angle increment for the component $N/2$\nfor $N$ even advances precisely halfway around the circle for\neach increment in $k$ and can therefore be interpreted as either a\npositive or a negative frequency. This component of the DFT represents\nthe Nyquist Frequency, i.e. half of the sampling frequency, and is\nuseful to orientate oneself when looking at DFT graphics.</p>\n<p>The FFT in turn is simply a special and highly efficient algorithm for\ncalculating the DFT. Whereas a straightforward calculation of the DFT\ntakes of the order of $N^{2}$ calculations to compute, the FFT\nalgorithm requires of the order $N\\log N$ calculations.

We will use actual\ndata from an FMCW radar to demonstrate one such an application: target\ndetection.</p>\n<p>Roughly, an FMCW radar works like this (see box \"A\nsimple FMCW radar system\" for more detail):</p>\n<p>A signal with changing frequency is generated. This signal is\ntransmitted by an antenna, after which it travels outwards, away from the\nradar. When it hits an object, part of the signal is reflected back\nto the radar, where it is received, multiplied by a copy of the\ntransmitted signal, and sampled, turning it into\nnumbers that are packed into an array. Our challenge is to interpret\nthose numbers to form meaningful results.</p>\n<p>The multiplication step above is important. From school, recall the\ntrigonometric identity:</p>\n<p>$\n\\sin(xt) \\sin(yt) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\left[ \\sin \\left( (x - y)t + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) - \\sin \\left( (x + y)t + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) \\right]\n$</p>\n<p>Thus, if we multiply the received signal by the transmitted signal, we\nexpect two frequency components to appear in the spectrum: one that is\nthe difference in frequencies between the received and transmitted\nsignal, and one that is the sum of their frequencies.</p>\n<p>We are particularly interested in the first, since that gives us some\nindication of how long it took the signal to reflect back to the radar\n(in other words, how far away the object is from us!). We discard the\nother by applying a low-pass filter to the signal (i.e., a filter that\ndiscards any high frequencies).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A simple FMCW radar system</strong> {.callout}</p>\n<p><img src=\"../figures/FMCW_Block.png\" alt=\"The block diagram of a simple FMCW radar system\"></p>\n<p>A block diagram of a simple FMCW radar that uses separate\ntransmit and receive antennas is shown above. The radar consists of a waveform generator\nthat generates a sinusoidal signal of which the frequency varies\nlinearly around the required transmit frequency. The generated signal\nis amplified to the required power level by the transmit amplifier\nand routed to the transmit antenna via a coupler circuit where a copy\nof the transmit signal is tapped off. The transmit antenna radiates\nthe transmit signal as an electromagnetic wave in a narrow beam\ntowards the target to be detected. When the wave encounters an object\nthat reflects electromagnetic waves, a fraction of of the energy\nirradiating the target is reflected back to the receiver as a second\nelectromagnetic wave that propagates in the direction of the radar\nsystem. When this wave encounters the receive antenna, the antenna\ncollects the energy in the wave energy impinging on it and converts\nit to a fluctuating voltage that is fed to the mixer. The mixer\nmultiplies the received signal with a replica of the transmit signal\nand produces a sinusoidal signal with a frequency equal to the\ndifference in frequency between the transmitted and received\nsignals. The low-pass filter ensures that the received signal is band\nlimited (i.e., does not contain frequencies that we don't care about)\nand the receive amplifier strengthens the signal to a suitable\namplitude for the analog to digital converter (ADC) that feeds data\nto the computer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize, we should note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The data that reaches the computer consists of $N$ samples sampled\n(from the multiplied, filtered signal) at a sample frequency of\n$f_{s}$.</li>\n<li>The <strong>amplitude</strong> of the returned signal varies depending on the\n<strong>strength of the reflection</strong> (i.e., is a property of the target\nobject and the distance between the target and the radar).</li>\n<li>The <strong>frequency measured</strong> is an indication of the <strong>distance</strong> of the\ntarget object from the radar.</li>\n</ul>\n<!--\n\n### Signal properties in the time domain\n\nThe transmit signal is a sinusoidal signal with an instantaneous\nfrequency that increases linearly with time, as shown in\nFig. [fig:FMCW waveform](a).\n\nStarting at $f_{min}$, the frequency increases at a rate $S$ Hz/s to $f_{max}.$\nThe frequency is then decreased rapidly back to $f_{min}$\nafter which a next frequency sweep occurs.\n\nThis signal is radiated by a directional transmit antenna. When the\nwave with propagation velocity $v\\approx300\\times10^{6}$ m/s (the\npropagation speed of electromagnetic waves in air is ever-so-slightly\nslower than the speed of light in a vacuum) hits a target at a range $R$,\nthe echo will reach the radar after a time\n\n$$t_{d}=\\frac{2R}{v}.$$\n\nHere it is collected by the receive antenna and converted to a\nsinusoidally fluctuating voltage. The received signal is a replica of\nthe transmitted signal, delayed by the transit time $t_{d}$ and is\nshown dashed in Fig. [fig:FMCW waveform](b).\n\nA radar is designed to detect targets up to a maximum range $R_{max}$.\nEchoes from maximum range reach the radar after a transit\ntime $t_{dm}$ as shown in Fig. [fig:FMCW waveform](c).\n\nWe note that there is a constant difference in frequency between the\ntransmitted and received signals and this will be true for all targets\nafter time $t_{s}$ until $t_{e}$. We conclude from\nFig. [fig:FMCW waveform] that the frequency difference is given by\n\n$$f_{d}=S\\times t_{d}=\\frac{2SR}{v},$$\n\nwhere $T_{eff}=t_{e}-t_{s}=\\frac{N}{f_{s}}$ is the effective sweep duration\nof the radar. The frequency excursion of the sweep during $T_{eff}$ is\nthe effective bandwidth of the radar, given by\n\n$$B_{eff}=f_{max}-f_{1}=ST_{eff}.$$\n\nWe will see that the range resolution of the radar is determined by\nthe effective bandwidth.\n\n\nReturning to Fig. [fig: block-diagram], the signal produced by the\nreceiver at the input to the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) when\nthere is a single target is a sinusoid with constant amplitude,\nproportional to the amplitude of the echo, and constant frequency,\nproportional to the range to the target.\n\n-->\n<p><img src=\"../figures/FMCW_waveform.png\" alt=\"The frequency relationships in an FMCW radar with\n linear frequency modulation\"></p>\n<p>To start off, we'll generate some synthetic signals, after which we'll\nturn our focus to the output of an actual radar.</p>\n<p>Recall that the radar is increasing its frequency as it transmits at a\nrate of $S$ Hz/s.

There is a dramatic\nlowering in side lobe level, but at a price: the peaks have changed in\nshape, widening and becoming less peaky, thus lowering the radar\nresolution, that is, the ability of the radar to distinguish between\ntwo closely space targets. The choice of window is a compromise\nbetween side lobe level and resolution. Even so, referring to the\ntrace for $V_\\mathrm{sim}$, windowing has dramatically increased our\nability to distinguish the small target from its large neighbor.</p>\n<p>In the real radar data range trace windowing has also reduced the side\nlobes. This is most visible in the depth of the notch between the two\ngroups of targets.</p>\n<h3>Radar Images</h3>\n<p>Knowing how to analyze a single trace, we can expand to looking at\nradar images.</p>\n<p>The data is produced by a radar with a parabolic reflector antenna. It\nproduces a highly directive round pencil beam with a $2^\\circ$\nspreading angle between half-power points. When directed with normal\nincidence at a plane, the radar will illuminate a spot of about $2$ meters in\ndiameter at a distance of 60 meters.\nOutside this spot, the power drops off quite rapidly, but strong\nechoes from outside the spot will nevertheless still be visible.</p>\n<p>By varying the pencil beam's azimuth (left-right position) and\nelevation (up-down position), we can sweep it across the target area\nof interest. When reflections are picked up, we can calculate the\ndistance to the reflector (the object hit by the radar signal).\nTogether with the current pencil beam azimuth and elevation, this\ndefines the reflector's position in 3D.</p>\n<p>A rock slope consists of thousands of reflectors. A range bin can be\nthought of as a large sphere with the radar at its center that\nintersects the slope along a ragged line. The scatterers on this line\nwill produce reflections in this range bin. The wavelength of the\nradar (distance the transmitted wave travels in one oscillation\nsecond) is about 30 mm. The reflections from scatterers separated by\nodd multiples of a quarter wavelength in range, about 7.5 mm, will\ntend to interfere destructively, while those from scatterers separated\nby multiples of a half wavelength will tend to interfere\nconstructively at the radar. The reflections combine to produce\napparent spots of strong reflections. This specific radar moves its\nantenna in order to scan small regions consisting of $20^\\circ$\nazimuth and $30^\\circ$ elevation bins scanned in steps of $0.5^\\circ$.</p>\n<p>We will now draw some contour plots of the resulting radar data.\nPlease refer to the diagram below to see how the different slices are\ntaken. A first slice at fixed range shows the strength of echoes\nagainst elevation and azimuth. Another two slices at fixed elevation\nand azimuth respectively shows the slope.

For example, any voice assistant detects, authenticates and interprets commands from humans even if it is slow or fast. Our voice tone tends to be different during different times of the day. In the early morning after we get up from bed, we interact with a slower, heavier and lazier tone compared to other times of the day. These devices treat the signals as time series and compare the peaks, troughs and slopes by taking into account the varying lags and phases in the signals to come up with a similarity score. One of the most common algorithms used to accomplish this is <em>Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)</em>. It is a very robust technique to compare two or more Time Series by ignoring any shifts and speed.</p>\n<p>As part of Walmart Real Estate team, I am working on understanding the energy consumption pattern of different assets like refrigeration units, dehumidifiers, lighting, etc. installed in the retail stores.This will help in improving quality of data collected from IoT sensors, detect and prevent faults in the systems and improve energy consumption forecasting and planning. This analysis involves time series of energy consumption during different times of a day i.e. different days of a week, weeks of a month and months of a year. Time series forecasting often gives bad predictions when there is sudden shift in phase of the energy consumption due to unknown factors. For example if the defrost schedule, items refresh routine for a refrigeration unit, or weather changes suddenly and are not captured to explain the phase shifts of energy consumption, it is important to detect these change points.</p>\n<p>In the example below, the items refresh routine of a store has shifted by 2 hours on Tuesday leading the shift in peak energy consumption of refrigeration units and this information was not available to us for many such stores.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*WEe7LQivzU4YOvDCe0_P_A.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*WEe7LQivzU4YOvDCe0_P_A.png\"></p>\n<p>The peak at 2 am got shifted to 4 am.

The setup improved the predictions substantially ( > 50%) for the stores for which the reason of shift was not known. This was not possible by traditional ways of one to one comparison of signals.</p>\n<p>In this blog, I will explain how DTW algorithm works and throw some light on the calculation of the similarity score between two time series and its implementation in python. Most of the contents in this blog have been sourced from this <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1163055\">paper</a>, also mentioned in the references section below.</p>\n<p>2. Why do we need DTW ?</p>\n<p>Any two time series can be compared using euclidean distance or other similar distances on a one to one basis on time axis. The amplitude of first time series at time T will be compared with amplitude of second time series at time T. This will result into a very poor comparison and similarity score even if the two time series are very similar in shape but out of phase in time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*HQleh0-1HlGsLkVlcaFRLw.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*HQleh0-1HlGsLkVlcaFRLw.png\"></p>\n<p>DTW compares amplitude of first signal at time T with amplitude of second signal at time T+1 and T-1 or T+2 and T-2.

It is a method to calculate the optimal matching between two sequences. DTW is useful in many domains such as speech recognition, data mining, financial markets, etc. It's commonly used in data mining to measure the distance between two time-series.</p>\n<p>In this post, we will go over the mathematics behind DTW. Then, two illustrative examples are provided to better understand the concept. If you are not interested in the math behind it, please jump to examples.</p>\n<h1>Formulation</h1>\n<p>Let's assume we have two sequences like the following:</p>\n<p><em>𝑋=𝑥[1], 𝑥[2], ..., x[i], ..., x[n]</em></p>\n<p><em>Y=y[1], y[2], ..., y[j], ..., y[m]</em></p>\n<p>The sequences 𝑋 and 𝑌 can be arranged to form an 𝑛-by-𝑚 grid, where each point (𝑖, j) is the alignment between 𝑥[𝑖] and 𝑦[𝑗].</p>\n<p>A warping path 𝑊 maps the elements of 𝑋 and 𝑌 to minimize the <em>distance</em> between them. 𝑊 is a sequence of grid points (𝑖, 𝑗). We will see an example of the warping path later.</p>\n<h2>Warping Path and DTW distance</h2>\n<p>The Optimal path to (𝑖<em>𝑘, 𝑗</em>𝑘) can be computed by:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*8hJEJWuxrccwCMuUG_aPbQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*8hJEJWuxrccwCMuUG_aPbQ.png\"></p>\n<p>where 𝑑 is the Euclidean distance. Then, the overall path cost can be calculated as</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2OGDOJ-a0zTO_9T1FIGejQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/272/1*2OGDOJ-a0zTO_9T1FIGejQ.png\"></p>\n<h1>Restrictions on the Warping function</h1>\n<p>The warping path is found using a dynamic programming approach to align two sequences. Going through all possible paths is \"combinatorically explosive\" [1]. Therefore, for efficiency purposes, it's important to limit the number of possible warping paths, and hence the following constraints are outlined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boundary Condition: This constraint ensures that the warping path begins with the start points of both signals and terminates with their endpoints.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SHsmQu2TqpaDyIArn2snzg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/452/1*SHsmQu2TqpaDyIArn2snzg.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monotonicity condition: This constraint preserves the time-order of points (not going back in time).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*RNg2VENGaWoyvGrvyeg61A.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/311/1*RNg2VENGaWoyvGrvyeg61A.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuity (step size) condition: This constraint limits the path transitions to adjacent points in time (not jumping in time).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lU99pFyomdPeaHuR26bDyA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/418/1*lU99pFyomdPeaHuR26bDyA.png\"></p>\n<p>In addition to the above three constraints, there are other less frequent conditions for an allowable warping path:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Warping window condition: Allowable points can be restricted to fall within a given warping window of width 𝜔 (a positive integer).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9apgwkXeU3gOHLudFsIosA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/168/1*9apgwkXeU3gOHLudFsIosA.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slope condition: The warping path can be constrained by restricting the slope, and consequently avoiding extreme movements in one direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An acceptable warping path has combinations of chess king moves that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Horizontal moves: (𝑖, 𝑗) → (𝑖, 𝑗+1)</li>\n<li>Vertical moves: (𝑖, 𝑗) → (𝑖+1, 𝑗)</li>\n<li>Diagonal moves: (𝑖, 𝑗) → (𝑖+1, 𝑗+1)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Implementation</h1>\n<p>Let's import all python packages we need.</p>\n<p>import pandas as pd<br>\nimport numpy as np# Plotting Packages<br>\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>\nimport seaborn as sbn# Configuring Matplotlib<br>\nimport matplotlib as mpl<br>\nmpl.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 300<br>\nsavefig<em>options = dict(format=\"png\", dpi=300, bbox</em>inches=\"tight\")# Computation packages<br>\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean<br>\nfrom fastdtw import fastdtw</p>\n<p>Let's define a method to compute the accumulated cost matrix <em>D</em> for the warp path. The cost matrix uses the Euclidean distance to calculate the distance between every two points. The methods to compute the Euclidean distance matrix and accumulated cost matrix are defined below:</p>\n<h1>Example 1</h1>\n<p>In this example, we have two sequences <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> with different lengths.</p>\n<h1>Create two sequences\\</h1>\n<p>x = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1]<br>\ny = [2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 0]</p>\n<p>We cannot calculate the Euclidean distance between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> since they don't have equal lengths.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ADzLGLGGq13onO72EO_ZpQ.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*ADzLGLGGq13onO72EO_ZpQ.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 1: Euclidean distance between x and y (is it possible? 🤔) (Image by Author)</p>\n<h1>Compute DTW distance and warp path</h1>\n<p>Many Python packages calculate the DTW by just providing the sequences and the type of distance (usually Euclidean). Here, we use a popular Python implementation of DTW that is <a href=\"https://github.com/slaypni/fastdtw\">FastDTW</a> which is an approximate DTW algorithm with lower time and memory complexities [2].</p>\n<p>dtw<em>distance, warp</em>path = fastdtw(x, y, dist=euclidean)</p>\n<p>Note that we are using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/scipy/\">SciPy</a>'s distance function <em>Euclidean</em> that we imported earlier. For a better understanding of the warp path, let's first compute the accumulated cost matrix and then visualize the path on a grid. The following code will plot a heatmap of the accumulated cost matrix.</p>\n<p>cost<em>matrix = compute</em>accumulated<em>cost</em>matrix(x, y)</p>\n<p>Example 1: Python code to plot (and save) the heatmap of the accumulated cost matrix</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/54/1*PIKZAwsV15NBvqkh9N1KMg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/375/1*PIKZAwsV15NBvqkh9N1KMg.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 1: Accumulated cost matrix and warping path (Image by Author)</p>\n<p>The color bar shows the cost of each point in the grid. As can be seen, the warp path (blue line) is going through the lowest cost on the grid. Let's see the DTW distance and the warping path by printing these two variables.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DTW distance: 6.0<br>\nWarp path: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The warping path starts at point (0, 0) and ends at (4, 6) by 6 moves. Let's also calculate the accumulated cost most using the functions we defined earlier and compare the values with the heatmap.</p>\n<p>cost<em>matrix = compute</em>accumulated<em>cost</em>matrix(x, y)<br>\nprint(np.flipud(cost_matrix)) # Flipping the cost matrix for easier comparison with heatmap values!>>> [[32. 12. 10. 10.  6.]<br>\n[23. 11.  6.  6.  5.]<br>\n[19. 11.  5.  5.  9.]<br>\n[19.  7.  4.  5.  8.]<br>\n[19.  3.  6. 10.  4.]<br>\n[10.  2.  6.  6.  3.]<br>\n[ 1.  2.  2.  2.  3.]]</p>\n<p>The cost matrix is printed above has similar values to the heatmap.</p>\n<p>Now let's plot the two sequences and connect the mapping points. The code to plot the DTW distance between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is given below.</p>\n<p>Example 1: Python code to plot (and save) the DTW distance between x and y</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bF9I-49iVW9b2MvDbRBZxA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*bF9I-49iVW9b2MvDbRBZxA.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 1: DTW distance between x and y (Image by Author)</p>\n<h1>Example 2</h1>\n<p>In this example, we will use two sinusoidal signals and see how they will be matched by calculating the DTW distance between them.</p>\n<p>Example 2: Generate two sinusoidal signals (x1 and x2) with different lengths</p>\n<p>Just like Example 1, let's calculate the DTW distance and the warp path for *x1 *and *x2 *signals using FastDTW package.</p>\n<p>distance, warp_path = fastdtw(x1, x2, dist=euclidean)</p>\n<p>Example 2: Python code to plot (and save) the DTW distance between x1 and x2</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Bzubc5uGFXd_-Sj7W_QFjg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*Bzubc5uGFXd_-Sj7W_QFjg.png\"></p>\n<p>Example 2: DTW distance between x1 and x2 (Image by Author)</p>\n<p>As can be seen in above figure, the DTW distance between the two signals is particularly powerful when the signals have similar patterns. The extrema (maximum and minimum points) between the two signals are correctly mapped. Moreover, unlike Euclidean distance, we may see many-to-one mapping when DTW distance is used, particularly if the two signals have different lengths.</p>\n<p>You may spot an issue with dynamic time warping from the figure above. Can you guess what it is?</p>\n<p>The issue is around the head and tail of time-series that do not properly match. This is because the DTW algorithm cannot afford the warping invariance for at the endpoints. In short, the effect of this is that a small difference at the sequence endpoints will tend to contribute disproportionately to the estimated similarity[3].</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>DTW is an algorithm to find an optimal alignment between two sequences and a useful distance metric to have in our toolbox. This technique is useful when we are working with two non-linear sequences, particularly if one sequence is a non-linear stretched/shrunk version of the other. The warping path is a combination of \"chess king\" moves that starts from the head of two sequences and ends with their tails.</p>\n<p>You can find the Jupyter notebook for this blog post <a href=\"https://github.com/e-alizadeh/medium/blob/master/notebooks/intro_to_dtw.ipynb\">here</a>.

Dynamic Time Warping is used to compare the similarity or calculate the distance between two arrays or time series with different length.</p>\n<p>Suppose we want to calculate the distance of two equal-length arrays:</p>\n<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>\nb = [3, 2, 2]</p>\n<p>How to do that? One obvious way is to match up <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in 1-to-1 fashion and sum up the total distance of each component. This sounds easy, but what if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have different lengths?</p>\n<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>\nb = [2, 2, 2, 3, 4]</p>\n<p>How to match them up? Which should map to which? To solve the problem, there comes dynamic time warping. Just as its name indicates, to warp the series so that they can match up.</p>\n<h1>Use Cases</h1>\n<p>Before digging into the algorithm, you might have the question that is it useful? Do we really need to compare the distance between two unequal-length time series?</p>\n<p>Yes, in a lot of scenarios DTW is playing a key role.</p>\n<h2>Sound Pattern Recognition</h2>\n<p>One use case is to detect the sound pattern of the same kind. Suppose we want to recognise the voice of a person by analysing his sound track, and we are able to collect his sound track of saying <code>Hello</code> in one scenario. However, people speak in the same word in different ways, what if he speaks hello in a much slower pace like <code>Heeeeeeelloooooo</code> , we will need an algorithm to match up the sound track of different lengths and be able to identify they come from the same person.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*gi1TtOqFCsb2M_U7iAUAag.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*gi1TtOqFCsb2M_U7iAUAag.png\"></p>\n<h2>Stock Market</h2>\n<p>In a stock market, people always hope to be able to predict the future, however using general machine learning algorithms can be exhaustive, as most prediction task requires test and training set to have the same dimension of features. However, if you ever speculate in the stock market, you will know that even the same pattern of a stock can have very different length reflection on klines and indicators.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*4QUO4Tqm_z-8ydMBGgqmPg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*4QUO4Tqm_z-8ydMBGgqmPg.png\"></p>\n<h1>Definition &#x26; Idea</h1>\n<p>A concise explanation of DTW from wiki,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In time series analysis, dynamic time warping (DTW) is one of the algorithms for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed. DTW has been applied to temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphics data --- indeed, any data that can be turned into a linear sequence can be analysed with DTW.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>The idea to compare arrays with different length is to build one-to-many and many-to-one matches so that the total distance can be minimised between the two.</em></p>\n<p>Suppose we have two different arrays red and blue with different length:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/42/1*uFicSZjqkNBfsyrsJw7J9g.jpeg?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/612/1*uFicSZjqkNBfsyrsJw7J9g.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>Clearly these two series follow the same pattern, but the blue curve is longer than the red. If we apply the one-to-one match, shown in the top, the mapping is not perfectly synced up and the tail of the blue curve is being left out.</p>\n<p>DTW overcomes the issue by developing a one-to-many match so that the troughs and peaks with the same pattern are perfectly matched, and there is no left out for both curves(shown in the bottom top).</p>\n<h1>Rules</h1>\n<p>In general, DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g. time series) with certain restriction and rules(comes from wiki):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every index from the first sequence must be matched with one or more indices from the other sequence and vice versa</li>\n<li>The first index from the first sequence must be matched with the first index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)</li>\n<li>The last index from the first sequence must be matched with the last index from the other sequence (but it does not have to be its only match)</li>\n<li>The mapping of the indices from the first sequence to indices from the other sequence must be monotonically increasing, and vice versa, i.e. if <code>j > i</code> are indices from the first sequence, then there must not be two indices <code>l > k</code> in the other sequence, such that index <code>i</code> is matched with index <code>l</code> and index <code>j</code> is matched with index <code>k</code> , and vice versa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The optimal match is denoted by the match that satisfies all the restrictions and the rules and that has the minimal cost, where the cost is computed as the sum of absolute differences, for each matched pair of indices, between their values.</p>\n<p>To summarise is that <em>head and tail must be positionally matched, no cross-match and no left out.</em></p>\n<h1>Implementation</h1>\n<p>The implementation of the algorithm looks extremely concise:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*fGr2Mj7fEB7tEyqAzcp2LA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*fGr2Mj7fEB7tEyqAzcp2LA.png\"></p>\n<p>where <code>DTW[i, j]</code> is the distance between <code>s[1:i]</code> and <code>t[1:j]</code> with the best alignment.</p>\n<p>The key lies in:</p>\n<p>DTW[i, j] := cost + minimum(DTW[i-1, j ],<br>\nDTW[i , j-1],<br>\nDTW[i-1, j-1])</p>\n<p>Which is saying that the cost of between two arrays with length <code>i and j</code> equals <em>the distance between the tails + the minimum of cost in arrays with length *`</em>i-1, j<em><code>_ , _</code></em>i, j-1<em><code>_ , and _</code></em>i-1, j-1*`_ ._</p>\n<p>Put it in python would be:</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*eogOkXkOUzi6Cq7U9BgiLg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*eogOkXkOUzi6Cq7U9BgiLg.png\"></p>\n<p>The distance between <code>a and b</code> would be the last element of the matrix, which is 2.</p>\n<h2>Add Window Constraint</h2>\n<p>One issue of the above algorithm is that we allow one element in an array to match an unlimited number of elements in the other array(as long as the tail can match in the end), this would cause the mapping to bent over a lot, for example, the following array:</p>\n<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>\nb = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, ..., 5]</p>\n<p>To minimise the distance, the element 2 in array <code>a</code> would match all the 2 in array <code>b</code> , which causes an array <code>b</code> to bent severely. To avoid this, we can add a window constraint to limit the number of elements one can match:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*0_xypte7FHDWJuuBexEvHg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*0_xypte7FHDWJuuBexEvHg.png\"></p>\n<p>The key difference is that now each element is confined to match elements in range <code>i --- w</code> and <code>i + w</code> . The <code>w := max(w, abs(n-m))</code> guarantees all indices can be matched up.</p>\n<p>The implementation and example would be:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2K6C-3QrRmbbhpe-jt9UQA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*2K6C-3QrRmbbhpe-jt9UQA.png\"></p>\n<h1>Apply a Package</h1>\n<p>There is also contributed packages available on Pypi to use directly.

Basic audio operations are performed with <strong>audio nodes</strong>, which are linked together to form an <strong>audio routing graph</strong>. Several sources --- with different types of channel layout --- are supported even within a single context. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.</p>\n<p>Audio nodes are linked via their inputs and outputs, forming a chain that starts with one or more sources, goes through one or more nodes, then ends up at a destination. Although, you don't have to provide a destination if you, say, just want to visualize some audio data. A simple, typical workflow for web audio would look something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create the audio context.</li>\n<li>Inside the context, create sources --- such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio\"><code>&#x3C;audio></code></a>, oscillator, or stream.</li>\n<li>Create effects nodes, such as reverb, biquad filter, panner, or compressor.</li>\n<li>Choose the final destination for the audio, such as the user's computer speakers.</li>\n<li>Establish connections from the audio sources through zero or more effects, eventually ending at the chosen destination.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The number of audio channels available on a signal is frequently presented in a numeric format, such as 2.0 or 5.1. This is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surround_sound#Channel_notation\" title=\"channel notation\">channel notation</a>. The first number is the number of full frequency range audio channels that the signal includes. The number after the period indicates the number of those channels which are reserved for low-frequency effect (LFE) outputs; these are often referred to as <strong>subwoofers</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API/webaudioapi_en.svg\" alt=\"A simple box diagram with an outer box labeled Audio context, and three inner boxes labeled Sources, Effects and Destination.

A frame, or sample frame, is the set of all values for all channels that will play at a specific point in time: all the samples of all the channels that play at the same time (two for a stereo sound, six for 5.1, etc.)</p>\n<p>The sample rate is the number of those samples (or frames, since all samples of a frame play at the same time) that will play in one second, measured in Hz. The higher the sample rate, the better the sound quality.</p>\n<p>Let's look at a Mono and a Stereo audio buffer, each is one second long, and playing at 44100Hz:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Mono buffer will have 44100 samples, and 44100 frames. The <code>length</code> property will be 44100.</li>\n<li>The Stereo buffer will have 88200 samples, but still 44100 frames. The <code>length</code> property will still be 44100 since it's equal to the number of frames.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API/sampleframe-english.png\" alt=\"A diagram showing several frames in an audio buffer in a long line, each one containing two samples, as the buffer has two channels, it is stereo.\"></p>\n<p>When a buffer plays, you will hear the left most sample frame, and then the one right next to it, etc. In the case of stereo, you will hear both channels at the same time. Sample frames are very useful, because they are independent of the number of channels, and represent time, in a useful way for doing precise audio manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> To get a time in seconds from a frame count, divide the number of frames by the sample rate. To get a number of frames from a number of samples, divide by the channel count.</p>\n<p>Here's a couple of simple examples:</p>\n<pre><code>var context = new AudioContext();\nvar buffer = context.createBuffer(2, 22050, 44100);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio\" title=\"Digital audio\">digital audio</a>, <strong>44,100 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz\">Hz</a></strong> (alternately represented as <strong>44.1 kHz</strong>) is a common <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_frequency\" title=\"Sampling frequency\">sampling frequency</a>. Why 44.1kHz?</p>\n<p>Firstly, because the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range\" title=\"Hearing range\">hearing range</a> of human ears is roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Via the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem\" title=\"Nyquist--Shannon sampling theorem\">Nyquist--Shannon sampling theorem</a>, the sampling frequency must be greater than twice the maximum frequency one wishes to reproduce. Therefore, the sampling rate has to be greater than 40 kHz.</p>\n<p>Secondly, signals must be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter\" title=\"Low-pass filter\">low-pass filtered</a> before sampling, otherwise <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing\">aliasing</a> occurs. While an ideal low-pass filter would perfectly pass frequencies below 20 kHz (without attenuating them) and perfectly cut off frequencies above 20 kHz, in practice a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_band\" title=\"Transition band\">transition band</a> is necessary, where frequencies are partly attenuated. The wider this transition band is, the easier and more economical it is to make an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing_filter\" title=\"Anti-aliasing filter\">anti-aliasing filter</a>. The 44.1 kHz sampling frequency allows for a 2.05 kHz transition band.</p>\n<p>If you use this call above, you will get a stereo buffer with two channels, that when played back on an AudioContext running at 44100Hz (very common, most normal sound cards run at this rate), will last for 0.5 seconds: 22050 frames/44100Hz = 0.5 seconds.</p>\n<pre><code>var context = new AudioContext();\nvar buffer = context.createBuffer(1, 22050, 22050);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you use this call, you will get a mono buffer with just one channel), that when played back on an AudioContext running at 44100Hz, will be automatically <em>resampled</em> to 44100Hz (and therefore yield 44100 frames), and last for 1.0 second: 44100 frames/44100Hz = 1 second.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Audio resampling is very similar to image resizing. Say you've got a 16 x 16 image, but you want it to fill a 32x32 area. You resize (or resample) it. The result has less quality (it can be blurry or edgy, depending on the resizing algorithm), but it works, with the resized image taking up less space. Resampled audio is exactly the same: you save space, but in practice you will be unable to properly reproduce high frequency content, or treble sound.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#planar_versus_interleaved_buffers\" title=\"Permalink to Planar versus interleaved buffers\">Planar versus interleaved buffers</a></h3>\n<p>The Web Audio API uses a planar buffer format. The left and right channels are stored like this:</p>\n<p>LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR (for a buffer of 16 frames)</p>\n<p>This is very common in audio processing: it makes it easy to process each channel independently.</p>\n<p>The alternative is to use an interleaved buffer format:</p>\n<p>LRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLR (for a buffer of 16 frames)</p>\n<p>This format is very common for storing and playing back audio without much processing, for example a decoded MP3 stream.</p>\n<p>The Web Audio API exposes <strong>only</strong> planar buffers, because it's made for processing. It works with planar, but converts the audio to interleaved when it is sent to the sound card for playback. Conversely, when an MP3 is decoded, it starts off in interleaved format, but is converted to planar for processing.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#audio_channels\" title=\"Permalink to Audio channels\">Audio channels</a></h2>\n<p>Different audio buffers contain different numbers of channels: from the more basic mono (only one channel) and stereo (left and right channels), to more complex sets like quad and 5.1, which have different sound samples contained in each channel, leading to a richer sound experience. The channels are usually represented by standard abbreviations detailed in the table below:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Channels</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Mono</em></td>\n<td><code>0: M: mono</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Stereo</em></td>\n<td><code>0: L: left 1: R: right</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Quad</em></td>\n<td><code>0: L: left 1: R: right 2: SL: surround left 3: SR: surround right</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>5.1</em></td>\n<td><code>0: L: left 1: R: right 2: C: center 3: LFE: subwoofer 4: SL: surround left 5: SR: surround right</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#up-mixing_and_down-mixing\" title=\"Permalink to Up-mixing and down-mixing\">Up-mixing and down-mixing</a></h3>\n<p>When the number of channels doesn't match between an input and an output, up- or down-mixing happens according the following rules. This can be somewhat controlled by setting the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioNode/channelInterpretation\"><code>AudioNode.channelInterpretation</code></a> property to <code>speakers</code> or <code>discrete</code>:</p>\n<h1>Web Audio API</h1>\n<p>The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API#web_audio_concepts_and_usage\" title=\"Permalink to Web audio concepts and usage\">Web audio concepts and usage</a></h2>\n<p>The Web Audio API involves handling audio operations inside an <strong>audio context</strong>, and has been designed to allow <strong>modular routing</strong>.

Several sources --- with different types of channel layout --- are supported even within a single context. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.</p>\n<p>Audio nodes are linked into chains and simple webs by their inputs and outputs. They typically start with one or more sources. Sources provide arrays of sound intensities (samples) at very small timeslices, often tens of thousands of them per second. These could be either computed mathematically (such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode\"><code>OscillatorNode</code></a>), or they can be recordings from sound/video files (like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode\"><code>AudioBufferSourceNode</code></a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaElementAudioSourceNode\"><code>MediaElementAudioSourceNode</code></a>) and audio streams (<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamAudioSourceNode\"><code>MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</code></a>). In fact, sound files are just recordings of sound intensities themselves, which come in from microphones or electric instruments, and get mixed down into a single, complicated wave.</p>\n<p>Outputs of these nodes could be linked to inputs of others, which mix or modify these streams of sound samples into different streams. A common modification is multiplying the samples by a value to make them louder or quieter (as is the case with <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GainNode\"><code>GainNode</code></a>). Once the sound has been sufficiently processed for the intended effect, it can be linked to the input of a destination (<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/destination\"><code>BaseAudioContext.destination</code></a>), which sends the sound to the speakers or headphones. This last connection is only necessary if the user is supposed to hear the audio.</p>\n<p>A simple, typical workflow for web audio would look something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create audio context</li>\n<li>Inside the context, create sources --- such as <code>&#x3C;audio></code>, oscillator, stream</li>\n<li>Create effects nodes, such as reverb, biquad filter, panner, compressor</li>\n<li>Choose final destination of audio, for example your system speakers</li>\n<li>Connect the sources up to the effects, and the effects to the destination.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/audio-context_.png\" alt=\"A simple box diagram with an outer box labeled Audio context, and three inner boxes labeled Sources, Effects and Destination.

There were times I had to restart Chrome to get Hangouts to work again.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Request for the option to interview over Hangouts/Skype instead of a phone call; it is easier to send links or text across.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Decide on and be familiar with a programming language.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Familiarize yourself with the coding environment (CoderPad/CodePen). Set up the coding shortcuts, turn on autocompletion, tab spacing, etc.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Prepare answers to the <a href=\"behavioral-questions.md\">frequently-asked behavioral questions</a> in an interview.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Prepare some <a href=\"questions-to-ask.md\">questions to ask</a> at the end of the interview.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Dress comfortably. Usually you do not need to wear smart clothes, casual should be fine. T-shirts and jeans are acceptable at most places.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Stay calm and composed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>⚠️</td>\n<td>Turn off the webcam if possible. Most remote interviews will not require video chat and leaving it on only serves as a distraction.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Things</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Introduce yourself in a few sentences under a minute or two.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Mention interesting points that are relevant to the role you are applying for.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Sound enthusiastic!

Many questions are under-specified on purpose. E.g. a tree-like diagram could very well be a graph that allows for cycles and a naive recursive solution would not work.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Clarify input format and range.

Too slow is no good.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>As much as possible, write actual compilable code, not pseudocode.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Write in a modular fashion. Extract out chunks of repeated code into functions.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Ask for permission to use trivial functions without having to implement them; saves you some time.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Use the hints given by the interviewer.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Demonstrate mastery of your chosen programming language.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>Demonstrate technical knowledge in data structures and algorithms.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>✅</td>\n<td>If you are cutting corners in your code, state that out loud to your interviewer and say what you would do in a non-interview setting (no time constraints).

Developers","weight":0,"excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>1. Why are frameworks useful?</h2>\n<p>Essentially the allure of these is the amount of time that is saved and the resulting efficiency in getting a project rolled out faster because there's a lot less of the initial work to be done.</p>\n<p>Frameworks take care of tasks like default browser settings, file structures, and layout templates for your website. This automation generates a uniform design for page elements like text, tables, forms, and buttons, amongst other things. Even complex navigation menus become standardized with frameworks as it can be consistently applied across your website with ease.</p>\n<h2>2. Types of framework</h2>\n<p>There are many different kinds of this platform available for programmers. Typically, like a lot of things within this discipline can be split between <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/whats-the-difference-between-frontend-and-backend/\">frontend and backend development</a>---first let's make the distinction between the two to help you understand the usefulness of these solutions.</p>\n<h3>Backend frameworks</h3>\n<p>These are designed to make the responsibility of interacting with the database an easier endeavor for the developer. It automates a lot of functions and processes that web developers use to record and retrieve user-inputted data.</p>\n<h3>Frontend frameworks</h3>\n<p>As the name suggests, these are very helpful on the presentation side of the website, creating a good foundation from which to build pages. These frameworks combine HTML, CSS, and <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-javascript/\">Javascript</a> to be really effective in creating conventions for various elements. Typically frontend web developers use them in conjunction with <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/7-essential-tools-for-front-end-development/\">other effective tools</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-html-a-beginners-guide/\">HTML</a> conventions allow for standardization for elements like typography, while <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-css/\">CSS</a> conventions can help standardize positioning of elements in a grid-like system on the pages. This makes it easier for the developer to arrange and organize elements into a simple and uniform design across multiple displays and browsers. Javascript conventions offer the ability to style more advanced components like image carousels, lightboxes, button behaviors, and pop-ups.</p>\n<p>On another note, there are Javascript frameworks that focus on full application support---like AngularJS and Reactjs. Libraries of Javascript code like <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/javascript-vs-jquery-whats-the-difference/\">jQuery</a> are also helpful in developing conventions that can be readily implemented in websites.</p>\n<p>To recap, the use of these tools helps the developer get up and running quickly without having to get bogged down with the initial hurdles that come with setting up a website. It creates uniform code across all pages of your website and presents a clean look for users. This in turn solves common issues like typography consistency and positioning difficulties on different pages.</p>\n<p>Best of all, frontend frameworks resolve any issues with browser compatibility and are key to responsive web design, which we'll discuss further on.</p>\n<h4>Curious about a career in Web Development?</h4>\n<p>Start learning for free!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/short-courses/become-a-web-developer/?popup-tracking=blog-inline-DEV\"><img src=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/web-image@3x.jpg\"></a></p>\n<h2>3. Popular frameworks</h2>\n<p>There are many of these tools that have become must-haves for beginner and expert web developers alike. As well as different languages, they focus on different directives and outcomes.</p>\n<p>One of the most popular frameworks is <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-bootstrap-a-beginners-guide/\">Bootstrap, which was originally developed by Twitter</a> to maintain consistency in their interface development. It's very polished and efficient, and makes website development easier and faster. It has standardized conventions that are well recognized for HTML elements like buttons, alerts, forms, and typography.</p>\n<p>So popular that it's now known simply as \"Rails,\" <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/should-i-learn-ruby-on-rails/\">Ruby on Rails </a>has revolutionised this language. As well as making it one of the <a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/easiest-programming-languages/\">easier programming languages to learn</a>, Rails is particularly popular with beginners looking to code full-stack early on in their careers.</p>\n<p>Foundation was created from the Zurb style guide and much like Bootstrap, offers a complete solution for front-end design. Many large companies like Facebook, Yahoo, and Ebay utilize Foundation in their layouts. The framework encourages web developers to expand on the conventions and personalize them for developers' websites.</p>\n<p>Skeleton is a lighter example that doesn't come with all the bells and whistles that accompany the heavy-lifters like Bootstrap and Foundation. This encourages greater customization by only providing styling on the most basic and necessary elements. Developers who only need specific components to be styled utilize light-weight frameworks like Skeleton to achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>A simple Google search will turn up a lot of results for top tools being used and recommended. It's definitely beneficial to check out the different options and see which suits your development needs and design goals.</p>\n<h2>4. How do I use frameworks?</h2>\n<p>Regardless of whether a developer uses a full frontend framework like Bootstrap or a lightweight option like Skeleton, these are efficient tools that should be seriously considered in every developer's process.</p>\n<p>Recognized frameworks offer more ease in collaboration as developers can access the same libraries for design conventions without having to resort to individual opinionated decisions. Additionally, there is support from the specific community with tutorials and articles on how to effectively use it.</p>\n<p>The ease of implementation and efficiency makes it almost a necessity to employ these tools in a web developer's process. Any time a programmer is finding themselves creating an ever-growing proprietary list of CSS rules, it's probably a good idea to look into using a framework to tidy things up.</p>\n<h2>5. What is a responsive framework?</h2>\n<p>One of the best features of these systems is that they help create websites that are easily accessible and are able to be viewed across different browsers on different devices. A lot of frameworks accomplish this with dynamic code---utilizing classes that can be reused and formatted to take into consideration the device and/or browser that is being used.</p>\n<p>In other words, the layouts of webpages will change---certain elements will disappear and text will be smaller on smaller screens, while certain Javascript elements might not take effect at all. On larger screens, the extra real estate can be used to showcase higher quality images and more sophisticated design elements, as well as allowing for the white space beloved by web designers.</p>\n<p>In this current age when users are <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/\">more likely to view websites on their mobile devices</a> than their computers, it's important to have a mobile responsive website that creates an enriching user experience no matter what interface the user interacts with. In this video, our in-house web developer Abhi explains more about styling a mobile-responsive website with CSS:</p>\n<h2>6. Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>Critics of frontend frameworks cite them as the source of a lot of cookie-cutter websites that are identical in appearance and interaction. This however, is an oversimplification. Why? Let's go back to the cooking example: a spatula is just a spatula---a lot of people have one and use the tool in the kitchen. But the food that is created will vary wildly across the spectrum, depending on the cook.</p>\n<p>In the same light, frontend frameworks are simply a tool that can be employed to create diverse and distinctive websites. Yes they're efficient, but it's up to the developer to make sure they're effective.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn some more about web development right now, these articles may interest you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/best-coding-bootcamps/\">A Guide To The Best Web Development Bootcamps And How To Choose One</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/in-demand-web-developer-skills/\">The Most In-Demand Web Developer Skills in 2021</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/5-latest-trends-in-web-development/\">5 Web Development Trends To Watch This Year</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"url":"/docs/community/","relativePath":"docs/community/index.md","relativeDir":"docs/community","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Community","excerpt":"We'd love it if you participate in the Libris community.

As for most of the things in life, you can't have it all, so it is with the data structures. You will generally need to trade some time for space or the other way around.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><em>time</em></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The time complexity for a data structure is in general more diverse than its space complexity.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><em>Several operations</em></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In contrary to algorithms, when you look at the time complexity for data structures you need to express it for several operations that you can do with data structures. It can be adding elements, deleting elements, accessing an element or even searching for an element.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><em>Dependent on data</em></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Something that data structure and algorithms have in common when talking about time complexity is that they are both dealing with data. When you deal with data you become dependent on them and as a result the time complexity is also dependent of the data that you received. To solve this problem we talk about 3 different time complexity.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The best-case complexity: when the data looks the best</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The worst-case complexity: when the data looks the worst</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The average-case complexity: when the data looks average</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Big O notation</h2>\n<p>The complexity is usually expressed with the Big O notation. The wikipedia page about this subject is pretty complex but you can find here a good summary of the different complexity for the most famous data structures and sorting algorithms.</p>\n<h2>The Array data structure</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*Qk3UYgeqXamRrFLR.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Definition</h2>\n<p>An Array data structure, or simply an Array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.

The main differences are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>page queries can accept variables (via <code>pageContext</code>) but can only be added to <em>page</em> components</li>\n<li>StaticQuery does not accept variables (hence the name \"static\"), but can be used in <em>any</em> component, including pages</li>\n<li>StaticQuery does not work with raw React.createElement calls; please use JSX, e.g. <code>&#x3C;StaticQuery /></code></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>GraphQL</h1>\n<h1>Queries and Mutations</h1>\n<p>On this page, you'll learn in detail about how to query a GraphQL server.</p>\n<h2>Fields<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fields\"></a></h2>\n<p>At its simplest, GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects. Let's start by looking at a very simple query and the result we get when we run it:</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>hero {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"hero\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"R2-D2\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>You can see immediately that the query has exactly the same shape as the result. This is essential to GraphQL, because you always get back what you expect, and the server knows exactly what fields the client is asking for.</p>\n<p>The field <code>name</code> returns a <code>String</code> type, in this case the name of the main hero of Star Wars, <code>\"R2-D2\"</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh, one more thing - the query above is <em>interactive</em>. That means you can change it as you like and see the new result. Try adding an <code>appearsIn</code> field to the <code>hero</code> object in the query, and see the new result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the previous example, we just asked for the name of our hero which returned a String, but fields can also refer to Objects. In that case, you can make a <em>sub-selection</em> of fields for that object. GraphQL queries can traverse related objects and their fields, letting clients fetch lots of related data in one request, instead of making several roundtrips as one would need in a classic REST architecture.</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>hero {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<h1>Queries can have comments!</h1>\n<p>friends {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"hero\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"R2-D2\",</p>\n<p>\"friends\": [</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Han Solo\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Leia Organa\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>Note that in this example, the <code>friends</code> field returns an array of items. GraphQL queries look the same for both single items or lists of items, however we know which one to expect based on what is indicated in the schema.</p>\n<h2>Arguments<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#arguments\"></a></h2>\n<p>If the only thing we could do was traverse objects and their fields, GraphQL would already be a very useful language for data fetching. But when you add the ability to pass arguments to fields, things get much more interesting.</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>human(id: \"1000\") {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>height</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"human\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\",</p>\n<p>\"height\": 1.72</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>In a system like REST, you can only pass a single set of arguments - the query parameters and URL segments in your request. But in GraphQL, every field and nested object can get its own set of arguments, making GraphQL a complete replacement for making multiple API fetches. You can even pass arguments into scalar fields, to implement data transformations once on the server, instead of on every client separately.</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>human(id: \"1000\") {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>height(unit: FOOT)</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"human\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\",</p>\n<p>\"height\": 5.6430448</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>Arguments can be of many different types. In the above example, we have used an Enumeration type, which represents one of a finite set of options (in this case, units of length, either <code>METER</code> or <code>FOOT</code>). GraphQL comes with a default set of types, but a GraphQL server can also declare its own custom types, as long as they can be serialized into your transport format.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/schema\">Read more about the GraphQL type system here.</a></p>\n<h2>Aliases<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases\"></a></h2>\n<p>If you have a sharp eye, you may have noticed that, since the result object fields match the name of the field in the query but don't include arguments, you can't directly query for the same field with different arguments. That's why you need <em>aliases</em> - they let you rename the result of a field to anything you want.</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>empireHero: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>jediHero: hero(episode: JEDI) {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"empireHero\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>\"jediHero\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"R2-D2\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>In the above example, the two <code>hero</code> fields would have conflicted, but since we can alias them to different names, we can get both results in one request.</p>\n<h2>Fragments<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments\"></a></h2>\n<p>Let's say we had a relatively complicated page in our app, which lets us look at two heroes side by side, along with their friends. You can imagine that such a query could quickly get complicated, because we would need to repeat the fields at least once - one for each side of the comparison.</p>\n<p>That's why GraphQL includes reusable units called <em>fragments</em>. Fragments let you construct sets of fields, and then include them in queries where you need to. Here's an example of how you could solve the above situation using fragments:</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>leftComparison: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {</p>\n<p>...comparisonFields</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>rightComparison: hero(episode: JEDI) {</p>\n<p>...comparisonFields</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>fragment comparisonFields on Character {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>appearsIn</p>\n<p>friends {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"leftComparison\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\",</p>\n<p>\"appearsIn\": [</p>\n<p>\"NEWHOPE\",</p>\n<p>\"EMPIRE\",</p>\n<p>\"JEDI\"</p>\n<p>],</p>\n<p>\"friends\": [</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Han Solo\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Leia Organa\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"C-3PO\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"R2-D2\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>\"rightComparison\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"R2-D2\",</p>\n<p>\"appearsIn\": [</p>\n<p>\"NEWHOPE\",</p>\n<p>\"EMPIRE\",</p>\n<p>\"JEDI\"</p>\n<p>],</p>\n<p>\"friends\": [</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Han Solo\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Leia Organa\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>You can see how the above query would be pretty repetitive if the fields were repeated. The concept of fragments is frequently used to split complicated application data requirements into smaller chunks, especially when you need to combine lots of UI components with different fragments into one initial data fetch.</p>\n<h3>Using variables inside fragments<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#using-variables-inside-fragments\"></a></h3>\n<p>It is possible for fragments to access variables declared in the query or mutation. See <a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables\">variables</a>.</p>\n<p>query HeroComparison($first: Int = 3) {</p>\n<p>leftComparison: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {</p>\n<p>...comparisonFields</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>rightComparison: hero(episode: JEDI) {</p>\n<p>...comparisonFields</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>fragment comparisonFields on Character {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>friendsConnection(first: $first) {</p>\n<p>totalCount</p>\n<p>edges {</p>\n<p>node {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>​</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"errors\": [</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"message\": \"Buffer is not defined\",</p>\n<p>\"locations\": [</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"line\": 12,</p>\n<p>\"column\": 3</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>],</p>\n<p>\"path\": [</p>\n<p>\"leftComparison\",</p>\n<p>\"friendsConnection\"</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"message\": \"Buffer is not defined\",</p>\n<p>\"locations\": [</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"line\": 12,</p>\n<p>\"column\": 3</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>],</p>\n<p>\"path\": [</p>\n<p>\"rightComparison\",</p>\n<p>\"friendsConnection\"</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>],</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"leftComparison\": null,</p>\n<p>\"rightComparison\": null</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<h2>Operation name<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#operation-name\"></a></h2>\n<p>Up until now, we have been using a shorthand syntax where we omit both the <code>query</code> keyword and the query name, but in production apps it's useful to use these to make our code less ambiguous.</p>\n<p>Here's an example that includes the keyword <code>query</code> as <em>operation type</em> and <code>HeroNameAndFriends</code> as <em>operation name</em> :</p>\n<p>query HeroNameAndFriends {</p>\n<p>hero {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>friends {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"hero\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"R2-D2\",</p>\n<p>\"friends\": [</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Han Solo\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Leia Organa\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>The <em>operation type</em> is either <em>query</em>, <em>mutation</em>, or <em>subscription</em> and describes what type of operation you're intending to do. The operation type is required unless you're using the query shorthand syntax, in which case you can't supply a name or variable definitions for your operation.</p>\n<p>The <em>operation name</em> is a meaningful and explicit name for your operation. It is only required in multi-operation documents, but its use is encouraged because it is very helpful for debugging and server-side logging. When something goes wrong (you see errors either in your network logs, or in the logs of your GraphQL server) it is easier to identify a query in your codebase by name instead of trying to decipher the contents. Think of this just like a function name in your favorite programming language. For example, in JavaScript we can easily work only with anonymous functions, but when we give a function a name, it's easier to track it down, debug our code, and log when it's called. In the same way, GraphQL query and mutation names, along with fragment names, can be a useful debugging tool on the server side to identify different GraphQL requests.</p>\n<h2>Variables<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables\"></a></h2>\n<p>So far, we have been writing all of our arguments inside the query string. But in most applications, the arguments to fields will be dynamic: For example, there might be a dropdown that lets you select which Star Wars episode you are interested in, or a search field, or a set of filters.</p>\n<p>It wouldn't be a good idea to pass these dynamic arguments directly in the query string, because then our client-side code would need to dynamically manipulate the query string at runtime, and serialize it into a GraphQL-specific format. Instead, GraphQL has a first-class way to factor dynamic values out of the query, and pass them as a separate dictionary. These values are called <em>variables</em>.</p>\n<p>When we start working with variables, we need to do three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Replace the static value in the query with <code>$variableName</code></li>\n<li>Declare <code>$variableName</code> as one of the variables accepted by the query</li>\n<li>Pass <code>variableName: value</code> in the separate, transport-specific (usually JSON) variables dictionary</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's what it looks like all together:</p>\n<p>query HeroNameAndFriends($episode: Episode) {</p>\n<p>hero(episode: $episode) {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>friends {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"episode\": \"JEDI\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"hero\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"R2-D2\",</p>\n<p>\"friends\": [</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Han Solo\"</p>\n<p>},</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"Leia Organa\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>]</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>Now, in our client code, we can simply pass a different variable rather than needing to construct an entirely new query. This is also in general a good practice for denoting which arguments in our query are expected to be dynamic - we should never be doing string interpolation to construct queries from user-supplied values.</p>\n<h3>Variable definitions<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variable-definitions\"></a></h3>\n<p>The variable definitions are the part that looks like <code>($episode: Episode)</code> in the query above. It works just like the argument definitions for a function in a typed language. It lists all of the variables, prefixed by <code>$</code>, followed by their type, in this case <code>Episode</code>.</p>\n<p>All declared variables must be either scalars, enums, or input object types. So if you want to pass a complex object into a field, you need to know what input type that matches on the server. Learn more about input object types on the Schema page.</p>\n<p>Variable definitions can be optional or required. In the case above, since there isn't an <code>!</code> next to the <code>Episode</code> type, it's optional. But if the field you are passing the variable into requires a non-null argument, then the variable has to be required as well.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the syntax for these variable definitions, it's useful to learn the GraphQL schema language. The schema language is explained in detail on the Schema page.</p>\n<h3>Default variables<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#default-variables\"></a></h3>\n<p>Default values can also be assigned to the variables in the query by adding the default value after the type declaration.</p>\n<p>query HeroNameAndFriends($episode: Episode = JEDI) {</p>\n<p>hero(episode: $episode) {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>friends {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>When default values are provided for all variables, you can call the query without passing any variables. If any variables are passed as part of the variables dictionary, they will override the defaults.</p>\n<h2>Directives<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives\"></a></h2>\n<p>We discussed above how variables enable us to avoid doing manual string interpolation to construct dynamic queries. Passing variables in arguments solves a pretty big class of these problems, but we might also need a way to dynamically change the structure and shape of our queries using variables. For example, we can imagine a UI component that has a summarized and detailed view, where one includes more fields than the other.</p>\n<p>Let's construct a query for such a component:</p>\n<p>query Hero($episode: Episode, $withFriends: Boolean!) {</p>\n<p>hero(episode: $episode) {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>friends @include(if: $withFriends) {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"episode\": \"JEDI\",</p>\n<p>\"withFriends\": false</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"hero\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"R2-D2\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>Try editing the variables above to instead pass <code>true</code> for <code>withFriends</code>, and see how the result changes.</p>\n<p>We needed to use a new feature in GraphQL called a <em>directive</em>. A directive can be attached to a field or fragment inclusion, and can affect execution of the query in any way the server desires. The core GraphQL specification includes exactly two directives, which must be supported by any spec-compliant GraphQL server implementation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>@include(if: Boolean)</code> Only include this field in the result if the argument is <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li><code>@skip(if: Boolean)</code> Skip this field if the argument is <code>true</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Directives can be useful to get out of situations where you otherwise would need to do string manipulation to add and remove fields in your query. Server implementations may also add experimental features by defining completely new directives.</p>\n<h2>Mutations<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations\"></a></h2>\n<p>Most discussions of GraphQL focus on data fetching, but any complete data platform needs a way to modify server-side data as well.</p>\n<p>In REST, any request might end up causing some side-effects on the server, but by convention it's suggested that one doesn't use <code>GET</code> requests to modify data. GraphQL is similar - technically any query could be implemented to cause a data write. However, it's useful to establish a convention that any operations that cause writes should be sent explicitly via a mutation.</p>\n<p>Just like in queries, if the mutation field returns an object type, you can ask for nested fields. This can be useful for fetching the new state of an object after an update. Let's look at a simple example mutation:</p>\n<p>mutation CreateReviewForEpisode($ep: Episode!, $review: ReviewInput!) {</p>\n<p>createReview(episode: $ep, review: $review) {</p>\n<p>stars</p>\n<p>commentary</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"ep\": \"JEDI\",</p>\n<p>\"review\": {</p>\n<p>\"stars\": 5,</p>\n<p>\"commentary\": \"This is a great movie!\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"createReview\": {</p>\n<p>\"stars\": 5,</p>\n<p>\"commentary\": \"This is a great movie!\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>Note how <code>createReview</code> field returns the <code>stars</code> and <code>commentary</code> fields of the newly created review. This is especially useful when mutating existing data, for example, when incrementing a field, since we can mutate and query the new value of the field with one request.</p>\n<p>You might also notice that, in this example, the <code>review</code> variable we passed in is not a scalar. It's an <em>input object type</em>, a special kind of object type that can be passed in as an argument. Learn more about input types on the Schema page.</p>\n<h3>Multiple fields in mutations<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#multiple-fields-in-mutations\"></a></h3>\n<p>A mutation can contain multiple fields, just like a query. There's one important distinction between queries and mutations, other than the name:</p>\n<p><strong>While query fields are executed in parallel, mutation fields run in series, one after the other.</strong></p>\n<p>This means that if we send two <code>incrementCredits</code> mutations in one request, the first is guaranteed to finish before the second begins, ensuring that we don't end up with a race condition with ourselves.</p>\n<h2>Inline Fragments<a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#inline-fragments\"></a></h2>\n<p>Like many other type systems, GraphQL schemas include the ability to define interfaces and union types. <a href=\"https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces\">Learn about them in the schema guide.</a></p>\n<p>If you are querying a field that returns an interface or a union type, you will need to use <em>inline fragments</em> to access data on the underlying concrete type. It's easiest to see with an example:</p>\n<p>query HeroForEpisode($ep: Episode!) {</p>\n<p>hero(episode: $ep) {</p>\n<p>name</p>\n<p>... on Droid {</p>\n<p>primaryFunction</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>... on Human {</p>\n<p>height</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"ep\": \"JEDI\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>{</p>\n<p>\"data\": {</p>\n<p>\"hero\": {</p>\n<p>\"name\": \"R2-D2\",</p>\n<p>\"primaryFunction\": \"Astromech\"</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>In this query, the <code>hero</code> field returns the type <code>Character</code>, which might be either a <code>Human</code> or a <code>Droid</code> depending on the <code>episode</code> argument. In the direct selection, you can only ask for fields that exist on the <code>Character</code> interface, such as <code>name</code>.</p>\n<p>To ask for a field on the concrete type, you need to use an <em>inline fragment</em> with a type condition. Because the first fragment is labeled as <code>... on Droid</code>, the <code>primaryFunction</code> field will only be executed if the <code>Character</code> returned from <code>hero</code> is of the <code>Droid</code> type.

The referrer will be the URL of the document whose window is this at the time of creation of the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest\">XMLHttpRequest</a> object.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API#example_of_pushstate_method\">Example of pushState() method</a></h3>\n<p>Suppose <a href=\"https://mozilla.org/foo.html\">https://mozilla.org/foo.html</a> executes the following JavaScript:</p>\n<p>This will cause the URL bar to display <a href=\"https://mozilla.org/bar.html\">https://mozilla.org/bar.html</a>, but won't cause the browser to load bar.html or even check that bar.html exists.</p>\n<p>Suppose now that the user navigates to <a href=\"https://google.com\">https://google.com</a>, then clicks the <strong>Back</strong> button. At this point, the URL bar will display <a href=\"https://mozilla.org/bar.html\">https://mozilla.org/bar.html</a> and history.state will contain the stateObj. The popstate event won't be fired because the page has been reloaded. The page itself will look like bar.html.</p>\n<p>If the user clicks <strong>Back</strong> once again, the URL will change to <a href=\"https://mozilla.org/foo.html\">https://mozilla.org/foo.html</a>, and the document will get a popstate event, this time with a null state object. Here too, going back doesn't change the document's contents from what they were in the previous step, although the document might update its contents manually upon receiving the popstate event.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API#the_pushstate_method\">The pushState() method</a></h3>\n<p>pushState() takes three parameters: a <strong>state object</strong>; a <strong>title</strong> (currently ignored); and (optionally), a <strong>URL</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let's examine each of these three parameters in more detail.</p>\n<p>The state object is a JavaScript object which is associated with the new history entry created by pushState(). Whenever the user navigates to the new state, a popstate event is fired, and the state property of the event contains a copy of the history entry's state object. The state object can be anything that can be serialized. Because Firefox saves state objects to the user's disk so they can be restored after the user restarts the browser, we impose a size limit of 640k characters on the serialized representation of a state object. If you pass a state object whose serialized representation is larger than this to pushState(), the method will throw an exception. If you need more space than this, you're encouraged to use sessionStorage and/or localStorage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2174\">All browsers but Safari currently ignore this parameter</a>, although they may use it in the future. Passing the empty string here should be safe against future changes to the method. Alternatively, you could pass a short title for the state to which you're moving.</p>\n<p>The new history entry's URL is given by this parameter. Note that the browser won't attempt to load this URL after a call to pushState(), but it might attempt to load the URL later, for instance after the user restarts the browser. The new URL does not need to be absolute; if it's relative, it's resolved relative to the current URL. The new URL must be of the same origin as the current URL; otherwise, pushState() will throw an exception. This parameter is optional; if it isn't specified, it's set to the document's current URL.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 / Thunderbird 3.3 / SeaMonkey 2.1) through Gecko 5.0 (Firefox 5.0 / Thunderbird 5.0 / SeaMonkey 2.2), the passed object is serialized using JSON. Starting in Gecko 6.0 (Firefox 6.0 / Thunderbird 6.0 / SeaMonkey 2.3), the object is serialized using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm\">the structured clone algorithm</a>. This allows a wider variety of objects to be safely passed.</p>\n<p>In a sense, calling pushState() is similar to setting window.location = \"#foo\", in that both will also create and activate another history entry associated with the current document.</p>\n<p>But pushState() has a few advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new URL can be any URL in the same origin as the current URL. In contrast, setting window.location keeps you at the same <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document\">document</a> only if you modify only the hash.</li>\n<li>You don't have to change the URL if you don't want to. In contrast, setting window.location = \"#foo\"; creates a new history entry only if the current hash isn't #foo.</li>\n<li>You can associate arbitrary data with your new history entry. With the hash-based approach, you need to encode all of the relevant data into a short string.</li>\n<li>If title is subsequently used by browsers, this data can be utilized (independent of, say, the hash).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that pushState() never causes a hashchange event to be fired, even if the new URL differs from the old URL only in its hash.</p>\n<p>In other documents, it creates an element with a null namespace URI.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API#the_replacestate_method\">The replaceState() method</a></h3>\n<p>history.replaceState() operates exactly like history.pushState(), except that replaceState() modifies the current history entry instead of creating a new one. Note that this doesn't prevent the creation of a new entry in the global browser history.</p>\n<p>replaceState() is particularly useful when you want to update the state object or URL of the current history entry in response to some user action.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 / Thunderbird 3.3 / SeaMonkey 2.1) through Gecko 5.0 (Firefox 5.0 / Thunderbird 5.0 / SeaMonkey 2.2), the passed object is serialized using JSON.

This allows a wider variety of objects to be safely passed.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API#example_of_replacestate_method\">Example of replaceState() method</a></h3>\n<p>Suppose <a href=\"https://mozilla.org/foo.html\">https://mozilla.org/foo.html</a> executes the following JavaScript:</p>\n<p>The explanation of these two lines above can be found at the above section <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API#example_of_pushstate_method\"><em>Example of pushState() method</em></a> section.</p>\n<p>Next, suppose <a href=\"https://mozilla.org/bar.html\">https://mozilla.org/bar.html</a> executes the following JavaScript:</p>\n<p>This will cause the URL bar to display <a href=\"https://mozilla.org/bar2.html\">https://mozilla.org/bar2.html</a>, but won't cause the browser to load bar2.html or even check that bar2.html exists.</p>\n<p>Suppose now that the user navigates to <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com\">https://www.microsoft.com</a>, then clicks the <strong>Back</strong> button. At this point, the URL bar will display <a href=\"https://mozilla.org/bar2.html\">https://mozilla.org/bar2.html</a>. If the user now clicks <strong>Back</strong> again, the URL bar will display <a href=\"https://mozilla.org/foo.html\">https://mozilla.org/foo.html</a>, and totally bypass bar.html.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API#the_popstate_event\">The popstate event</a></h3>\n<p>A popstate event is dispatched to the window every time the active history entry changes.

appendix is a non-exhaustive list of new syntactic features and methods that were added to JavaScript in ES6. These features are the most commonly used and most helpful.</p>\n<p>While this appendix doesn't cover ES6 classes, we go over the basics while learning about components in the book. In addition, this appendix doesn't include descriptions of some larger new features like promises and generators. If you'd like more info on those or on any topic below, we encourage you to reference the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla Developer Network's website</a> (MDN).</p>\n<h2>Prefer <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> over <code>var</code></h2>\n<p>If you've worked with ES5 JavaScript before, you're likely used to seeing variables declared with <code>var</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">ar myVariable = 5;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both the <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> statements also declare variables. They were introduced in ES6.</p>\n<p>Use <code>const</code> in cases where a variable is never re-assigned. Using <code>const</code> makes this clear to whoever is reading your code. It refers to the \"constant\" state of the variable in the context it is defined within.</p>\n<p>If the variable will be re-assigned, use <code>let</code>.</p>\n<p>We encourage the use of <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> instead of <code>var</code>. In addition to the restriction introduced by <code>const</code>, both <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> are <em>block scoped</em> as opposed to <em>function scoped</em>. This scoping can help avoid unexpected bugs.</p>\n<h2>Arrow functions</h2>\n<p>There are three ways to write arrow function bodies. For the examples below, let's say we have an array of city objects:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">onst cities = [\n  { name: 'Cairo', pop: 7764700 },\n  { name: 'Lagos', pop: 8029200 },\n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we write an arrow function that spans multiple lines, we must use braces to delimit the function body like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const formattedPopulations = cities.map((city) => {\n  const popMM = (city.pop / 1000000).toFixed(2);\n  return popMM + ' million';\n});\nconsole.log(formattedPopulations);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that we must also explicitly specify a <code>return</code> for the function.</p>\n<p>However, if we write a function body that is only a single line (or single expression) we can use parentheses to delimit it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const formattedPopulations2 = cities.map((city) => (\n  (city.pop / 1000000).toFixed(2) + ' million'\n));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notably, we don't use <code>return</code> as it's implied.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if your function body is terse you can write it like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const pops = cities.map(city => city.pop);\nconsole.log(pops);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The terseness of arrow functions is one of two reasons that we use them. Compare the one-liner above to this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const popsNoArrow = cities.map(function(city) { return city.pop });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of greater benefit, though, is how arrow functions bind the <code>this</code> object.</p>\n<p>The traditional JavaScript function declaration syntax (<code>function () {}</code>) will bind <code>this</code> in anonymous functions to the global object. To illustrate the confusion this causes, consider the following example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">unction printSong() {\n  console.log(\"Oops - The Global Object\");\n}\n\nconst jukebox = {\n  songs: [\n    {\n      title: \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\",\n      artist: \"Michael Jackson\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Superstar\",\n      artist: \"Madonna\",\n    },\n  ],\n  printSong: function (song) {\n    console.log(song.title + \" - \" + song.artist);\n  },\n  printSongs: function () {\n\n    this.songs.forEach(function(song) {\n\n      this.printSong(song);\n    });\n  },\n}\n\njukebox.printSongs();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The method <code>printSongs()</code> iterates over <code>this.songs</code> with <code>forEach()</code>. In this context, <code>this</code> is bound to the object (<code>jukebox</code>) as expected. However, the anonymous function passed to <code>forEach()</code> binds its internal <code>this</code> to the global object. As such, <code>this.printSong(song)</code> calls the function declared at the top of the example, <em>not</em> the method on <code>jukebox</code>.</p>\n<p>JavaScript developers have traditionally used workarounds for this behavior, but arrow functions solve the problem by <strong>capturing the <code>this</code> value of the enclosing context</strong>. Using an arrow function for <code>printSongs()</code> has the expected result:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">  printSongs: function () {\n    this.songs.forEach((song) => {\n\n      this.printSong(song);\n    });\n  },\n}\n\njukebox.printSongs();\n</code></pre>\n<p>For this reason, throughout the book we use arrow functions for all anonymous functions.</p>\n<h2>Modules</h2>\n<p>ES6 formally supports modules using the <code>import</code>/<code>export</code> syntax.</p>\n<p><strong>Named exports</strong></p>\n<p>Inside any file, you can use <code>export</code> to specify a variable the module should expose. Here's an example of a file that exports two functions:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">export const sayHi = () => (console.log('Hi!'));\nexport const sayBye = () => (console.log('Bye!'));\n\nconst saySomething = () => (console.log('Something!'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, anywhere we wanted to use these functions we could use <code>import</code>. We need to specify which functions we want to import. A common way of doing this is using ES6's destructuring assignment syntax to list them out like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">import { sayHi, sayBye } from './greetings';\n\nsayHi();\nsayBye();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Importantly, the function that was <em>not</em> exported (<code>saySomething</code>) is unavailable outside of the module.</p>\n<p>Also note that we supply a <strong>relative path</strong> to <code>from</code>, indicating that the ES6 module is a local file as opposed to an npm package.</p>\n<p>Instead of inserting an <code>export</code> before each variable you'd like to export, you can use this syntax to list off all the exposed variables in one area:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const sayHi = () => (console.log('Hi!'));\nconst sayBye = () => (console.log('Bye!'));\n\nconst saySomething = () => (console.log('Something!'));\n\nexport { sayHi, sayBye };\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can also specify that we'd like to import all of a module's functionality underneath a given namespace with the <code>import * as &#x3C;Namespace></code> syntax:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">import * as Greetings from './greetings';\n\nGreetings.sayHi();\n\nGreetings.sayBye();\n\nGreetings.saySomething();\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Default export</strong></p>\n<p>The other type of export is a default export. A module can only contain one default export:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const sayHi = () => (console.log('Hi!'));\nconst sayBye = () => (console.log('Bye!'));\n\nconst saySomething = () => (console.log('Something!'));\n\nconst Greetings = { sayHi, sayBye };\n\nexport default Greetings;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a common pattern for libraries. It means you can easily import the library wholesale without specifying what individual functions you want:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">import Greetings from './greetings';\n\nGreetings.sayHi();\nGreetings.sayBye();\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's not uncommon for a module to use a mix of both named exports and default exports. For instance, with <code>react-dom</code>, you can import <code>ReactDOM</code> (a default export) like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, if you're only going to use the <code>render()</code> function, you can import the named <code>render()</code> function like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">import { render } from 'react-dom';\n\nrender(\n\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>To achieve this flexibility, the export implementation for <code>react-dom</code> looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">export const render = (component, target) => {\n\n};\n\nconst ReactDOM = {\n  render,\n\n};\n\nexport default ReactDOM;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to play around with the module syntax, check out the folder <code>code/webpack/es6-modules</code>.</p>\n<p>For more reading on ES6 modules, see this article from Mozilla: \"<a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/\">ES6 in Depth: Modules</a>\".</p>\n<h2><code>Object.assign()</code></h2>\n<p>We use <code>Object.assign()</code> often throughout the book. We use it in areas where we want to create a modified version of an existing object.</p>\n<p><code>Object.assign()</code> accepts any number of objects as arguments. When the function receives two arguments, it <em>copies</em> the properties of the second object onto the first, like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">onst coffee = { };\nconst noCream = { cream: false };\nconst noMilk = { milk: false };\nObject.assign(coffee, noCream);\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is idiomatic to pass in three arguments to <code>Object.assign()</code>. The first argument is a new JavaScript object, the one that <code>Object.assign()</code> will ultimately return. The second is the object whose properties we'd like to build off of. The last is the changes we'd like to apply:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const coffeeWithMilk = Object.assign({}, coffee, { milk: true });\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Object.assign()</code> is a handy method for working with \"immutable\" JavaScript objects.</p>\n<h2>Template literals</h2>\n<p>In ES5 JavaScript, you'd interpolate variables into strings like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">var greeting = 'Hello, ' + user + '! It is ' + degF + ' degrees outside.';\n</code></pre>\n<p>With ES6 template literals, we can create the same string like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const greeting = `Hello, ${user}! It is ${degF} degrees outside.`;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>The spread operator (<code>...</code>)</h2>\n<p>In arrays, the ellipsis <code>...</code> operator will <em>expand</em> the array that follows into the parent array. The spread operator enables us to succinctly construct new arrays as a composite of existing arrays.</p>\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">onst a = [ 1, 2, 3 ];\nconst b = [ 4, 5, 6 ];\nconst c = [ ...a, ...b, 7, 8, 9 ];\n\nconsole.log(c);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how this is different than if we wrote:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const d = [ a, b, 7, 8, 9 ];\nconsole.log(d);\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Enhanced object literals</h2>\n<p>In ES5, all objects were required to have explicit key and value declarations:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const explicit = {\n  getState: getState,\n  dispatch: dispatch,\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In ES6, you can use this terser syntax whenever the property name and variable name are the same:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const implicit = {\n  getState,\n  dispatch,\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lots of open source libraries use this syntax, so it's good to be familiar with it. But whether you use it in your own code is a matter of stylistic preference.</p>\n<h2>Default arguments</h2>\n<p>With ES6, you can specify a default value for an argument in the case that it is <code>undefined</code> when the function is called.</p>\n<p>This:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">unction divide(a, b) {\n\n  const divisor = typeof b === 'undefined' ? 1 : b;\n\n  return a / divisor;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Can be written as this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">function divide(a, b = 1) {\n  return a / b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In both cases, using the function looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">divide(14, 2);\n\ndivide(14, undefined);\n\ndivide(14);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whenever the argument <code>b</code> in the example above is <code>undefined</code>, the default argument is used. Note that <code>null</code> will not use the default argument:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">divide(14, null);\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Destructuring assignments</h2>\n<h3>For arrays</h3>\n<p>In ES5, extracting and assigning multiple elements from an array looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">ar fruits = [ 'apples', 'bananas', 'oranges' ];\nvar fruit1 = fruits[0];\nvar fruit2 = fruits[1];\n</code></pre>\n<p>In ES6, we can use the destructuring syntax to accomplish the same task like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const [ veg1, veg2 ] = [ 'asparagus', 'broccoli', 'onion' ];\nconsole.log(veg1);\nconsole.log(veg2);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The variables in the array on the left are \"matched\" and assigned to the corresponding elements in the array on the right. Note that <code>'onion'</code> is ignored and has no variable bound to it.</p>\n<h3>For objects</h3>\n<p>We can do something similar for extracting object properties into variables:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const smoothie = {\n  fats: [ 'avocado', 'peanut butter', 'greek yogurt' ],\n  liquids: [ 'almond milk' ],\n  greens: [ 'spinach' ],\n  fruits: [ 'blueberry', 'banana' ],\n};\n\nconst { liquids, fruits } = smoothie;\n\nconsole.log(liquids);\nconsole.log(fruits);\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Parameter context matching</h3>\n<p>We can use these same principles to bind arguments inside a function to properties of an object supplied as an argument:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const containsSpinach = ({ greens }) => {\n  if (greens.find(g => g === 'spinach')) {\n    return true;\n  } else {\n    return false;\n  }\n};\n\ncontainsSpinach(smoothie);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We do this often with functional React components:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">const IngredientList = ({ ingredients, onClick }) => (\n  &#x3C;ul className='IngredientList'>\n    {\n      ingredients.map(i => (\n        &#x3C;li\n          key={i.id}\n          onClick={() => onClick(i.id)}\n          className='item'\n        >\n          {i.name}\n        &#x3C;/li>\n      ))\n    }\n  &#x3C;/ul>\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we use destructuring to extract the props into variables (<code>ingredients</code> and <code>onClick</code>) that we then use inside the component's function body.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/docs/art-of-command-line/","relativePath":"docs/docs/art-of-command-line.md","relativeDir":"docs/docs","base":"art-of-command-line.md","name":"art-of-command-line","frontmatter":{"title":"Command Line Basics","weight":0,"excerpt":"Learn basic Bash.

The goals are <em>breadth</em> (everything important), <em>specificity</em> (give concrete examples of the most common case), and <em>brevity</em> (avoid things that aren't essential or digressions you can easily look up elsewhere). Every tip is essential in some situation or significantly saves time over alternatives.</li>\n<li>This is written for Linux, with the exception of the \"<a href=\"#macos-only\">macOS only</a>\" and \"<a href=\"#windows-only\">Windows only</a>\" sections.

Actually, type <code>man bash</code> and at least skim the whole thing; it's pretty easy to follow and not that long. Alternate shells can be nice, but Bash is powerful and always available (learning <em>only</em> zsh, fish, etc., while tempting on your own laptop, restricts you in many situations, such as using existing servers).</li>\n<li>Learn at least one text-based editor well. The <code>nano</code> editor is one of the simplest for basic editing (opening, editing, saving, searching). However, for the power user in a text terminal, there is no substitute for Vim (<code>vi</code>), the hard-to-learn but venerable, fast, and full-featured editor. Many people also use the classic Emacs, particularly for larger editing tasks. (Of course, any modern software developer working on an extensive project is unlikely to use only a pure text-based editor and should also be familiar with modern graphical IDEs and tools.)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finding documentation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know how to read official documentation with <code>man</code> (for the inquisitive, <code>man man</code> lists the section numbers, e.g. 1 is \"regular\" commands, 5 is files/conventions, and 8 are for administration). Find man pages with <code>apropos</code>.</li>\n<li>Know that some commands are not executables, but Bash builtins, and that you can get help on them with <code>help</code> and <code>help -d</code>. You can find out whether a command is an executable, shell builtin or an alias by using <code>type command</code>.</li>\n<li><code>curl cheat.sh/command</code> will give a brief \"cheat sheet\" with common examples of how to use a shell command.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Learn about redirection of output and input using <code>></code> and <code>&#x3C;</code> and pipes using <code>|</code>. Know <code>></code> overwrites the output file and <code>>></code> appends. Learn about stdout and stderr.</li>\n<li>Learn about file glob expansion with <code>*</code> (and perhaps <code>?</code> and <code>[</code>...<code>]</code>) and quoting and the difference between double <code>\"</code> and single <code>'</code> quotes. (See more on variable expansion below.)</li>\n<li>Be familiar with Bash job management: <code>&#x26;</code>, <strong>ctrl-z</strong>, <strong>ctrl-c</strong>, <code>jobs</code>, <code>fg</code>, <code>bg</code>, <code>kill</code>, etc.</li>\n<li>Know <code>ssh</code>, and the basics of passwordless authentication, via <code>ssh-agent</code>, <code>ssh-add</code>, etc.</li>\n<li>Basic file management: <code>ls</code> and <code>ls -l</code> (in particular, learn what every column in <code>ls -l</code> means), <code>less</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code> and <code>tail -f</code> (or even better, <code>less +F</code>), <code>ln</code> and <code>ln -s</code> (learn the differences and advantages of hard versus soft links), <code>chown</code>, <code>chmod</code>, <code>du</code> (for a quick summary of disk usage: <code>du -hs *</code>). For filesystem management, <code>df</code>, <code>mount</code>, <code>fdisk</code>, <code>mkfs</code>, <code>lsblk</code>. Learn what an inode is (<code>ls -i</code> or <code>df -i</code>).</li>\n<li>Basic network management: <code>ip</code> or <code>ifconfig</code>, <code>dig</code>, <code>traceroute</code>, <code>route</code>.</li>\n<li>Learn and use a version control management system, such as <code>git</code>.</li>\n<li>Know regular expressions well, and the various flags to <code>grep</code>/<code>egrep</code>. The <code>-i</code>, <code>-o</code>, <code>-v</code>, <code>-A</code>, <code>-B</code>, and <code>-C</code> options are worth knowing.</li>\n<li>Learn to use <code>apt-get</code>, <code>yum</code>, <code>dnf</code> or <code>pacman</code> (depending on distro) to find and install packages. And make sure you have <code>pip</code> to install Python-based command-line tools (a few below are easiest to install via <code>pip</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Everyday use</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In Bash, use <strong>Tab</strong> to complete arguments or list all available commands and <strong>ctrl-r</strong> to search through command history (after pressing, type to search, press <strong>ctrl-r</strong> repeatedly to cycle through more matches, press <strong>Enter</strong> to execute the found command, or hit the right arrow to put the result in the current line to allow editing).</li>\n<li>In Bash, use <strong>ctrl-w</strong> to delete the last word, and <strong>ctrl-u</strong> to delete the content from current cursor back to the start of the line. Use <strong>alt-b</strong> and <strong>alt-f</strong> to move by word, <strong>ctrl-a</strong> to move cursor to beginning of line,  <strong>ctrl-e</strong> to move cursor to end of line, <strong>ctrl-k</strong> to kill to the end of the line, <strong>ctrl-l</strong> to clear the screen. See <code>man readline</code> for all the default keybindings in Bash. There are a lot. For example <strong>alt-.</strong> cycles through previous arguments, and <strong>alt-*</strong> expands a glob.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you love vi-style key-bindings, use <code>set -o vi</code> (and <code>set -o emacs</code> to put it back).</li>\n<li>For editing long commands, after setting your editor (for example <code>export EDITOR=vim</code>), <strong>ctrl-x</strong> <strong>ctrl-e</strong> will open the current command in an editor for multi-line editing. Or in vi style, <strong>escape-v</strong>.</li>\n<li>To see recent commands, use <code>history</code>. Follow with <code>!n</code> (where <code>n</code> is the command number) to execute again. There are also many abbreviations you can use, the most useful probably being <code>!$</code> for last argument and <code>!!</code> for last command (see \"HISTORY EXPANSION\" in the man page). However, these are often easily replaced with <strong>ctrl-r</strong> and <strong>alt-.</strong>.</li>\n<li>Go to your home directory with <code>cd</code>. Access files relative to your home directory with the <code>~</code> prefix (e.g. <code>~/.bashrc</code>). In <code>sh</code> scripts refer to the home directory as <code>$HOME</code>.</li>\n<li>To go back to the previous working directory: <code>cd -</code>.</li>\n<li>If you are halfway through typing a command but change your mind, hit <strong>alt-#</strong> to add a <code>#</code> at the beginning and enter it as a comment (or use <strong>ctrl-a</strong>, <strong>#</strong>, <strong>enter</strong>). You can then return to it later via command history.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use <code>xargs</code> (or <code>parallel</code>). It's very powerful. Note you can control how many items execute per line (<code>-L</code>) as well as parallelism (<code>-P</code>). If you're not sure if it'll do the right thing, use <code>xargs echo</code> first. Also, <code>-I{}</code> is handy. Examples:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">  find . -name '*.py' | xargs grep some_function\n  cat hosts | xargs -I{} ssh root@{} hostname\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><code>pstree -p</code> is a helpful display of the process tree.</li>\n<li>Use <code>pgrep</code> and <code>pkill</code> to find or signal processes by name (<code>-f</code> is helpful).</li>\n<li>Know the various signals you can send processes. For example, to suspend a process, use <code>kill -STOP [pid]</code>. For the full list, see <code>man 7 signal</code></li>\n<li>Use <code>nohup</code> or <code>disown</code> if you want a background process to keep running forever.</li>\n<li>Check what processes are listening via <code>netstat -lntp</code> or <code>ss -plat</code> (for TCP; add <code>-u</code> for UDP) or <code>lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P -n</code> (which also works on macOS).</li>\n<li>See also <code>lsof</code> and <code>fuser</code> for open sockets and files.</li>\n<li>See <code>uptime</code> or <code>w</code> to know how long the system has been running.</li>\n<li>Use <code>alias</code> to create shortcuts for commonly used commands. For example, <code>alias ll='ls -latr'</code> creates a new alias <code>ll</code>.</li>\n<li>Save aliases, shell settings, and functions you commonly use in <code>~/.bashrc</code>, and <a href=\"http://superuser.com/a/183980/7106\">arrange for login shells to source it</a>. This will make your setup available in all your shell sessions.</li>\n<li>Put the settings of environment variables as well as commands that should be executed when you login in <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. Separate configuration will be needed for shells you launch from graphical environment logins and <code>cron</code> jobs.</li>\n<li>Synchronize your configuration files (e.g. <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.bash_profile</code>) among various computers with Git.</li>\n<li>Understand that care is needed when variables and filenames include whitespace. Surround your Bash variables with quotes, e.g. <code>\"$FOO\"</code>. Prefer the <code>-0</code> or <code>-print0</code> options to enable null characters to delimit filenames, e.g. <code>locate -0 pattern | xargs -0 ls -al</code> or <code>find / -print0 -type d | xargs -0 ls -al</code>. To iterate on filenames containing whitespace in a for loop, set your IFS to be a newline only using <code>IFS=$'\\n'</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Bash scripts, use <code>set -x</code> (or the variant <code>set -v</code>, which logs raw input, including unexpanded variables and comments) for debugging output. Use strict modes unless you have a good reason not to: Use <code>set -e</code> to abort on errors (nonzero exit code). Use <code>set -u</code> to detect unset variable usages. Consider <code>set -o pipefail</code> too, to abort on errors within pipes (though read up on it more if you do, as this topic is a bit subtle). For more involved scripts, also use <code>trap</code> on EXIT or ERR. A useful habit is to start a script like this, which will make it detect and abort on common errors and print a message:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">  set -euo pipefail\n  trap \"echo 'error: Script failed: see failed command above'\" ERR\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Bash scripts, subshells (written with parentheses) are convenient ways to group commands. A common example is to temporarily move to a different working directory, e.g.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">  # do something in current dir\n  (cd /some/other/dir &#x26;&#x26; other-command)\n  # continue in original dir\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>In Bash, note there are lots of kinds of variable expansion. Checking a variable exists: <code>${name:?error message}</code>. For example, if a Bash script requires a single argument, just write <code>input_file=${1:?usage: $0 input_file}</code>. Using a default value if a variable is empty: <code>${name:-default}</code>. If you want to have an additional (optional) parameter added to the previous example, you can use something like <code>output_file=${2:-logfile}</code>. If <code>$2</code> is omitted and thus empty, <code>output_file</code> will be set to <code>logfile</code>. Arithmetic expansion: <code>i=$(( (i + 1) % 5 ))</code>. Sequences: <code>{1..10}</code>. Trimming of strings: <code>${var%suffix}</code> and <code>${var#prefix}</code>. For example if <code>var=foo.pdf</code>, then <code>echo ${var%.pdf}.txt</code> prints <code>foo.txt</code>.</li>\n<li>Brace expansion using <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> can reduce having to re-type similar text and automate combinations of items.  This is helpful in examples like <code>mv foo.{txt,pdf} some-dir</code> (which moves both files), <code>cp somefile{,.bak}</code> (which expands to <code>cp somefile somefile.bak</code>) or <code>mkdir -p test-{a,b,c}/subtest-{1,2,3}</code> (which expands all possible combinations and creates a directory tree). Brace expansion is performed before any other expansion.</li>\n<li>The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and filename expansion. (For example, a range like <code>{1..20}</code> cannot be expressed with variables using <code>{$a..$b}</code>. Use <code>seq</code> or a <code>for</code> loop instead, e.g., <code>seq $a $b</code> or <code>for((i=a; i&#x3C;=b; i++)); do ... ; done</code>.)</li>\n<li>\n<p>The output of a command can be treated like a file via <code>&#x3C;(some command)</code> (known as process substitution). For example, compare local <code>/etc/hosts</code> with a remote one:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">  diff /etc/hosts &#x3C;(ssh somehost cat /etc/hosts)\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When writing scripts you may want to put all of your code in curly braces. If the closing brace is missing, your script will be prevented from executing due to a syntax error. This makes sense when your script is going to be downloaded from the web, since it prevents partially downloaded scripts from executing:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">{\n  # Your code here\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A \"here document\" allows <a href=\"https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html\">redirection of multiple lines of input</a> as if from a file:</p>\n<pre><code>cat &#x3C;&#x3C;EOF\ninput\non multiple lines\nEOF\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>In Bash, redirect both standard output and standard error via: <code>some-command >logfile 2>&#x26;1</code> or <code>some-command &#x26;>logfile</code>. Often, to ensure a command does not leave an open file handle to standard input, tying it to the terminal you are in, it is also good practice to add <code>&#x3C;/dev/null</code>.</li>\n<li>Use <code>man ascii</code> for a good ASCII table, with hex and decimal values. For general encoding info, <code>man unicode</code>, <code>man utf-8</code>, and <code>man latin1</code> are helpful.</li>\n<li>Use <code>screen</code> or <a href=\"https://tmux.github.io/\"><code>tmux</code></a> to multiplex the screen, especially useful on remote ssh sessions and to detach and re-attach to a session. <code>byobu</code> can enhance screen or tmux by providing more information and easier management. A more minimal alternative for session persistence only is <a href=\"https://github.com/bogner/dtach\"><code>dtach</code></a>.</li>\n<li>In ssh, knowing how to port tunnel with <code>-L</code> or <code>-D</code> (and occasionally <code>-R</code>) is useful, e.g. to access web sites from a remote server.</li>\n<li>\n<p>It can be useful to make a few optimizations to your ssh configuration; for example, this <code>~/.ssh/config</code> contains settings to avoid dropped connections in certain network environments, uses compression (which is helpful with scp over low-bandwidth connections), and multiplex channels to the same server with a local control file:</p>\n<pre><code>  TCPKeepAlive=yes\n  ServerAliveInterval=15\n  ServerAliveCountMax=6\n  Compression=yes\n  ControlMaster auto\n  ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p\n  ControlPersist yes\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>A few other options relevant to ssh are security sensitive and should be enabled with care, e.g. per subnet or host or in trusted networks: <code>StrictHostKeyChecking=no</code>, <code>ForwardAgent=yes</code></li>\n<li>Consider <a href=\"https://mosh.mit.edu/\"><code>mosh</code></a> an alternative to ssh that uses UDP, avoiding dropped connections and adding convenience on the road (requires server-side setup).</li>\n<li>\n<p>To get the permissions on a file in octal form, which is useful for system configuration but not available in <code>ls</code> and easy to bungle, use something like</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">  stat -c '%A %a %n' /etc/timezone\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>For interactive selection of values from the output of another command, use <a href=\"https://github.com/mooz/percol\"><code>percol</code></a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/fzf\"><code>fzf</code></a>.</li>\n<li>For interaction with files based on the output of another command (like <code>git</code>), use <code>fpp</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker\">PathPicker</a>).</li>\n<li>For a simple web server for all files in the current directory (and subdirs), available to anyone on your network, use:\n<code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777</code> (for port 7777 and Python 2) and <code>python -m http.server 7777</code> (for port 7777 and Python 3).</li>\n<li>For running a command as another user, use <code>sudo</code>. Defaults to running as root; use <code>-u</code> to specify another user. Use <code>-i</code> to login as that user (you will be asked for <em>your</em> password).</li>\n<li>For switching the shell to another user, use <code>su username</code> or <code>su - username</code>. The latter with \"-\" gets an environment as if another user just logged in. Omitting the username defaults to root. You will be asked for the password <em>of the user you are switching to</em>.</li>\n<li>Know about the <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/CommonErrorMessages/ArgumentListTooLong\">128K limit</a> on command lines. This \"Argument list too long\" error is common when wildcard matching large numbers of files. (When this happens alternatives like <code>find</code> and <code>xargs</code> may help.)</li>\n<li>\n<p>For a basic calculator (and of course access to Python in general), use the <code>python</code> interpreter. For example,</p>\n<pre><code>>>> 2+3\n5\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Processing files and data</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To locate a file by name in the current directory, <code>find . -iname '*something*'</code> (or similar). To find a file anywhere by name, use <code>locate something</code> (but bear in mind <code>updatedb</code> may not have indexed recently created files).</li>\n<li>For general searching through source or data files, there are several options more advanced or faster than <code>grep -r</code>, including (in rough order from older to newer) <a href=\"https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack2\"><code>ack</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher\"><code>ag</code></a> (\"the silver searcher\"), and <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\"><code>rg</code></a> (ripgrep).</li>\n<li>To convert HTML to text: <code>lynx -dump -stdin</code></li>\n<li>For Markdown, HTML, and all kinds of document conversion, try <a href=\"http://pandoc.org/\"><code>pandoc</code></a>. For example, to convert a Markdown document to Word format: <code>pandoc README.md --from markdown --to docx -o temp.docx</code></li>\n<li>If you must handle XML, <code>xmlstarlet</code> is old but good.</li>\n<li>For JSON, use <a href=\"http://stedolan.github.io/jq/\"><code>jq</code></a>. For interactive use, also see <a href=\"https://github.com/simeji/jid\"><code>jid</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/fiatjaf/jiq\"><code>jiq</code></a>.</li>\n<li>For YAML, use <a href=\"https://github.com/0k/shyaml\"><code>shyaml</code></a>.</li>\n<li>For Excel or CSV files, <a href=\"https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit\">csvkit</a> provides <code>in2csv</code>, <code>csvcut</code>, <code>csvjoin</code>, <code>csvgrep</code>, etc.</li>\n<li>For Amazon S3, <a href=\"https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd\"><code>s3cmd</code></a> is convenient and <a href=\"https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd\"><code>s4cmd</code></a> is faster. Amazon's <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-cli\"><code>aws</code></a> and the improved <a href=\"https://github.com/donnemartin/saws\"><code>saws</code></a> are essential for other AWS-related tasks.</li>\n<li>Know about <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code>, including uniq's <code>-u</code> and <code>-d</code> options -- see one-liners below. See also <code>comm</code>.</li>\n<li>Know about <code>cut</code>, <code>paste</code>, and <code>join</code> to manipulate text files. Many people use <code>cut</code> but forget about <code>join</code>.</li>\n<li>Know about <code>wc</code> to count newlines (<code>-l</code>), characters (<code>-m</code>), words (<code>-w</code>) and bytes (<code>-c</code>).</li>\n<li>Know about <code>tee</code> to copy from stdin to a file and also to stdout, as in <code>ls -al | tee file.txt</code>.</li>\n<li>For more complex calculations, including grouping, reversing fields, and statistical calculations, consider <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/datamash/\"><code>datamash</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Know that locale affects a lot of command line tools in subtle ways, including sorting order (collation) and performance. Most Linux installations will set <code>LANG</code> or other locale variables to a local setting like US English. But be aware sorting will change if you change locale. And know i18n routines can make sort or other commands run <em>many times</em> slower. In some situations (such as the set operations or uniqueness operations below) you can safely ignore slow i18n routines entirely and use traditional byte-based sort order, using <code>export LC_ALL=C</code>.</li>\n<li>You can set a specific command's environment by prefixing its invocation with the environment variable settings, as in <code>TZ=Pacific/Fiji date</code>.</li>\n<li>Know basic <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code> for simple data munging. See <a href=\"#one-liners\">One-liners</a> for examples.</li>\n<li>\n<p>To replace all occurrences of a string in place, in one or more files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">  perl -pi.bak -e 's/old-string/new-string/g' my-files-*.txt\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To rename multiple files and/or search and replace within files, try <a href=\"https://github.com/jlevy/repren\"><code>repren</code></a>. (In some cases the <code>rename</code> command also allows multiple renames, but be careful as its functionality is not the same on all Linux distributions.)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">  # Full rename of filenames, directories, and contents foo -> bar:\n  repren --full --preserve-case --from foo --to bar .\n  # Recover backup files whatever.bak -> whatever:\n  repren --renames --from '(.*)\\.bak' --to '\\1' *.bak\n  # Same as above, using rename, if available:\n  rename 's/\\.bak$//' *.bak\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As the man page says, <code>rsync</code> really is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It's known for synchronizing between machines but is equally useful locally. When security restrictions allow, using <code>rsync</code> instead of <code>scp</code> allows recovery of a transfer without restarting from scratch. It also is among the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130929001850/http://linuxnote.net/jianingy/en/linux/a-fast-way-to-remove-huge-number-of-files.html\">fastest ways</a> to delete large numbers of files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">mkdir empty &#x26;&#x26; rsync -r --delete empty/ some-dir &#x26;&#x26; rmdir some-dir\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>For monitoring progress when processing files, use <a href=\"http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml\"><code>pv</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dmerejkowsky/pycp\"><code>pycp</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dspinellis/pmonitor\"><code>pmonitor</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Xfennec/progress\"><code>progress</code></a>, <code>rsync --progress</code>, or, for block-level copying, <code>dd status=progress</code>.</li>\n<li>Use <code>shuf</code> to shuffle or select random lines from a file.</li>\n<li>Know <code>sort</code>'s options. For numbers, use <code>-n</code>, or <code>-h</code> for handling human-readable numbers (e.g. from <code>du -h</code>). Know how keys work (<code>-t</code> and <code>-k</code>). In particular, watch out that you need to write <code>-k1,1</code> to sort by only the first field; <code>-k1</code> means sort according to the whole line. Stable sort (<code>sort -s</code>) can be useful. For example, to sort first by field 2, then secondarily by field 1, you can use <code>sort -k1,1 | sort -s -k2,2</code>.</li>\n<li>If you ever need to write a tab literal in a command line in Bash (e.g. for the -t argument to sort), press <strong>ctrl-v</strong> <strong>[Tab]</strong> or write <code>$'\\t'</code> (the latter is better as you can copy/paste it).</li>\n<li>The standard tools for patching source code are <code>diff</code> and <code>patch</code>. See also <code>diffstat</code> for summary statistics of a diff and <code>sdiff</code> for a side-by-side diff. Note <code>diff -r</code> works for entire directories. Use <code>diff -r tree1 tree2 | diffstat</code> for a summary of changes. Use <code>vimdiff</code> to compare and edit files.</li>\n<li>For binary files, use <code>hd</code>, <code>hexdump</code> or <code>xxd</code> for simple hex dumps and <code>bvi</code>, <code>hexedit</code> or <code>biew</code> for binary editing.</li>\n<li>Also for binary files, <code>strings</code> (plus <code>grep</code>, etc.) lets you find bits of text.</li>\n<li>For binary diffs (delta compression), use <code>xdelta3</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>To convert text encodings, try <code>iconv</code>. Or <code>uconv</code> for more advanced use; it supports some advanced Unicode things. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">  # Displays hex codes or actual names of characters (useful for debugging):\n  uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Hex;' &#x3C; input.txt\n  uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Name;' &#x3C; input.txt\n  # Lowercase and removes all accents (by expanding and dropping them):\n  uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Lower; ::Any-NFD; [:Nonspacing Mark:] >; ::Any-NFC;' &#x3C; input.txt > output.txt\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>To split files into pieces, see <code>split</code> (to split by size) and <code>csplit</code> (to split by a pattern).</li>\n<li>Date and time: To get the current date and time in the helpful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\">ISO 8601</a> format, use <code>date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"</code> (other options <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7216358/date-command-on-os-x-doesnt-have-iso-8601-i-option\">are</a> <a href=\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/164826/date-command-iso-8601-option\">problematic</a>). To manipulate date and time expressions, use <code>dateadd</code>, <code>datediff</code>, <code>strptime</code> etc. from <a href=\"http://www.fresse.org/dateutils/\"><code>dateutils</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Use <code>zless</code>, <code>zmore</code>, <code>zcat</code>, and <code>zgrep</code> to operate on compressed files.</li>\n<li>File attributes are settable via <code>chattr</code> and offer a lower-level alternative to file permissions. For example, to protect against accidental file deletion the immutable flag:  <code>sudo chattr +i /critical/directory/or/file</code></li>\n<li>\n<p>Use <code>getfacl</code> and <code>setfacl</code> to save and restore file permissions. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">getfacl -R /some/path > permissions.txt\nsetfacl --restore=permissions.txt\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>To create empty files quickly, use <code>truncate</code> (creates <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file\">sparse file</a>), <code>fallocate</code> (ext4, xfs, btrfs and ocfs2 filesystems), <code>xfs_mkfile</code> (almost any filesystems, comes in xfsprogs package), <code>mkfile</code> (for Unix-like systems like Solaris, Mac OS).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>System debugging</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>For web debugging, <code>curl</code> and <code>curl -I</code> are handy, or their <code>wget</code> equivalents, or the more modern <a href=\"https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie\"><code>httpie</code></a>.</li>\n<li>To know current cpu/disk status, the classic tools are <code>top</code> (or the better <code>htop</code>), <code>iostat</code>, and <code>iotop</code>. Use <code>iostat -mxz 15</code> for basic CPU and detailed per-partition disk stats and performance insight.</li>\n<li>For network connection details, use <code>netstat</code> and <code>ss</code>.</li>\n<li>For a quick overview of what's happening on a system, <code>dstat</code> is especially useful. For broadest overview with details, use <a href=\"https://github.com/nicolargo/glances\"><code>glances</code></a>.</li>\n<li>To know memory status, run and understand the output of <code>free</code> and <code>vmstat</code>. In particular, be aware the \"cached\" value is memory held by the Linux kernel as file cache, so effectively counts toward the \"free\" value.</li>\n<li>Java system debugging is a different kettle of fish, but a simple trick on Oracle's and some other JVMs is that you can run <code>kill -3 &#x3C;pid></code> and a full stack trace and heap summary (including generational garbage collection details, which can be highly informative) will be dumped to stderr/logs. The JDK's <code>jps</code>, <code>jstat</code>, <code>jstack</code>, <code>jmap</code> are useful. <a href=\"https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools\">SJK tools</a> are more advanced.</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/\"><code>mtr</code></a> as a better traceroute, to identify network issues.</li>\n<li>For looking at why a disk is full, <a href=\"https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu\"><code>ncdu</code></a> saves time over the usual commands like <code>du -sh *</code>.</li>\n<li>To find which socket or process is using bandwidth, try <a href=\"http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/iftop/\"><code>iftop</code></a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/raboof/nethogs\"><code>nethogs</code></a>.</li>\n<li>The <code>ab</code> tool (comes with Apache) is helpful for quick-and-dirty checking of web server performance.

These can be helpful if a program is failing, hanging, or crashing, and you don't know why, or if you want to get a general idea of performance. Note the profiling option (<code>-c</code>), and the ability to attach to a running process (<code>-p</code>). Use trace child option (<code>-f</code>) to avoid missing important calls.</li>\n<li>Know about <code>ldd</code> to check shared libraries etc — but <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/ldd-arbitrary-code-execution/\">never run it on untrusted files</a>.</li>\n<li>Know how to connect to a running process with <code>gdb</code> and get its stack traces.</li>\n<li>Use <code>/proc</code>. It's amazingly helpful sometimes when debugging live problems. Examples: <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>, <code>/proc/meminfo</code>, <code>/proc/cmdline</code>, <code>/proc/xxx/cwd</code>, <code>/proc/xxx/exe</code>, <code>/proc/xxx/fd/</code>, <code>/proc/xxx/smaps</code> (where <code>xxx</code> is the process id or pid).</li>\n<li>When debugging why something went wrong in the past, <a href=\"http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/\"><code>sar</code></a> can be very helpful.

Suppose <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are text files that are already uniqued. This is fast, and works on files of arbitrary size, up to many gigabytes. (Sort is not limited by memory, though you may need to use the <code>-T</code> option if <code>/tmp</code> is on a small root partition.)

You can often tell the difference by noting a man page has the heading \"BSD General Commands Manual.\" In some cases GNU versions can be installed, too (such as <code>gawk</code> and <code>gsed</code> for GNU awk and sed).

MSYS doesn't have all the features compared to Cygwin. MinGW is particularly useful for creating native Windows ports of Unix tools.</li>\n<li>Another option to get Unix look and feel under Windows is <a href=\"https://github.com/dthree/cash\">Cash</a>. Note that only very few Unix commands and command-line options are available in this environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Useful Windows command-line tools</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can perform and script most Windows system administration tasks from the command line by learning and using <code>wmic</code>.</li>\n<li>Native command-line Windows networking tools you may find useful include <code>ping</code>, <code>ipconfig</code>, <code>tracert</code>, and <code>netstat</code>.</li>\n<li>You can perform <a href=\"http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rundll32-shortcut-commands-windows\">many useful Windows tasks</a> by invoking the <code>Rundll32</code> command.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cygwin tips and tricks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Install additional Unix programs with the Cygwin's package manager.</li>\n<li>Use <code>mintty</code> as your command-line window.</li>\n<li>Access the Windows clipboard through <code>/dev/clipboard</code>.</li>\n<li>Run <code>cygstart</code> to open an arbitrary file through its registered application.</li>\n<li>Access the Windows registry with <code>regtool</code>.</li>\n<li>Note that a <code>C:\\</code> Windows drive path becomes <code>/cygdrive/c</code> under Cygwin, and that Cygwin's <code>/</code> appears under <code>C:\\cygwin</code> on Windows. Convert between Cygwin and Windows-style file paths with <code>cygpath</code>.

Arrays <a id=\"31ab\"></a></h2>\n<p>An <strong>array</strong> is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as <em>2-dimensional arrays</em>). Arrays are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pYIKtQYbX8vgCWrwe1YOyg.png?q=20\">Fig 1. Visualization of basic Terminology of Arrays (Image by author)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/473/1*pYIKtQYbX8vgCWrwe1YOyg.png\"></p>\n<h3>Array operations <a id=\"6504\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Traverse</strong>: Go through the elements and print them.</li>\n<li><strong>Search</strong>: Search for an element in the array. You can search the element by its value or its index</li>\n<li><strong>Update</strong>: Update the value of an existing element at a given index</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Inserting</strong> elements to an array and <strong>deleting</strong> elements from an array cannot be done straight away as arrays are fixed in size. If you want to insert an element to an array, first you will have to create a new array with increased size (current size + 1), copy the existing elements and add the new element. The same goes for the deletion with a new array of reduced size.</p>\n<h3><strong>Applications of arrays</strong> <a id=\"edcd\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Used as the building blocks to build other data structures such as array lists, heaps, hash tables, vectors and matrices.</li>\n<li>Used for different sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, quick sort, bubble sort and merge sort.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Linked Lists <a id=\"d965\"></a></h2>\n<p>A <strong>linked list</strong> is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other. Hence, you have to access data sequentially and random access is not possible. Linked lists provide a simple and flexible representation of dynamic sets.</p>\n<p>Let's consider the following terms regarding linked lists. You can get a clear idea by referring to Figure 2.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elements in a linked list are known as <strong>nodes</strong>.</li>\n<li>Each node contains a <strong>key</strong> and a pointer to its successor node, known as <strong>next</strong>.</li>\n<li>The attribute named <strong>head</strong> points to the first element of the linked list.</li>\n<li>The last element of the linked list is known as the <strong>tail</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*4fuF6lHXOSmoVNcOV8aaJA.png?q=20\">Fig 2. Visualization of basic Terminology of Linked Lists (Image by author)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/473/1*4fuF6lHXOSmoVNcOV8aaJA.png\"></p>\n<p>Following are the various types of linked lists available.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Singly linked list</strong> — Traversal of items can be done in the forward direction only.</li>\n<li><strong>Doubly linked list</strong> — Traversal of items can be done in both forward and backward directions. Nodes consist of an additional pointer known as <strong>prev</strong>, pointing to the previous node.</li>\n<li><strong>Circular linked lists</strong> — Linked lists where the prev pointer of the head points to the tail and the next pointer of the tail points to the head.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Linked list operations <a id=\"d683\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search</strong>: Find the first element with the key <strong>k</strong> in the given linked list by a simple linear search and returns a pointer to this element</li>\n<li><strong>Insert</strong>: Insert a key to the linked list. An insertion can be done in 3 different ways; insert at the beginning of the list, insert at the end of the list and insert in the middle of the list.</li>\n<li><strong>Delete</strong>: Removes an element <strong>x</strong> from a given linked list. You cannot delete a node by a single step. A deletion can be done in 3 different ways; delete from the beginning of the list, delete from the end of the list and delete from the middle of the list.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Applications of linked lists</strong> <a id=\"1da5\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Used for <em>symbol table management</em> in compiler design.</li>\n<li>Used in switching between programs using Alt + Tab (implemented using Circular Linked List).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Stacks <a id=\"ca20\"></a></h2>\n<p>A <strong>stack</strong> is a <strong>LIFO</strong> (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. This structure is named as “stack” because it resembles a real-world stack — a stack of plates.Image by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/congerdesign-509903/?utm_source=link-attribution&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=image&#x26;utm_content=629987\">congerdesign</a> from <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=image&#x26;utm_content=629987\">Pixabay</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/473/1*e4XWkyzxdOreblbPlbOCyw.jpeg\"></p>\n<h3>Stack operations <a id=\"4b54\"></a></h3>\n<p>Given below are the 2 basic operations that can be performed on a stack.

Queues <a id=\"0e94\"></a></h2>\n<p>A <strong>queue</strong> is a <strong>FIFO</strong> (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. This structure is named as “queue” because it resembles a real-world queue — people waiting in a queue.<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*GbtPRh9OWh1jtCtCa9czIg.jpeg?q=20\">Image by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/sheadquarters-5187/?utm_source=link-attribution&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=image&#x26;utm_content=50119\">Sabine Felidae</a> from <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=image&#x26;utm_content=50119\">Pixabay</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/473/1*GbtPRh9OWh1jtCtCa9czIg.jpeg\"></p>\n<h3>Queue operations <a id=\"9bcd\"></a></h3>\n<p>Given below are the 2 basic operations that can be performed on a queue.

Hash Tables <a id=\"4690\"></a></h2>\n<p>A <strong>Hash Table</strong> is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them. Furthermore, it supports lookup efficiently if we know the key associated with the value. Hence it is very efficient in inserting and searching, irrespective of the size of the data.</p>\n<p><strong>Direct Addressing</strong> uses the one-to-one mapping between the values and keys when storing in a table. However, there is a problem with this approach when there is a large number of key-value pairs. The table will be huge with so many records and may be impractical or even impossible to be stored, given the memory available on a typical computer. To avoid this issue we use <strong>hash tables</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Hash Function <a id=\"9052\"></a></h3>\n<p>A special function named as the <strong>hash function</strong> (<strong>h</strong>) is used to overcome the aforementioned problem in direct addressing.</p>\n<p>In direct accessing, a value with key <strong>k</strong> is stored in the slot <strong>k</strong>. Using the hash function, we calculate the index of the table (slot) to which each value goes. The value calculated using the hash function for a given key is called the <strong>hash value</strong> which indicates the index of the table to which the value is mapped.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>h(k) = k % m</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>h:</strong> Hash function</li>\n<li><strong>k:</strong> Key of which the hash value should be determined</li>\n<li><strong>m:</strong> Size of the hash table (number of slots available). A prime value that is not close to an exact power of 2 is a good choice for <strong>m</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*xOmBfzMxLLldy1ll4w7esg.png?q=20\">Fig 5. Representation of a Hash Function (Image by author)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/473/1*xOmBfzMxLLldy1ll4w7esg.png\"></p>\n<p>Consider the hash function <strong>h(k) = k % 20</strong>, where the size of the hash table is 20. Given a set of keys, we want to calculate the hash value of each to determine the index where it should go in the hash table. Consider we have the following keys, the hash and the hash table index.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 → 1%20 → 1</li>\n<li>5 → 5%20 → 5</li>\n<li>23 → 23%20 → 3</li>\n<li>63 → 63%20 → 3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the last two examples given above, we can see that <strong>collision</strong> can arise when the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. We can resolve collisions by selecting a suitable hash function h and use techniques such as <strong>chaining</strong> and <strong>open addressing</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Applications of hash tables <a id=\"0328\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Used to implement database indexes.</li>\n<li>Used to implement associative arrays.</li>\n<li>Used to implement the “set” data structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>6. Trees <a id=\"1c0f\"></a></h2>\n<p>A <strong>tree</strong> is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order.</p>\n<p>Various types of trees have been developed throughout the past decades, in order to suit certain applications and meet certain constraints. Some examples are binary search tree, B tree, treap, red-black tree, splay tree, AVL tree and n-ary tree.</p>\n<h3>Binary Search Trees <a id=\"ba6b\"></a></h3>\n<p>A <strong>binary search tree (BST)</strong>, as the name suggests, is a binary tree where data is organized in a hierarchical structure.

Heaps <a id=\"9e26\"></a></h2>\n<p>A <strong>Heap</strong> is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.</p>\n<p>Let us see how we can represent heaps. Heaps can be represented using trees as well as arrays. Figures 7 and 8 show how we can represent a binary heap using a binary tree and an array.<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*BEq4aj8K7u4LbIaIEtHNmQ.png?q=20\">Fig 7.

This is called the <strong>min-heap property</strong>. The root will contain the minimum value of the heap.</li>\n<li><strong>Max Heap</strong> — the key of the parent is greater than or equal to those of its children. This is called the <strong>max-heap property</strong>.

Graphs <a id=\"e0c7\"></a></h2>\n<p>A <strong>graph</strong> consists of a finite set of <strong>vertices</strong> or nodes and a set of <strong>edges</strong> connecting these vertices.</p>\n<p>The <strong>order</strong> of a graph is the number of vertices in the graph. The <strong>size</strong> of a graph is the number of edges in the graph.</p>\n<p>Two nodes are said to be <strong>adjacent</strong> if they are connected to each other by the same edge.</p>\n<h3>Directed Graphs <a id=\"3763\"></a></h3>\n<p>A graph <strong>G</strong> is said to be a <strong>directed graph</strong> if all its edges have a direction indicating what is the start vertex and what is the end vertex.</p>\n<p>We say that <strong>(u, v)</strong> is <strong>incident from</strong> or <strong>leaves</strong> vertex <strong>u</strong> and is <strong>incident to</strong> or <strong>enters</strong> vertex <strong>v</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Self-loops</strong>: Edges from a vertex to itself.</p>\n<h3>Undirected Graphs <a id=\"9fe9\"></a></h3>\n<p>A graph <strong>G</strong> is said to be an <strong>undirected graph</strong> if all its edges have no direction. It can go in both ways between the two vertices.</p>\n<p>If a vertex is not connected to any other node in the graph, it is said to be <strong>isolated</strong>.<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bgRmFfnYXHYXSv1pbNea0A.png?q=20\">Fig 9.

It is shorthand for four padding properties in this order: <code>padding-top</code>, <code>padding-right</code>, <code>padding-bottom</code>, <code>padding-left</code> (clockwise!)</p>\n<p><strong>Border</strong>- Border applies a border on all sides of an element.

They are syntactically similar to the related feature in C#, Java 8 and CoffeeScript.  They support both statement block bodies as well as expression bodies which return the value of the expression.  Unlike functions, arrows share the same lexical <code>this</code> as their surrounding code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// Expression bodies\nvar odds = evens.map(v => v + 1);\nvar nums = evens.map((v, i) => v + i);\nvar pairs = evens.map(v => ({even: v, odd: v + 1}));\n\n// Statement bodies\nnums.forEach(v => {\n  if (v % 5 === 0)\n    fives.push(v);\n});\n\n// Lexical this\nvar bob = {\n  _name: \"Bob\",\n  _friends: [],\n  printFriends() {\n    this._friends.forEach(f =>\n      console.log(this._name + \" knows \" + f));\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions\">MDN Arrow Functions</a></p>\n<h3>Classes</h3>\n<p>ES6 classes are a simple sugar over the prototype-based OO pattern.  Having a single convenient declarative form makes class patterns easier to use, and encourages interoperability.  Classes support prototype-based inheritance, super calls, instance and static methods and constructors.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">class SkinnedMesh extends THREE.Mesh {\n  constructor(geometry, materials) {\n    super(geometry, materials);\n\n    this.idMatrix = SkinnedMesh.defaultMatrix();\n    this.bones = [];\n    this.boneMatrices = [];\n    //...\n  }\n  update(camera) {\n    //...\n    super.update();\n  }\n  get boneCount() {\n    return this.bones.length;\n  }\n  set matrixType(matrixType) {\n    this.idMatrix = SkinnedMesh[matrixType]();\n  }\n  static defaultMatrix() {\n    return new THREE.Matrix4();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes\">MDN Classes</a></p>\n<h3>Enhanced Object Literals</h3>\n<p>Object literals are extended to support setting the prototype at construction, shorthand for <code>foo: foo</code> assignments, defining methods, making super calls, and computing property names with expressions.  Together, these also bring object literals and class declarations closer together, and let object-based design benefit from some of the same conveniences.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">var obj = {\n    // __proto__\n    __proto__: theProtoObj,\n    // Shorthand for 'handler: handler'\n    handler,\n    // Methods\n    toString() {\n     // Super calls\n     return \"d \" + super.toString();\n    },\n    // Computed (dynamic) property names\n    [ 'prop_' + (() => 42)() ]: 42\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#Object_literals\">MDN Grammar and types: Object literals</a></p>\n<h3>Template Strings</h3>\n<p>Template strings provide syntactic sugar for constructing strings.  This is similar to string interpolation features in Perl, Python and more.  Optionally, a tag can be added to allow the string construction to be customized, avoiding injection attacks or constructing higher level data structures from string contents.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// Basic literal string creation\n`In JavaScript '\\n' is a line-feed.`\n\n// Multiline strings\n`In JavaScript this is\n not legal.`\n\n// String interpolation\nvar name = \"Bob\", time = \"today\";\n`Hello ${name}, how are you ${time}?`\n\n// Construct an HTTP request prefix is used to interpret the replacements and construction\nPOST`http://foo.org/bar?a=${a}&#x26;b=${b}\n     Content-Type: application/json\n     X-Credentials: ${credentials}\n     { \"foo\": ${foo},\n       \"bar\": ${bar}}`(myOnReadyStateChangeHandler);\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/template_strings\">MDN Template Strings</a></p>\n<h3>Destructuring</h3>\n<p>Destructuring allows binding using pattern matching, with support for matching arrays and objects.  Destructuring is fail-soft, similar to standard object lookup <code>foo[\"bar\"]</code>, producing <code>undefined</code> values when not found.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// list matching\nvar [a, , b] = [1,2,3];\n\n// object matching\nvar { op: a, lhs: { op: b }, rhs: c }\n       = getASTNode()\n\n// object matching shorthand\n// binds `op`, `lhs` and `rhs` in scope\nvar {op, lhs, rhs} = getASTNode()\n\n// Can be used in parameter position\nfunction g({name: x}) {\n  console.log(x);\n}\ng({name: 5})\n\n// Fail-soft destructuring\nvar [a] = [];\na === undefined;\n\n// Fail-soft destructuring with defaults\nvar [a = 1] = [];\na === 1;\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment\">MDN Destructuring assignment</a></p>\n<h3>Default + Rest + Spread</h3>\n<p>Callee-evaluated default parameter values.  Turn an array into consecutive arguments in a function call.  Bind trailing parameters to an array.  Rest replaces the need for <code>arguments</code> and addresses common cases more directly.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">function f(x, y=12) {\n  // y is 12 if not passed (or passed as undefined)\n  return x + y;\n}\nf(3) == 15\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">function f(x, ...y) {\n  // y is an Array\n  return x * y.length;\n}\nf(3, \"hello\", true) == 6\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">function f(x, y, z) {\n  return x + y + z;\n}\n// Pass each elem of array as argument\nf(...[1,2,3]) == 6\n</code></pre>\n<p>More MDN info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters\">Default parameters</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters\">Rest parameters</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator\">Spread Operator</a></p>\n<h3>Let + Const</h3>\n<p>Block-scoped binding constructs.  <code>let</code> is the new <code>var</code>.  <code>const</code> is single-assignment.  Static restrictions prevent use before assignment.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">function f() {\n  {\n    let x;\n    {\n      // okay, block scoped name\n      const x = \"sneaky\";\n      // error, const\n      x = \"foo\";\n    }\n    // error, already declared in block\n    let x = \"inner\";\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>More MDN info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let\">let statement</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const\">const statement</a></p>\n<h3>Iterators + For..Of</h3>\n<p>Iterator objects enable custom iteration like CLR IEnumerable or Java Iterable.  Generalize <code>for..in</code> to custom iterator-based iteration with <code>for..of</code>.  Don't require realizing an array, enabling lazy design patterns like LINQ.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">let fibonacci = {\n  [Symbol.iterator]() {\n    let pre = 0, cur = 1;\n    return {\n      next() {\n        [pre, cur] = [cur, pre + cur];\n        return { done: false, value: cur }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfor (var n of fibonacci) {\n  // truncate the sequence at 1000\n  if (n > 1000)\n    break;\n  console.log(n);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Iteration is based on these duck-typed interfaces (using <a href=\"http://typescriptlang.org\">TypeScript</a> type syntax for exposition only):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-TypeScript\">interface IteratorResult {\n  done: boolean;\n  value: any;\n}\ninterface Iterator {\n  next(): IteratorResult;\n}\ninterface Iterable {\n  [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of\">MDN for...of</a></p>\n<h3>Generators</h3>\n<p>Generators simplify iterator-authoring using <code>function*</code> and <code>yield</code>.  A function declared as function* returns a Generator instance.  Generators are subtypes of iterators which include additional  <code>next</code> and <code>throw</code>.  These enable values to flow back into the generator, so <code>yield</code> is an expression form which returns a value (or throws).</p>\n<p>Note: Can also be used to enable 'await'-like async programming, see also ES7 <code>await</code> proposal.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">var fibonacci = {\n  [Symbol.iterator]: function*() {\n    var pre = 0, cur = 1;\n    for (;;) {\n      var temp = pre;\n      pre = cur;\n      cur += temp;\n      yield cur;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfor (var n of fibonacci) {\n  // truncate the sequence at 1000\n  if (n > 1000)\n    break;\n  console.log(n);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The generator interface is (using <a href=\"http://typescriptlang.org\">TypeScript</a> type syntax for exposition only):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-TypeScript\">interface Generator extends Iterator {\n    next(value?: any): IteratorResult;\n    throw(exception: any);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols\">MDN Iteration protocols</a></p>\n<h3>Unicode</h3>\n<p>Non-breaking additions to support full Unicode, including new Unicode literal form in strings and new RegExp <code>u</code> mode to handle code points, as well as new APIs to process strings at the 21bit code points level.  These additions support building global apps in JavaScript.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// same as ES5.1\n\"𠮷\".length == 2\n\n// new RegExp behaviour, opt-in 'u'\n\"𠮷\".match(/./u)[0].length == 2\n\n// new form\n\"\\u{20BB7}\"==\"𠮷\"==\"\\uD842\\uDFB7\"\n\n// new String ops\n\"𠮷\".codePointAt(0) == 0x20BB7\n\n// for-of iterates code points\nfor(var c of \"𠮷\") {\n  console.log(c);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>More info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/unicode\">MDN RegExp.prototype.unicode</a></p>\n<h3>Modules</h3>\n<p>Language-level support for modules for component definition.  Codifies patterns from popular JavaScript module loaders (AMD, CommonJS). Runtime behaviour defined by a host-defined default loader.  Implicitly async model – no code executes until requested modules are available and processed.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// lib/math.js\nexport function sum(x, y) {\n  return x + y;\n}\nexport var pi = 3.141593;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// app.js\nimport * as math from \"lib/math\";\nalert(\"2π = \" + math.sum(math.pi, math.pi));\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// otherApp.js\nimport {sum, pi} from \"lib/math\";\nalert(\"2π = \" + sum(pi, pi));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Some additional features include <code>export default</code> and <code>export *</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// lib/mathplusplus.js\nexport * from \"lib/math\";\nexport var e = 2.71828182846;\nexport default function(x) {\n    return Math.log(x);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// app.js\nimport ln, {pi, e} from \"lib/mathplusplus\";\nalert(\"2π = \" + ln(e)*pi*2);\n</code></pre>\n<p>More MDN info: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import\">import statement</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export\">export statement</a></p>\n<h3>Module Loaders</h3>\n<p>Module loaders support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic loading</li>\n<li>State isolation</li>\n<li>Global namespace isolation</li>\n<li>Compilation hooks</li>\n<li>Nested virtualization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The default module loader can be configured, and new loaders can be constructed to evaluate and load code in isolated or constrained contexts.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-JavaScript\">// Dynamic loading – 'System' is default loader\nSystem.import('lib/math').then(function(m) {\n  alert(\"2π = \" + m.sum(m.pi, m.pi));\n});\n\n// Create execution sandboxes – new Loaders\nvar loader = new Loader({\n  global: fixup(window) // replace 'console.log'\n});\nloader.eval(\"console.log('hello world!');\");\n\n// Directly manipulate module cache\nSystem.get('jquery');\nSystem.set('jquery', Module({$: $})); // WARNING: not yet finalized\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Map + Set + WeakMap + WeakSet</h3>\n<p>Efficient data structures for common algorithms.

Every change has a\nunique id.</li>\n<li>Distributed systems have no defined structure. You could easily have a SVN\nstyle, centralized system, with git.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control\">Additional Information</a></p>\n<h3>Why Use Git?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Can work offline.</li>\n<li>Collaborating with others is easy!</li>\n<li>Branching is easy!</li>\n<li>Branching is fast!</li>\n<li>Merging is easy!</li>\n<li>Git is fast.</li>\n<li>Git is flexible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Git Architecture</h2>\n<h3>Repository</h3>\n<p>A set of files, directories, historical records, commits, and heads. Imagine it\nas a source code data structure, with the attribute that each source code\n\"element\" gives you access to its revision history, among other things.</p>\n<p>A git repository is comprised of the .git directory &#x26; working tree.</p>\n<h3>.git Directory (component of repository)</h3>\n<p>The .git directory contains all the configurations, logs, branches, HEAD, and\nmore.\n<a href=\"http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/03/23/whats-inside-your-git-directory.html\">Detailed List.</a></p>\n<h3>Working Tree (component of repository)</h3>\n<p>This is basically the directories and files in your repository. It is often\nreferred to as your working directory.</p>\n<h3>Index (component of .git dir)</h3>\n<p>The Index is the staging area in git. It's basically a layer that separates\nyour working tree from the Git repository. This gives developers more power\nover what gets sent to the Git repository.</p>\n<h3>Commit</h3>\n<p>A git commit is a snapshot of a set of changes, or manipulations to your\nWorking Tree. For example, if you added 5 files, and removed 2 others, these\nchanges will be contained in a commit (or snapshot). This commit can then be\npushed to other repositories, or not!</p>\n<h3>Branch</h3>\n<p>A branch is essentially a pointer to the last commit you made. As you go on\ncommitting, this pointer will automatically update to point to the latest commit.</p>\n<h3>Tag</h3>\n<p>A tag is a mark on specific point in history. Typically people use this\nfunctionality to mark release points (v1.0, and so on).</p>\n<h3>HEAD and head (component of .git dir)</h3>\n<p>HEAD is a pointer that points to the current branch. A repository only has 1\n<em>active</em> HEAD.\nhead is a pointer that points to any commit. A repository can have any number\nof heads.</p>\n<h3>Stages of Git</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Modified - Changes have been made to a file but file has not been committed\nto Git Database yet</li>\n<li>Staged - Marks a modified file to go into your next commit snapshot</li>\n<li>Committed - Files have been committed to the Git Database</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conceptual Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/\">Git For Computer Scientists</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://hoth.entp.com/output/git_for_designers.html\">Git For Designers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Commands</h2>\n<h3>init</h3>\n<p>Create an empty Git repository. The Git repository's settings, stored\ninformation, and more is stored in a directory (a folder) named \".git\".</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ git init\n</code></pre>\n<h3>config</h3>\n<p>To configure settings.

These commands have been in Git all along.</p>\n<p>But <code>git checkout</code> has, in effect, two <em>modes of operation</em>. One mode is \"safe\": it won't accidentally destroy any unsaved work. The other mode is \"unsafe\": if you use it, and it tells Git to wipe out some unsaved file, Git assumes that (a) you knew it meant that and (b) you really did mean to wipe out your unsaved file, so Git immediately wipes out your unsaved file.</p>\n<p>This is not very friendly, so the Git folks finally---after years of users griping---split <code>git checkout</code> into two new commands. This leads us to:</p>\n<h3>From a historical perspective</h3>\n<p><code>git restore</code> is <em>new</em>, having first come into existence in August 2019, in Git 2.23. <code>git reset</code> is very old, having been in Git all along, dating back to before 2005. Both commands have the ability to destroy unsaved work.</p>\n<p>The <code>git switch</code> command is also new, introduced along with <code>git restore</code> in Git 2.23. It implements the \"safe half\" of <code>git checkout</code>; <code>git restore</code> implements the \"unsafe half\".</p>\n<h3>When would you use which command?</h3>\n<p>This is the most complicated part, and to really understand it, we need to know the following items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Git is really all about <em>commits</em>. Commits get stored <em>in</em> the Git repository. The <code>git push</code> and <code>git fetch</code> commands transfer <em>commits</em>---whole commits, as an all-or-nothing deal^1^---to the other Git. You either have all of a commit, or you don't have it. Other commands, such as <code>git merge</code> or <code>git rebase</code>, all work with <em>local</em> commits. The <code>pull</code> command runs <code>fetch</code> (to get commits) followed by a second command to work with the commits once they're local.</li>\n<li>New commits <em>add to the repository</em>. You almost never <em>remove</em> a commit <em>from</em> the repository. Only one of the five commands listed here---checkout, reset, restore, revert, and switch---is capable of removing commits.^2^</li>\n<li>Each commit is numbered by its <em>hash ID</em>, which is unique to that one particular commit. It's actually computed from what's <em>in</em> the commit, which is how Git makes these numbers work across all Gits eveywhere. This means that what is in the commit is frozen for all time: if you change anything, what you get is a new commit with a new number, and the old commit is still there, with its same old number.</li>\n<li>Each commit stores two things: a snapshot, and metadata. The metadata include the hash ID(s) of some previous commit(s). This makes commits form backwards-looking chains.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <em>branch name</em> holds the hash ID of one commit. This makes the branch name <em>find</em> that commit, which in turn means two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that particular commit is the <em>tip commit</em> of that branch; and</li>\n<li>all commits leading up to and including that tip commit are <em>on</em> that branch.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We're also going to talk about Git's <em>index</em> in a moment, and your <em>working tree</em>. They're separate from these but worth mentioning early, especially since the index has three names: Git sometimes calls it the <em>index</em>, sometimes calls it the <em>staging area</em>, and sometimes---rarely these days---calls it the <em>cache</em>. All three names refer to the same thing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everything up through the <em>branch name</em> is, I think, best understood via pictures (at least for most people). If we draw a series of commits, with newer commits towards the right, using <code>o</code> for each commit and omitting some commits for space or whatever, we get something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>        o--o---o   &#x3C;-- feature-top\n       /\\\no--o--o--o--...--o---o--o   &#x3C;-- main\n    \\               /\n     o--o--...--o--o   &#x3C;-- feature-hull\n</code></pre>\n<p>which, as you can see, is a boat repository. 😀 There are three branches. The mainline branch holds <em>every commit</em>, including all the commits on the top row and bottom (hull) row. The <code>feature-top</code> branch holds the top three commits and also the three commits along the main line to the left, but not any of the commits on the bottom row. All the connectors <em>between</em> commits are---well, <em>should be</em> but I don't have a good enough font---one-way arrows, pointing left, or down-and-left, or up-and-left.</p>\n<p>These \"arrows\", or one way connections from commit to commit, are technically <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/a/31208\"><em>arcs</em>, or one-way edges</a>, in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph\"><em>directed graph</em></a>. This directed graph is one without cycles, making it a Directed Acyclic Graph or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph\">DAG</a>, which has a bunch of properties that are useful to Git.</p>\n<p>If you're just using Git to store files inside commits, all you really care about are the round <code>o</code> <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1441525\"><em>nodes</em> or <em>vertices</em> (again two words for the same thing)</a>, each of which acts to store your files, but you should at least be vaguely aware of how they are arranged. It matters, especially because of <em>merges</em>. Merge commits are those with two outgoing arcs, pointing backwards to two of what Git calls <em>parent commits</em>. The child commit is the one \"later\": just as human parents are always older than their children, Git parent commits are older than their children.</p>\n<p>We need one more thing, though: <strong>Where do new commits come from?</strong> We noted that what's in a commit---both the snapshot, holding all the files, and the metadata, holding the rest of the information Git keeps about a commit---is all read-only. Your files are not only frozen, they're also <em>transformed</em>, and the transformed data are then <em>de-duplicated</em>, so that even though every commit has a full snapshot of <em>every</em> file, the repository itself stays relatively slim. But this means that the files <em>in</em> a commit can only be <em>read</em> by Git, and <em>nothing</em>---not even Git itself---can <em>write</em> to them. They get saved once, and are de-duplicated from then on. The commits act as archives, almost like tar or rar or winzip or whatever.</p>\n<p>To work with a Git repository, then, we have to have Git <em>extract</em> the files. This takes the files <em>out</em> of some commit, turning those special archive-formatted things into regular, usable files. Note that Git may well be able to store files that your computer literally <em>can't</em> store: a classic example is a file named <code>aux.h</code>, for some C program, on a Windows machine. We won't go into all the details, but it is theoretically possible to still get work done with this repository, which was probably built on a Linux system, even if you're on a Windows system where you can't work with the <code>aux.h</code> file directly.</p>\n<p>Anyway, assuming there are no nasty little surprises like <code>aux.h</code>, you would just run <code>git checkout</code> or <code>git switch</code> to get some commit <em>out</em> of Git. This will fill in your <em>working tree</em>, populating it from the files stored in the <em>tip commit</em> of some branch. The <em>tip commit</em> is, again, the <em>last</em> commit on that branch, as found by the <em>branch name</em>. Your <code>git checkout</code> or <code>git switch</code> selected that commit to be the <em>current commit</em>, by selecting that branch name to be the <em>current branch</em>. You now have all the files <em>from</em> that commit, in an area where you can see them and work on them: your <em>working tree</em>.</p>\n<p>Note that the files in your working tree <em>are not actually in Git itself</em>. They were just <em>extracted from</em> Git. This matters a lot, because when <code>git checkout</code> extracts the files <em>from</em> Git, it actually puts each file in two places. One of those places is the ordinary everyday file you see and work on / with. The other place Git puts each file is into Git's <em>index</em>.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned a moment ago, the index has three names: index, staging area, and cache. All refer to the same thing: the place Git sticks these \"copies\" of each file. Each one is actually pre-de-duplicated, so the word \"copy\" is slightly wrong, but---unlike much of the rest of its innards---Git actually does a really good job of hiding the de-duplication aspect. Unless you start getting into internal commands like <code>git ls-files</code> and <code>git update-index</code>, you don't need to know about this part, and can just think of the index as holding a copy of the file, ready to go into the <em>next commit</em>.</p>\n<p>What this all means for you as someone just <em>using</em> Git is that the index / staging-area acts as your <em>proposed next commit</em>. When you run <code>git commit</code>, Git is going to package up <em>these</em> copies of the file as the ones to be archived in the snapshot. The copies you have in your working tree are <em>yours;</em> the <em>index / staging-area</em> copies are <em>Git's</em>, ready to go. So, if you <em>change</em> your copies and want the <em>changed</em> copy to be what goes in the next snapshot, you must tell Git: <em>Update the Git copy, in the Git index / staging-area.</em> You do this with <code>git add</code>.^3^ The <code>git add</code> command means <em>make the proposed-next-commit copy match the working-tree copy</em>. It's the <code>add</code> command that does the updating: this is when Git compresses and de-duplicates the file and makes it ready for archiving, not at <code>git commit</code> time.^4^</p>\n<p>Then, assuming you have some series of commits ending with the one with <em><code>hash-N</code>:</em></p>\n<pre><code>[hash1] &#x3C;-[hash2] ... &#x3C;-[hashN]   &#x3C;--branch\n</code></pre>\n<p>you run <code>git commit</code>, give it any metadata it needs (a commit log message), and you get an N+1'th commit:</p>\n<pre><code>[hash1] &#x3C;-[hash2] ... &#x3C;-[hashN] &#x3C;-[hashN+1]   &#x3C;--branch\n</code></pre>\n<p>Git automatically updates the <em>branch name</em> to point to the <em>new commit</em>, which has therefore been <em>added to the branch</em>.</p>\n<p>Let's look at each of the various commands now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>git checkout</code>: this is a large and complicated command.</p>\n<p>We already saw this one, or at least, <em>half</em> of this one. We used it to pick out a branch name, and therefore a particular commit. This kind of checkout first looks at our current commit, index, and working tree. It makes sure that we have committed all our modified files, or---this part gets a bit complicated---that if we <em>haven't</em> committed all our modified files, switching to that other branch is \"safe\". If it's <em>not</em> safe, <code>git checkout</code> tells you that you can't switch due to having modified files. If it <em>is</em> safe, <code>git checkout</code> will switch; if you didn't mean to switch, you can just switch back. (See also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/22053757/1256452\">Checkout another branch when there are uncommitted changes on the current branch</a>)</p>\n<p>But <code>git checkout</code> has an <em>unsafe</em> half. Suppose you have modified some file in your working tree, such as <code>README.md</code> or <code>aux.h</code> or whatever. You now look back at what you changed and think: <em>No, that's a bad idea. I should get rid of this change. I'd like the file back exactly as it was before.</em></p>\n<p>To get this---to <em>wipe out</em> your changes to, say, <code>README.md</code>---you can run:</p>\n<pre><code>git checkout -- README.md\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>--</code> part here is optional. It's a good idea to use it, because it tells Git that the part that comes after <code>--</code> is a <em>file name</em>, not a <em>branch name</em>.</p>\n<p>Suppose you have a <em>branch</em> named <code>hello</code> <em>and</em> a <em>file</em> named <code>hello</code>. What does:</p>\n<pre><code>git checkout hello\n</code></pre>\n<p>mean? Are we asking Git to clobber the <em>file</em> <code>hello</code> to remove the changes we made, or are we asking Git to check out the <em>branch</em> <code>hello</code>? To make this unambiguous, you have to write either:</p>\n<pre><code>git checkout -- hello        (clobber the file)\n</code></pre>\n<p>or:</p>\n<pre><code>git checkout hello --        (get the branch)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This case, where there are branches and files or directories with the same name, is a particularly insidious one. It has bitten real users. It's <em>why</em> <code>git switch</code> exists now. The <code>git switch</code> command <em>never means clobber my files</em>. It only means <em>do the safe kind of <code>git checkout</code>.</em></p>\n<p>(The <code>git checkout</code> command has been smartened up too, so that if you have the new commands and you run the \"bad\" kind of ambiguous <code>git checkout</code>, Git will just complain at you and do nothing at all. Either use the smarter split-up commands, or add the <code>--</code> at the right place to pick which kind of operation you want.)</p>\n<p>More precisely, <em>this kind</em> of <code>git checkout</code>, ideally spelled <code>git checkout -- *paths*</code>, is a request for Git to copy files from Git's index to your working tree. This means <em>clobber my files</em>. You can also run <code>git checkout *tree-ish* -- *paths*</code>, where you add a commit hash ID^5^ to the command. This tells Git to copy the files from that commit, first to Git's index, and then on to your working tree. This, too, means <em>clobber my files:</em> the difference is where Git gets the copies of the files it's extracting.</p>\n<p>If you ran <code>git add</code> on some file and thus copied it into Git's index, you need <code>git checkout HEAD -- *file*</code> to get it back from the current commit. The copy that's in Git's <em>index</em> is the one you <code>git add</code>-ed. So these two forms of <code>git checkout</code>, with a commit hash ID (or the name <code>HEAD</code>), the optional <code>--</code>, and the file name, are the unsafe <em>clobber my files</em> forms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>git reset</code>: this is also a large and complicated command.</p>\n<p>There are, depending on how you count, up to about five or six different forms of <code>git reset</code>. We'll concentrate on a smaller subset here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>git reset [ --hard | --mixed | --soft ] [ *commit* ]</code></p>\n<p>Here, we're asking Git to do several things. First, if we give a <em><code>commit</code></em> argument, such as <code>HEAD</code> or <code>HEAD~3</code> or some such, we've picked a particular <em>commit</em> that Git should <em>reset to</em>. This is the kind of command that will <em>remove commits</em> by ejecting them off the end of the branch. Of all the commands listed here, this is the only one that removes any commits. One other command---<code>git commit --amend</code>---has the effect of ejecting the <em>last</em> commit while putting on a new replacement, but that one is limited to ejecting <em>one</em> commit.</p>\n<p>Let's show this as a drawing. Suppose we have:</p>\n<pre><code>...--E--F--G--H   &#x3C;-- branch\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is, this branch, named <code>branch</code>, ends with four commits whose hash IDs we'll call <code>E</code>, <code>F</code>, <code>G</code>, and <code>H</code> in that order. The name <code>branch</code> currently stores the hash ID of the last of these commits, <code>H</code>. If we use <code>git reset --hard HEAD~3</code>, we're telling Git to eject the <em>last three commits</em>. The result is:</p>\n<pre><code>       F--G--H   ???\n      /\n...--E   &#x3C;-- branch\n</code></pre>\n<p>The name <code>branch</code> now selects commit <code>E</code>, not commit <code>H</code>. If we did not write down (on paper, on a whiteboard, in a file) the hash IDs of the last three commits, they've just become somewhat hard to find. Git does gives a way to find them again, for a while, but mostly they just seem to be <em>gone</em>.</p>\n<p>The <code>HEAD~3</code> part of this command is how we chose to drop the last three commits. It's part of a whole sub-topic in Git, documented in <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrevisions\">the gitrevisions manual</a>, on ways to name specific commits. The reset command just needs the hash ID of an actual commit, or anything equivalent, and <code>HEAD~3</code> means <em>go back three first-parent steps</em>, which in this case gets us from commit <code>H</code> back to commit <code>E</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>--hard</code> part of the <code>git reset</code> is how we tell Git what to do with (a) its index and (b) our working tree files. We have three choices here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>--soft</code> tells Git: <em>leave both alone</em>. Git will move the <em>branch name</em> without touching the index or our working tree. If you run <code>git commit</code> now, whatever is (still) in the index is what goes into the <em>new</em> commit. If the index matches the snapshot in commit <code>H</code>, this gets you a new commit whose <em>snapshot</em> is <code>H</code>, but whose <em>parent</em> is <code>E</code>, as if commits <code>F</code> through <code>H</code> had all been collapsed into a single new commit. People usually call this <em>squashing</em>.</li>\n<li><code>--mixed</code> tells Git: <em>reset your index, but leave my working tree alone</em>. Git will move the branch name, then <em>replace every file that is in the index with the one from the newly selected commit</em>. But Git will leave all your <em>working tree</em> files alone. This means that as far as Git is concerned, you can start <code>git add</code>ing files to make a new commit. Your new commit won't match <code>H</code> unless you <code>git add</code> <em>everything</em>, so this means you could, for instance, build a new intermediate commit, sort of like <code>E+F</code> or something, if you wanted.</li>\n<li><code>--hard</code> tells Git: *reset your index <strong>and</strong> my working tree.* Git will move the branch name, replace all the files in its index, and replace all the files in your working tree, all as one big thing. It's now as if you never made those three commits at all. You no longer have the files from <code>F</code>, or <code>G</code>, or <code>H</code>: you have the files from commit <code>E</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that if you leave out the <em><code>commit</code></em> part of this kind of (hard/soft/mixed) <code>reset</code>, Git will use <code>HEAD</code>. Since <code>HEAD</code> names the <em>current commit</em> (as selected by the current branch name), this leaves the branch name itself unchanged: it still selects the same commit as before. So this is only useful with <code>--mixed</code> or <code>--hard</code>, because <code>git reset --soft</code>, with no commit hash ID, means <em>don't move the branch name, don't change Git's index, and don't touch my working tree</em>. Those are the three things this kind of <code>git reset</code> can do---move the branch name, change what's in Git's index, and change what's in your working tree---and you just ruled all three out. Git is OK with doing nothing, but why bother?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>git reset [ *tree-ish* ] -- *path*</code></p>\n<p>This is the other kind of <code>git reset</code> we'll care about here. It's a bit like a mixed reset, in that it means <em>clobber some of the index copies of files</em>, but here you specify <em>which files to clobber</em>. It's also a bit <em>unlike</em> a mixed reset, because this kind of <code>git reset</code> will never move the branch name.</p>\n<p>Instead, you pick which files you want copied from somewhere. The <em>somewhere</em> is the <em><code>tree-ish</code></em> you give; if you don't give one, the <em>somewhere</em> is <code>HEAD</code>, i.e., the current commit. This can only restore files in the <em>proposed next commit</em> to the form they have in <em>some existing commit</em>. By defaulting to the <em>current</em> existing commit, this kind of <code>git reset -- *path*</code> has the effect of undoing a <code>git add -- *path*</code>.^6^</p>\n<p>There are several other forms of <code>git reset</code>. To see what they all mean, consult <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset\">the documentation</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>git restore</code>: this got split off from <code>git checkout</code>.</p>\n<p>Basically, this does the same thing as the various forms of <code>git checkout</code> and <code>git reset</code> that clobber files (in your working tree and/or in Git's index). It's <em>smarter</em> than the old <code>git checkout</code>-and-clobber-my-work variant, in that you get to choose where the files come from <em>and</em> where they go, all in the one command line.</p>\n<p>To do what you used to do with <code>git checkout -- *file*</code>, you just run <code>git restore --staged --worktree -- *file*</code>. (You can leave out the <code>--</code> part, as with <code>git checkout</code>, in most cases, but it's just generally wise to get in the habit of using it. Like <code>git add</code>, this command is designed such that only files named <code>-whatever</code> are actually problematic.)</p>\n<p>To do what you used to do with <code>git reset -- *file*</code>, you just run <code>git restore --staged -- *file*</code>. That is, you tell <code>git restore</code> to copy from <code>HEAD</code> to staging area / index, which is how <code>git reset</code> operates.</p>\n<p>Note that you can copy a file from some existing commit, to Git's index, without touching your working tree copy of that file: <code>git restore --source *commit* --staged -- *file*</code> does that. You can't do that at all with the old <code>git checkout</code> but you <em>can</em> do that with the old <code>git reset</code>, as <code>git reset *commit* -- *file*</code>. And, you can copy a file from some existing commit, to your working tree, without touching the staged copy: <code>git restore --source *commit* --worktree -- *file*</code> does that. The overlapping part (restore and reset) exists <em>because</em> <code>git restore</code> is new, and this kind of restore makes sense; probably, ideally, we should always use <code>git restore</code> here, instead of using the old <code>git reset</code> way of doing things, but Git tries to maintain backwards compatibility.</p>\n<p>The new ability---to copy from any arbitrary source, to your working tree, without touching Git's index / staging-area copy---is just that: new. You couldn't do it before. (You could run <code>git show *commit*:*path* > *path*</code>, before, but that falls outside our five commands to examine.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><code>git switch</code>: this just does the \"safe half\" of <code>git checkout</code>. That's really all you need to know. Using <code>git switch</code>, without <code>--force</code>, Git won't overwrite your unsaved work, even if you make a typo or whatever. The old <code>git checkout</code> command could overwrite unsaved work: if your typo turns a branch name into a file name, for instance, well, oops.</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>git revert</code> (I added this for completeness): this makes a <em>new commit</em>. The point of the new commit is to <em>back out</em> what someone did in some existing commit. You therefore need to name the existing commit that revert should back out. This command probably should have been named <code>git backout</code>.</p>\n<p>If you back out the most recent commit, this does revert to the second-most-recent snapshot:</p>\n<pre><code>  ...--G--H   &#x3C;-- branch\n</code></pre>\n<p>becomes:</p>\n<pre><code>  ...--G--H--Ħ   &#x3C;-- branch\n</code></pre>\n<p>where commit <code>Ħ</code> (H-bar) \"undoes\" commit <code>H</code> and therefore leaves us with the same <em>files</em> as commit <code>G</code>. But we don't have to undo the <em>most recent</em> commit. We could take:</p>\n<pre><code>  ...--E--F--G--H   &#x3C;-- branch\n</code></pre>\n<p>and add a commit <code>Ǝ</code> that undoes <code>E</code> to get:</p>\n<pre><code>  ...--E--F--G--H--Ǝ   &#x3C;-- branch\n</code></pre>\n<p>which may not match the source snapshot of any previous commit!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Further Information</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a

In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the</em> <code>exec()</code> <em>and</em> <code>test()</code> <em>methods of</em> <code>RegExp</code><em>, and with the</em> <code>match()</code><em>,</em> <code>matchAll()</code><em>,</em> <code>replace()</code><em>,</em> <code>replaceAll()</code><em>,</em> <code>search()</code><em>, and</em> <code>split()</code> <em>methods of</em> <code>String</code><em>. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.</em></p>\n<h3>Creating a regular expression</h3>\n<p>You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"8a7f\"><strong>Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>let re = /ab+c/;</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"f4e2\">Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. Or calling the constructor function of the</strong> <code>RegExp</code> <strong>object, as follows:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"2016\"><code>let re = new RegExp('ab+c');</code></span></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression</em>. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Writing a regular expression pattern</h3>\n<p>A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as <code>/abc/</code>, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as <code>/ab*c/</code> or <code>/Chapter (\\d+)\\.\\d*/</code>.</p>\n<p>The last example includes <strong>parentheses, which are used as a memory device</strong>. <em>The match made with this part of the pattern is remembered for later use.</em></p>\n<h3>Using simple patterns</h3>\n<p>Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match.</p>\n<p>For example, the pattern <code>/abc/</code> matches character combinations in strings only when the exact sequence <code>\"abc\"</code> occurs (all characters together and in that order).</p>\n<p>Such a match would succeed in the strings <code>\"Hi, do you know your abc's?\"</code> and <code>\"The latest airplane designs evolved from slabcraft.\"</code></p>\n<p>In both cases the match is with the substring <code>\"abc\"</code>.</p>\n<p>There is no match in the string <code>\"Grab crab\"</code> because while it contains the substring <code>\"ab c\"</code>, it does not contain the exact substring <code>\"abc\"</code>.</p>\n<h3>Using special characters</h3>\n<p>When the search for a match requires something more than a direct match, such as finding one or more b's, or finding white space, you can include special characters in the pattern.</p>\n<p>For example, to match <em>a single</em> <code>\"a\"</code> <em>followed by zero or more</em> <code>\"b\"</code><em>s followed by</em> <code>\"c\"</code>, you'd use the pattern <code>/ab*c/</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the <code>*</code> after <code>\"b\"</code> means \"0 or more occurrences of the preceding item.\" In the string <code>\"cbbabbbbcdebc\"</code>, this pattern will match the substring <code>\"abbbbc\"</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Regular_Expressions/Assertions.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\"><strong>Assertions</strong></a>** : Assertions include boundaries, which indicate the beginnings and endings of lines and words, and other patterns indicating in some way that a match is possible (including look-ahead, look-behind, and conditional expressions).**</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\"><strong>Character classes</strong></a>** : Distinguish different types of characters.

// $&#x26; means the whole matched string\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The \"g\" after the regular expression is an option or flag that performs a global search, looking in the whole string and returning all matches.</strong></p>\n<h3>Using parentheses</h3>\n<p>Parentheses around any part of the regular expression pattern causes that part of the matched substring to be remembered.</p>\n<p>Once remembered, the substring can be recalled for other use.</p>\n<h3>Using regular expressions in JavaScript</h3>\n<p>Regular expressions are used with the <code>RegExp</code> <strong>methods</strong></p>\n<p><code>test()</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>exec()</code></p>\n<p>and with the <code>String</code> <strong>methods</strong> <code>match()</code><strong>,</strong> <code>replace()</code><strong>,</strong> <code>search()</code><strong>, and</strong> <code>split()</code><strong>.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Method Descriptions</h3>\n<h4><code>exec()</code></h4>\n<p>Executes a search for a match in a string.</p>\n<p>It returns an array of information or <code>null</code> on a mismatch.</p>\n<h4><code>test()</code></h4>\n<p>Tests for a match in a string.</p>\n<p>It returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>\n<h4><code>match()</code></h4>\n<p>Returns an array containing all of the matches, including capturing groups, or <code>null</code> if no match is found.</p>\n<h4><code>matchAll()</code></h4>\n<p>Returns an iterator containing all of the matches, including capturing groups.</p>\n<h4><code>search()</code></h4>\n<p>Tests for a match in a string.</p>\n<p>It returns the index of the match, or <code>-1</code> if the search fails.</p>\n<h4><code>replace()</code></h4>\n<p>Executes a search for a match in a string, and replaces the matched substring with a replacement substring.</p>\n<h4><code>replaceAll()</code></h4>\n<p>Executes a search for all matches in a string, and replaces the matched substrings with a replacement substring.</p>\n<h4><code>split()</code></h4>\n<p>Uses a regular expression or a fixed string to break a string into an array of substrings.</p>\n<h3>Methods that use regular expressions</h3>\n<p>When you want to know whether a pattern is found in a string, use the <code>test()</code> or <code>search()</code> methods;</p>\n<p>for more information (but slower execution) use the <code>exec()</code> or <code>match()</code> methods.</p>\n<p>If you use <code>exec()</code> or <code>match()</code> and if the match succeeds, these methods return an array and update properties of the associated regular expression object and also of the predefined regular expression object, <code>RegExp</code>.</p>\n<p>If the <strong>match fails, the</strong> <code>exec()</code> <strong>method returns</strong> <code>null</code> (which coerces to <code>false</code>).</p>\n<p>In the following example, the script uses the <code>exec()</code> method to find a match in a string.</p>\n<pre><code>let myRe = /d(b+)d/g;\nlet myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you do not need to access the properties of the regular expression, an alternative way of creating <code>myArray</code> is with this script:</p>\n<pre><code>let myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz');\n    // similar to \"cdbbdbsbz\".match(/d(b+)d/g); however,\n    // \"cdbbdbsbz\".match(/d(b+)d/g) outputs Array [ \"dbbd\" ], while\n    // /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz') outputs Array [ 'dbbd', 'bb', index: 1, input: 'cdbbdbsbz' ].\n</code></pre>\n<p>(See <a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz/Cheat-Sheets/blob/master/Regular_Expressions.md#g-different-behaviors\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">different behaviors</a> for further info about the different behaviors.)</p>\n<p>If you want to construct the regular expression from a string, yet another alternative is this script:</p>\n<pre><code>let myRe = new RegExp('d(b+)d', 'g');\nlet myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');\n</code></pre>\n<p>With these scripts, the match succeeds and returns the array and updates the properties shown in the following table.</p>\n<p>Results of regular expression execution.</p>\n<p>You can use a regular expression created with an object initializer without assigning it to a letiable.</p>\n<p>If you do, however, every occurrence is a new regular expression.</p>\n<p>For this reason, if you use this form without assigning it to a letiable, you cannot subsequently access the properties of that regular expression.</p>\n<p>For example, assume you have this script:</p>\n<pre><code>let myRe = /d(b+)d/g;\nlet myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');\nconsole.log('The value of lastIndex is ' + myRe.lastIndex);\n\n// \"The value of lastIndex is 5\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, if you have this script:</p>\n<pre><code>let myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz');\nconsole.log('The value of lastIndex is ' + /d(b+)d/g.lastIndex);\n\n// \"The value of lastIndex is 0\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>The occurrences of <code>/d(b+)d/g</code> in the two statements are different regular expression objects and hence have different values for their <code>lastIndex</code> property.</p>\n<p>If you need to access the properties of a regular expression created with an object initializer, you should first assign it to a variable.</p>\n<h3>[Advanced searching with flags]</h3>\n<p>Regular expressions have <strong>six optional flags</strong> that allow for functionality like global and case insensitive searching.</p>\n<p>These flags can be used separately or together in any order, and are included as part of the regular expression.</p>\n<p>Flag Description Corresponding property</p>\n<hr>\n<p><code>g</code> Global search. <code>RegExp.prototype.global</code></p>\n<p><code>i</code> Case-insensitive search. <code>RegExp.prototype.ignoreCase</code></p>\n<p><code>m</code> Multi-line search. <code>RegExp.prototype.multiline</code></p>\n<p><code>s</code> Allows <code>.</code> to match newline characters. <code>RegExp.prototype.dotAll</code></p>\n<p><code>u</code> \"unicode\"; treat a pattern as a sequence of unicode code points. <code>RegExp.prototype.unicode</code></p>\n<p><code>y</code> Perform a \"sticky\" search that matches starting at the current position in the target string. <code>RegExp.prototype.sticky</code></p>\n<h4>Regular expression flags</h4>\n<p><em>To include a flag with the regular expression, use this syntax:</em></p>\n<pre><code>let re = /pattern/flags;\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code>let re = new RegExp('pattern', 'flags');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the flags are an integral part of a regular expression. They cannot be added or removed later.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>re = /\\w+\\s/g</code> creates a regular expression that looks for one or more characters followed by a space, and it looks for this combination throughout the string.</p>\n<pre><code>let re = /\\w+\\s/g;\nlet str = 'fee fi fo fum';\nlet myArray = str.match(re);\nconsole.log(myArray);\n\n// [\"fee \", \"fi \", \"fo \"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could replace the line:</p>\n<pre><code>let re = /\\w+\\s/g;\n</code></pre>\n<p>with:</p>\n<pre><code>let re = new RegExp('\\\\w+\\\\s', 'g');\n</code></pre>\n<p>and get the same result.</p>\n<p>The behavior associated with the <code>g</code> flag is different when the <code>.exec()</code> method is used.</p>\n<p>The roles of \"class\" and \"argument\" get reversed:</p>\n<p>In the case of <code>.match()</code>, the string class (or data type) owns the method and the regular expression is just an argument,</p>\n<p>while in the case of <code>.exec()</code>, it is the regular expression that owns the method, with the string being the argument.</p>\n<p>Contrast this <code>str.match(re)</code> versus <code>re.exec(str)</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>g</code> flag is used with the <code>.exec()</code> method to get iterative progression.</p>\n<pre><code>let xArray; while(xArray = re.exec(str)) console.log(xArray);\n// produces:\n// [\"fee \", index: 0, input: \"fee fi fo fum\"]\n// [\"fi \", index: 4, input: \"fee fi fo fum\"]\n// [\"fo \", index: 7, input: \"fee fi fo fum\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>m</code> flag is used to specify that a multiline input string should be treated as multiple lines.</p>\n<p>If the <code>m</code> flag is used, <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> match at the start or end of any line within the input string instead of the start or end of the entire string.</p>\n<h3>Using special characters to verify input</h3>\n<p>In the following example, the user is expected to enter a phone number. When the user presses the \"Check\" button, the script checks the validity of the number. If the number is valid (matches the character sequence specified by the regular expression), the script shows a message thanking the user and confirming the number.

src=\"https://visualize-callstack-qdvyu8oyc-visualize42.vercel.app/\" height=\"900px\" width=\"100%\">\n</iframe>\n<h6>About the Call Stack</h6>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> *The <strong>Call Stack</strong> tracks function calls. It is a LIFO stack of frames. Each frame represents a function call.*</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The <strong>Call Stack</strong> is a fundamental part of the JavaScript language. It is a record-keeping structure that allows us to perform function calls. Each function call is represented as a frame on the <strong>Call Stack</strong>. This is how the JavaScript engine keeps track of which functions have been called and in what order. The JS engine uses this information to ensure execution picks back up in the right spot after a function returns.</p>\n<p>When a JavaScript program first starts executing, the <strong>Call Stack</strong> is empty. When the first function call is made, a new frame is pushed onto the top of the <strong>Call Stack</strong>. When that function returns, its frame is popped off of the <strong>Call Stack</strong>.</p>\n<h6>About the Event Loop</h6>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> *The <strong>Event Loop</strong> processes Tasks and Microtasks. It places them into the Call Stack for execution one at a time. It also controls when rerendering occurs.*</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Event Loop is a looping algorithm that processes the Tasks/Microtasks in the Task Queue and Microtask Queue. It handles selecting the next Task/Microtask to be run and placing it in the Call Stack for execution.</p>\n<p>The Event Loop algorithm consists of four key steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Evaluate Script:</strong> Synchronously execute the script as though it were a function body. Run until the Call Stack is empty.</li>\n<li><strong>Run a Task:</strong> Select the oldest Task from the Task Queue. Run it until the Call Stack is empty.</li>\n<li><strong>Run all Microtasks:</strong> Select the oldest Microtask from the Microtask Queue. Run it until the Call Stack is empty. Repeat until the Microtask Queue is empty.</li>\n<li><strong>Rerender the UI:</strong> Rerender the UI. Then, return to step 2. (This step only applies to browsers, not NodeJS).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's model the Event Loop with some JavaScript psuedocode:</p>\n<pre><code>while (EventLoop.waitForTask()) {\n  const taskQueue = EventLoop.selectTaskQueue();\n  if (taskQueue.hasNextTask()) {\n    taskQueue.processNextTask();\n  }\n\n  const microtaskQueue = EventLoop.microTaskQueue;\n  while (microtaskQueue.hasNextMicrotask()) {\n    microtaskQueue.processNextMicrotask();\n  }\n\n  rerender();\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"url":"/docs/interact/clock/","relativePath":"docs/interact/clock.md","relativeDir":"docs/interact","base":"clock.md","name":"clock","frontmatter":{"title":"Clock","weight":0,"excerpt":"feel free to try the examples","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<center>\n<h2 style=\" margin-bottom: 2em;

These contacts will be displayed as a list of available users to whom you can send messages or make calls. Optionally, you can also manually provide a list of phone numbers of contacts who are using mesibo in <code>MESIBO_LOCAL_CONTACTS</code> or by clicking on the <code>Add Contact</code> button.</p>\n<p>You can provide a list of local contacts that will be loaded as a list of available users. Set local contacts as follows in <code>config.js</code></p>\n<pre><code>var MESIBO_LOCAL_CONTACTS =[\n\n{\n        \"address\" : \"18885551001\",\n        \"groupid\" : 0,\n        \"picture\" : \"images/profile/default-profile-icon.jpg\",\n        \"name\"    : \"MesiboTest\",\n        \"status\": \"Let's Chat..\"\n},\n\n{\n        \"groupid\" : 104661,\n        \"picture\" : \"images/profile/default-group-icon.jpg\",\n        \"name\"    : \"Mesibo Group\",\n        \"members\" : \"1:123,456,789\"             //Members list. Add 1: to mark as admin\n},\n\n]\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Popup</h2>\n<p>To launch popup demo you can configure the following for setting the displayed user avatar and destination user(to which all messages will be sent) in <code>config.js</code> and launch <code>popup.html</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const POPUP_DISPLAY_NAME = 'xxxx';\nconst POPUP_DISPLAY_PICTURE = 'images/profile/default-profile-icon.jpg';\nconst POPUP_DESTINATION_USER = 'xxxx';\n</code></pre>\n<h2>FAQ &#x26; Troubleshooting</h2>\n<h3>Getting <code>AUTHFAIL</code> with getcontacts API</h3>\n<p>This means the token you have provided in <code>MESIBO_ACCESS_TOKEN</code> is not generated or validated with your phone number which is required for synchronizing contacts.</p>\n<p>To generate a token by validating your phone number, make sure you have set <code>isLoginEnabled = true</code>. A login screen will then appear during app start, where you can enter your phone number(Example +91XXXXXXXXXX), get an OTP, and log in.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to synchronize contacts, set <code>isContactSync = false</code> and provide a list of local contacts in <code>MESIBO_LOCAL_CONTACTS</code>.</p>\n<h3>I do not wish to use phone login, what should I do?</h3>\n<p>Set <code>isLoginEnabled = false</code> and make sure that you provide a valid <code>MESIBO_ACCESS_TOKEN</code></p>\n<h3>I do not want to synchronize with my phone contacts, how do I configure that?</h3>\n<p>If you do not wish to synchronize contacts, set <code>isContactSync = false</code> and provide a list of local contacts in <code>MESIBO_LOCAL_CONTACTS</code>.</p>\n<h3>Do I need to log in with my phone number every time I load the app?</h3>\n<p>No the first time you log in with your phone number with a valid OTP the token will be stored in localStorage. In future loading of the app, the token will be loaded from local storage. Or if you have provided a valid <code>MESIBO_ACCESS_TOKEN</code> in <code>config.js</code> that will be loaded.</p>\n<h3>Getting $scope.mesibo.X is not a function</h3>\n<p>Ensure that you perform a hard reload so that you have the latest Mesibo Javascript API</p>\n<h2>Install Mesibo Javascript SDK</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to install Mesibo Javascript SDK is to include following in <code>&#x3C;HEAD></code> section of your HTML file:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://api.mesibo.com/mesibo.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also use <code>async</code> and <code>defer</code> attributes inside <code>script</code> tag if requires.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you may also use DOM method to load the mesibo JS on demand when it is not possible to use the script tag.</p>\n<pre><code>const script = document.createElement(\"script\");\nscript.src = \"https://api.mesibo.com/mesibo.js\";\ndocument.body.appendChild(script);\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You must use a secure website (https) to use mesibo javascript. It may NOT work from <code>http://</code> or <code>file://</code> sites due to browser security restrictions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Notes when using it for Calls and Conferencing</h2>\n<p>Due to the browser security model, camera and microphone access require the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You MUST use a secure URL (<code>https://</code>). The <code>http://</code> or <code>file://</code> URLs will NOT work.</li>\n<li>You MUST also use a valid certificate with recognized authority, the self-signed certificate will NOT work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The browser will not grant the camera and microphone permissions unless your app meets the above requirements. If permissions are not granted, calls and conferencing will not work.</p>\n<p>These restrictions are by the browsers and NOT by the mesibo. Refer Security section in the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#security\">Mozilla documentation</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3>That's All!</h3>\n<p>You can now begin developing features with mesibo.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mesibo.com/documentation/glossary/?term=javascript%20chat%20sdk\">javascript chat sdk</a>, <a

Every time you need a function you have to type out the dreaded <code>function () {}</code>. More concise function syntax was one of the many reasons why <a href=\"http://coffeescript.org/\">CoffeeScript</a> gained so much momentum back in the day. This is especially pronounced in the case of tiny callback functions. Lets look at a Promise chain:</p>\n<pre><code>function getVerifiedToken(selector) {\n  return getUsers(selector)\n    .then(function (users) { return users[0]; })\n    .then(verifyUser)\n    .then(function (user, verifiedToken) { return verifiedToken; })\n    .catch(function (err) { log(err.stack); });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Above is more or less plausible piece of code written using classical JavaScript <code>function</code> syntax. Here is what the same code could look like rewritten using the arrow syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>function getVerifiedToken(selector) {\n  return getUsers(selector)\n    .then(users => users[0])\n    .then(verifyUser)\n    .then((user, verifiedToken) => verifiedToken)\n    .catch(err => log(err.stack));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A few important things to notice here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We've lost <code>function</code> and <code>{}</code> because all of our callback functions are one liners.</li>\n<li>We've lost <code>()</code> around the argument list when there's just one argument (rest arguments are an exception, eg <code>(...args) => ...</code>)</li>\n<li>We've lost the <code>return</code> keyword because when omitting <code>{}</code>, single line arrow functions perform an implicit return (these functions are often referred to as lambda functions in other languages).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's important to reinforce the last point. Implicit return only happens for single statement arrow functions. When arrow function is declared with <code>{}</code>, even if it's a single statement, implicit return does not happen:</p>\n<pre><code>const getVerifiedToken = selector => {\n  return getUsers()\n    .then(users => users[0])\n    .then(verifyUser)\n    .then((user, verifiedToken) => verifiedToken)\n    .catch(err => log(err.stack));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's the really fun bit. Because our function has only one statement, we can still get rid of the <code>{}</code> and it will look almost exactly like <a href=\"http://coffeescript.org/\">CoffeeScript</a> syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>const getVerifiedToken = selector =>\n  getUsers()\n    .then(users => users[0])\n    .then(verifyUser)\n    .then((user, verifiedToken) => verifiedToken)\n    .catch(err => log(err.stack));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Yep, the example above is completely valid ES2015 syntax (I was also surprised that it <a href=\"http://babeljs.io/repl/#?\">compiles fine</a>). When we talk about single statement arrow functions, it doesn't mean the statement can't be spread out to multiple lines for better comprehension.</p>\n<p>There's one caveat, however, with omitting <code>{}</code> from arrow functions -- how do you return an empty object, eg <code>{}</code>?</p>\n<pre><code>const emptyObject = () => {};\nemptyObject(); // ?\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately there's no way to distinguish between empty block <code>{}</code> and an object <code>{}</code>. Because of that <code>emptyObject()</code> evaluates to <code>undefined</code> and <code>{}</code> interpreted as empty block. To return an empty object from fat arrow functions you have to surround it with brackets like so <code>({})</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const emptyObject = () => ({});\nemptyObject(); // {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's all of the above together:</p>\n<pre><code>function () { return 1; }\n() => { return 1; }\n() => 1\n\nfunction (a) { return a * 2; }\n(a) => { return a * 2; }\n(a) => a * 2\na => a * 2\n\nfunction (a, b) { return a * b; }\n(a, b) => { return a * b; }\n(a, b) => a * b\n\nfunction () { return arguments[0]; }\n(...args) => args[0]\n\n() => {} // undefined\n() => ({}) // {}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Lexical <code>this</code></h2>\n<p>The story of clobbering <code>this</code> in JavaScript is a really old one. Each <code>function</code> in JavaScript defines its own <code>this</code> context, which is as easy to get around as it is annoying. The example below tries to display a clock that updates every second using jQuery:</p>\n<pre><code>$('.current-time').each(function () {\n  setInterval(function () {\n    $(this).text(Date.now());\n  }, 1000);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>When attempting to reference the DOM element <code>this</code> set by <code>each</code> in the <code>setInterval</code> callback, we unfortunately get a brand new <code>this</code> that belongs to the callback itself. A common way around this is to declare <code>that</code> or <code>self</code> variable:</p>\n<pre><code>$('.current-time').each(function () {\n  var self = this;\n\n  setInterval(function () {\n    $(self).text(Date.now());\n  }, 1000);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The fat arrow functions allow you to solve this problem because they don't introduce their own <code>this</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>$('.current-time').each(function () {\n  setInterval(() => $(this).text(Date.now()), 1000);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What about arguments?</h2>\n<p>One of the caveats with arrow functions is that they also don't have their own <code>arguments</code> variable like regular functions:</p>\n<pre><code>function log(msg) {\n  const print = () => console.log(arguments[0]);\n  print(`LOG: ${msg}`);\n}\n\nlog('hello'); // hello\n</code></pre>\n<p>To reiterate, fat arrow functions don't have their own <code>this</code> and <code>arguments</code>. Having said that, you can still get all arguments passed into the arrow functions using rest parameters (also known as spread operator):</p>\n<pre><code>function log(msg) {\n  const print = (...args) => console.log(args[0]);\n  print(`LOG: ${msg}`);\n}\n\nlog('hello'); // LOG: hello\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What about yield?</h2>\n<p>Fat arrow functions can't be used as generators. That's it -- no exceptions, no caveats and no workarounds.</p>\n<h2>Bottom Line</h2>\n<p>Fat arrow functions are one of my favorite additions to JavaScript. It might be very tempting to just start using <code>=></code> instead of <code>function</code> everywhere. I've seen whole libraries written just using <code>=></code> and I don't think it's the right thing to do because of the special features that <code>=></code> introduces. I recommend using arrow functions only in places where you explicitly want to use the new features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single statement functions that immediately return (lambdas)</li>\n<li>Functions that need to work with parent scope <code>this</code></li>\n</ul>"},{"url":"/docs/javascript/asyncjs/","relativePath":"docs/javascript/asyncjs.md","relativeDir":"docs/javascript","base":"asyncjs.md","name":"asyncjs","frontmatter":{"title":"AsynchAsynchronous JavaScript","weight":0,"excerpt":"AsynchAsynchronous JavaScript","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>\n<h1>Async functions:</h1>\n<p>Let's start with the <code>async</code> keyword. It can be placed before a function, like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function f() {\n    return 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The word \"async\" before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.</p>\n<p>For instance, this function returns a resolved promise with the result of <code>1</code>; let's test it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function f() {\n    return 1;\n}\n\nf().then(alert); // 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>...We could explicitly return a promise, which would be the same:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function f() {\n    return Promise.resolve(1);\n}\n\nf().then(alert); // 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, <code>async</code> ensures that the function returns a promise, and wraps non-promises in it. Simple enough, right? But not only that. There's another keyword, <code>await</code>, that works only inside <code>async</code> functions, and it's pretty cool.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#await\">Await</a></h2>\n<p>The syntax:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// works only inside async functions\nlet value = await promise;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The keyword <code>await</code> makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.</p>\n<p>Here's an example with a promise that resolves in 1 second:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function f() {\n    let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n        setTimeout(() => resolve('done!'), 1000);\n    });\n\n    let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)\n\n    alert(result); // \"done!\"\n}\n\nf();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The function execution \"pauses\" at the line <code>(*)</code> and resumes when the promise settles, with <code>result</code> becoming its result. So the code above shows \"done!\" in one second.</p>\n<p>Let's emphasize: <code>await</code> literally suspends the function execution until the promise settles, and then resumes it with the promise result. That doesn't cost any CPU resources, because the JavaScript engine can do other jobs in the meantime: execute other scripts, handle events, etc.</p>\n<p>It's just a more elegant syntax of getting the promise result than <code>promise.then</code>. And, it's easier to read and write.</p>\n<p>Can't use <code>await</code> in regular functions</p>\n<p>If we try to use <code>await</code> in a non-async function, there would be a syntax error:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function f() {\n    let promise = Promise.resolve(1);\n    let result = await promise; // Syntax error\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We may get this error if we forget to put <code>async</code> before a function. As stated earlier, <code>await</code> only works inside an <code>async</code> function.</p>\n<p>Let's take the <code>showAvatar()</code> example from the chapter <a href=\"promise-chaining\">Promises chaining</a> and rewrite it using <code>async/await</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We'll need to replace <code>.then</code> calls with <code>await</code>.</li>\n<li>Also we should make the function <code>async</code> for them to work.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function showAvatar() {\n    // read our JSON\n    let response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');\n    let user = await response.json();\n\n    // read github user\n    let githubResponse = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${user.name}`);\n    let githubUser = await githubResponse.json();\n\n    // show the avatar\n    let img = document.createElement('img');\n    img.src = githubUser.avatar_url;\n    img.className = 'promise-avatar-example';\n    document.body.append(img);\n\n    // wait 3 seconds\n    await new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));\n\n    img.remove();\n\n    return githubUser;\n}\n\nshowAvatar();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Pretty clean and easy to read, right? Much better than before.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">await` won't work in the top-level code\n\nPeople who are just starting to use `await` tend to forget the fact that we can't use `await` in top-level code. For example, this will not work:\n\n\n```js\n// syntax error in top-level code\nlet response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');\nlet user = await response.json();\n</code></pre>\n<p>But we can wrap it into an anonymous async function, like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">(async () => {\n  let response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');\n  let user = await response.json();\n  ...\n})();\n</code></pre>\n<p>P.S. New feature: starting from V8 engine version 8.9+, top-level await works in <a href=\"modules\">modules</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">await` accepts \"thenables\"\n\nLike `promise.then`, `await` allows us to use thenable objects (those with a callable `then` method). The idea is that a third-party object may not be a promise, but promise-compatible: if it supports `.then`, that's enough to use it with `await`.\n\nHere's a demo `Thenable` class; the `await` below accepts its instances:\n\n\n```js\nclass Thenable {\n  constructor(num) {\n    this.num = num;\n  }\n  then(resolve, reject) {\n    alert(resolve);\n    // resolve with this.num*2 after 1000ms\n    setTimeout(() => resolve(this.num * 2), 1000); // (*)\n  }\n}\n\nasync function f() {\n  // waits for 1 second, then result becomes 2\n  let result = await new Thenable(1);\n  alert(result);\n}\n\nf();\n</code></pre>\n<p>If <code>await</code> gets a non-promise object with <code>.then</code>, it calls that method providing the built-in functions <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> as arguments (just as it does for a regular <code>Promise</code> executor). Then <code>await</code> waits until one of them is called (in the example above it happens in the line <code>(*)</code>) and then proceeds with the result.</p>\n<p>Async class methods</p>\n<p>To declare an async class method, just prepend it with <code>async</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">class Waiter {\n    async wait() {\n        return await Promise.resolve(1);\n    }\n}\n\nnew Waiter().wait().then(alert); // 1 (this is the same as (result => alert(result)))\n</code></pre>\n<p>The meaning is the same: it ensures that the returned value is a promise and enables <code>await</code>.</p>\n<h2>[Error handling]</h2>\n<p>If a promise resolves normally, then <code>await promise</code> returns the result. But in the case of a rejection, it throws the error, just as if there were a <code>throw</code> statement at that line.</p>\n<p>This code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function f() {\n    await Promise.reject(new Error('Whoops!'));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>...is the same as this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function f() {\n    throw new Error('Whoops!');\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In real situations, the promise may take some time before it rejects. In that case there will be a delay before <code>await</code> throws an error.</p>\n<p>We can catch that error using <code>try..catch</code>, the same way as a regular <code>throw</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function f() {\n    try {\n        let response = await fetch('http://no-such-url');\n    } catch (err) {\n        alert(err); // TypeError: failed to fetch\n    }\n}\n\nf();\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the case of an error, the control jumps to the <code>catch</code> block. We can also wrap multiple lines:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function f() {\n    try {\n        let response = await fetch('/no-user-here');\n        let user = await response.json();\n    } catch (err) {\n        // catches errors both in fetch and response.json\n        alert(err);\n    }\n}\n\nf();\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we don't have <code>try..catch</code>, then the promise generated by the call of the async function <code>f()</code> becomes rejected. We can append <code>.catch</code> to handle it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async function f() {\n    let response = await fetch('http://no-such-url');\n}\n\n// f() becomes a rejected promise\nf().catch(alert); // TypeError: failed to fetch // (*)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we forget to add <code>.catch</code> there, then we get an unhandled promise error (viewable in the console). We can catch such errors using a global <code>unhandledrejection</code> event handler as described in the chapter <a href=\"promise-error-handling\">Error handling with promises</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async/await` and `promise.then/catch\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we use <code>async/await</code>, we rarely need <code>.then</code>, because <code>await</code> handles the waiting for us. And we can use a regular <code>try..catch</code> instead of <code>.catch</code>. That's usually (but not always) more convenient.</p>\n<p>But at the top level of the code, when we're outside any <code>async</code> function, we're syntactically unable to use <code>await</code>, so it's a normal practice to add <code>.then/catch</code> to handle the final result or falling-through error, like in the line <code>(*)</code> of the example above.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">async/await` works well with `Promise.all\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we need to wait for multiple promises, we can wrap them in <code>Promise.all</code> and then <code>await</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// wait for the array of results\nlet results = await Promise.all([\n  fetch(url1),\n  fetch(url2),\n  ...\n]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the case of an error, it propagates as usual, from the failed promise to <code>Promise.all</code>, and then becomes an exception that we can catch using <code>try..catch</code> around the call.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#summary\">Summary</a></h2>\n<p>The <code>async</code> keyword before a function has two effects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Makes it always return a promise.</li>\n<li>Allows <code>await</code> to be used in it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <code>await</code> keyword before a promise makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles, and then:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If it's an error, the exception is generated --- same as if <code>throw error</code> were called at that very place.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, it returns the result.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Together they provide a great framework to write asynchronous code that is easy to both read and write.</p>\n<p>With <code>async/await</code> we rarely need to write <code>promise.then/catch</code>, but we still shouldn't forget that they are based on promises, because sometimes (e.g. in the outermost scope) we have to use these methods. Also <code>Promise.all</code> is nice when we are waiting for many tasks simultaneously.</p>\n<h2>Cleaning up your asynchronous code with <code>await</code></h2>\n<p>REPLs have traditionally had a difficult time allowing you to interact with asynchronous code since they encourage a coding style where you evaluate expressions and use those results in the next field. But if you are using promises or callbacks, this breaks down because these results exist only in the callback, not the next line:</p>\n<p>In RunKit, you can use top-level <code>await</code> to get the same behavior of synchronous code.</p>\n<p>Now we can treat this code as synchronous, despite the fact that the code is still executing asynchronously.</p>\n<p>Let's look how. It helps to have a more complex example, where we need to do a few asynchronous operations in sequence. You can see how <code>await</code>, promises and callbacks achieve the same results, but the <code>await</code> style works better in a REPL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>await</li>\n<li>promises</li>\n<li>callbacks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here, we use <code>await</code> on lines 4 and 8, and the results from each request remain in scope.</p>\n<p>Remember, <code>await</code> expects a <code>promise</code> so you can either write your own or use one of the many libraries that natively supports promises, and npm is full of packages that add promise support to existing libraries. Here are a few of our favorites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://npm.runkit.com/fs-promise\">fs-promise</a> - promise based filesystem api</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://npm.runkit.com/request-promise\">request-promise</a> - a wrapper around \"request\" for http stuff</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://npm.runkit.com/glob-promise\">glob-promise</a> - glob style filesystem queries</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://npm.runkit.com/bluebird\">bluebird</a> - general promise library with lots of utilities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Further Reading</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://rossboucher.com/await\">ES7 Async/Await presented at Brookyln.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lukehoban/ecmascript-asyncawait/\">ECMAScript's Proposal for async/await</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://esdiscuss.org/notes/2014-01-30#async-await\">ES Meeting Notes discussing on async/await</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://esdiscuss.org/topic/does-async-await-solve-a-real-problem\">Does async/await Solve a Real Problem?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thomashunter.name/blog/the-long-road-to-asyncawait-in-javascript/\">The Long Road to async/await in JavaScript</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/10/asyncawait-the-hero-javascript-deserved.html\">async/await: The Hero JavaScript Deserved</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"url":"/docs/javascript/await-keyword/","relativePath":"docs/javascript/await-keyword.md","relativeDir":"docs/javascript","base":"await-keyword.md","name":"await-keyword","frontmatter":{"title":"Await ","weight":0,"excerpt":"Async and await","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>await</h1>\n<p>The <code>await</code> operator is used to wait for a <a href=\"../global_objects/promise\"><code>Promise</code></a>.

When resumed, the value of the <code>await</code> expression is that of the fulfilled <code>Promise</code>.</p>\n<p>If the <code>Promise</code> is rejected, the <code>await</code> expression throws the rejected value.</p>\n<p>If the value of the <em>expression</em> following the <code>await</code> operator is not a <code>Promise</code>, it's converted to a <a href=\"../global_objects/promise/resolve\">resolved Promise</a>.</p>\n<p>An <code>await</code> splits execution flow, allowing the caller of the async function to resume execution. After the <code>await</code> defers the continuation of the async function, execution of subsequent statements ensues. If this <code>await</code> is the last expression executed by its function, execution continues by returning to the function's caller a pending <code>Promise</code> for completion of the <code>await</code>'s function and resuming execution of that caller.</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<h3>Awaiting a promise to be fulfilled</h3>\n<p>If a <code>Promise</code> is passed to an <code>await</code> expression, it waits for the <code>Promise</code> to be fulfilled and returns the fulfilled value.</p>\n<pre><code>function resolveAfter2Seconds(x) {\n  return new Promise(resolve => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve(x);\n    }, 2000);\n  });\n}\n\nasync function f1() {\n  var x = await resolveAfter2Seconds(10);\n  console.log(x); // 10\n}\n\nf1();\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Thenable objects</h3>\n<p><a href=\"../global_objects/promise/then\"><code>Thenable objects</code></a> will be fulfilled just the same.</p>\n<pre><code>async function f2() {\n  const thenable = {\n    then: function(resolve, _reject) {\n      resolve('resolved!')\n    }\n  };\n  console.log(await thenable); // resolved!\n}\n\nf2();\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Conversion to promise</h3>\n<p>If the value is not a <code>Promise</code>, it converts the value to a resolved <code>Promise</code>, and waits for it.</p>\n<pre><code>async function f3() {\n  var y = await 20;\n  console.log(y); // 20\n}\n\nf3();\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Promise rejection</h3>\n<p>If the <code>Promise</code> is rejected, the rejected value is thrown.</p>\n<pre><code>async function f4() {\n  try {\n    var z = await Promise.reject(30);\n  } catch(e) {\n    console.error(e); // 30\n  }\n}\n\nf4();\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Handling rejected promises</h3>\n<p>Handle rejected <code>Promise</code> without try block.</p>\n<pre><code>var response = await promisedFunction().catch((err) => { console.error(err); });\n// response will be undefined if the promise is rejected\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Top level await</h3>\n<p>You can use the <code>await</code> keyword on its own (outside of an async function) within a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules\">JavaScript module</a>.

These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are\nones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of\n<em>Clean Code</em>.</p>\n<p>Our craft of software engineering is just a bit over 50 years old, and we are\nstill learning a lot.

It's important that the code we\ndo write is readable and searchable. By <em>not</em> naming variables that end up\nbeing meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.\nMake your names searchable.

Be aware that if you\nuse them, your function will only provide default values for <code>undefined</code>\narguments. Other \"falsy\" values such as <code>''</code>, <code>\"\"</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>0</code>, and\n<code>NaN</code>, will not be replaced by a default value.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function createMicrobrewery(name) {\n    const breweryName = name || 'Hipster Brew Co.';\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function createMicrobrewery(name = 'Hipster Brew Co.') {\n    // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2><strong>Functions</strong></h2>\n<h3>Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)</h3>\n<p>Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it\nmakes testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a\ncombinatorial explosion where you have to test tons of different cases with\neach separate argument.</p>\n<p>One or two arguments is the ideal case, and three should be avoided if possible.\nAnything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have\nmore than two arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases\nwhere it's not, most of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an\nargument.</p>\n<p>Since JavaScript allows you to make objects on the fly, without a lot of class\nboilerplate, you can use an object if you are finding yourself needing a\nlot of arguments.</p>\n<p>To make it obvious what properties the function expects, you can use the ES2015/ES6\ndestructuring syntax. This has a few advantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When someone looks at the function signature, it's immediately clear what\nproperties are being used.</li>\n<li>It can be used to simulate named parameters.</li>\n<li>Destructuring also clones the specified primitive values of the argument\nobject passed into the function. This can help prevent side effects.

If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!</p>\n<p>Oftentimes you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly\ndifferent things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you\nto have two or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing\nduplicate code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of\ndifferent things with just one function/module/class.</p>\n<p>Getting the abstraction right is critical, that's why you should follow the\nSOLID principles laid out in the <em>Classes</em> section. Bad abstractions can be\nworse than duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make\na good abstraction, do it!

A side effect could be writing to a file,\nmodifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a\nstranger.</p>\n<p>Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous\nexample, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to\ncentralize where you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes\nthat write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.</p>\n<p>The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects\nwithout any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,\nand not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will\nbe happier than the vast majority of other programmers.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Global variable referenced by following function.\n// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it could break it.\nlet name = 'Ryan McDermott';\n\nfunction splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {\n    name = name.split(' ');\n}\n\nsplitIntoFirstAndLastName();\n\nconsole.log(name); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name) {\n    return name.split(' ');\n}\n\nconst name = 'Ryan McDermott';\nconst newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name);\n\nconsole.log(name); // 'Ryan McDermott';\nconsole.log(newName); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Avoid Side Effects (part 2)</h3>\n<p>In JavaScript, some values are unchangeable (immutable) and some are changeable\n(mutable). Objects and arrays are two kinds of mutable values so it's important\nto handle them carefully when they're passed as parameters to a function. A\nJavaScript function can change an object's properties or alter the contents of\nan array which could easily cause bugs elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Suppose there's a function that accepts an array parameter representing a\nshopping cart. If the function makes a change in that shopping cart array -\nby adding an item to purchase, for example - then any other function that\nuses that same <code>cart</code> array will be affected by this addition. That may be\ngreat, however it could also be bad. Let's imagine a bad situation:</p>\n<p>The user clicks the \"Purchase\" button which calls a <code>purchase</code> function that\nspawns a network request and sends the <code>cart</code> array to the server. Because\nof a bad network connection, the <code>purchase</code> function has to keep retrying the\nrequest. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks an \"Add to Cart\"\nbutton on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins?\nIf that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function\nwill send the accidentally added item because the <code>cart</code> array was modified.</p>\n<p>A great solution would be for the <code>addItemToCart</code> function to always clone the\n<code>cart</code>, edit it, and return the clone. This would ensure that functions that are still\nusing the old shopping cart wouldn't be affected by the changes.</p>\n<p>Two caveats to mention to this approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,\nbut when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases\nare pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!</li>\n<li>Cloning big objects can be very expensive in terms of performance. Luckily,\nthis isn't a big issue in practice because there are\n<a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/\">great libraries</a> that allow\nthis kind of programming approach to be fast and not as memory intensive as\nit would be for you to manually clone objects and arrays.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {\n    cart.push({ item, date: Date.now() });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {\n    return [...cart, { item, date: Date.now() }];\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Don't write to global functions</h3>\n<p>Polluting globals is a bad practice in JavaScript because you could clash with another\nlibrary and the user of your API would be none-the-wiser until they get an\nexception in production. Let's think about an example: what if you wanted to\nextend JavaScript's native Array method to have a <code>diff</code> method that could\nshow the difference between two arrays? You could write your new function\nto the <code>Array.prototype</code>, but it could clash with another library that tried\nto do the same thing. What if that other library was just using <code>diff</code> to find\nthe difference between the first and last elements of an array? This is why it\nwould be much better to just use ES2015/ES6 classes and simply extend the <code>Array</code> global.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">Array.prototype.diff = function diff(comparisonArray) {\n    const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);\n    return this.filter((elem) => !hash.has(elem));\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">class SuperArray extends Array {\n    diff(comparisonArray) {\n        const hash = new Set(comparisonArray);\n        return this.filter((elem) => !hash.has(elem));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Favor functional programming over imperative programming</h3>\n<p>JavaScript isn't a functional language in the way that Haskell is, but it has\na functional flavor to it.

There are lots of\ngood reasons to use inheritance and lots of good reasons to use composition.\nThe main point for this maxim is that if your mind instinctively goes for\ninheritance, try to think if composition could model your problem better. In some\ncases it can.</p>\n<p>You might be wondering then, \"when should I use inheritance?\" It\ndepends on your problem at hand, but this is a decent list of when inheritance\nmakes more sense than composition:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your inheritance represents an \"is-a\" relationship and not a \"has-a\"\nrelationship (Human->Animal vs. User->UserDetails).</li>\n<li>You can reuse code from the base classes (Humans can move like all animals).</li>\n<li>You want to make global changes to derived classes by changing a base class.\n(Change the caloric expenditure of all animals when they move).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">class Employee {\n    constructor(name, email) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.email = email;\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n\n// Bad because Employees \"have\" tax data.

It's tempting to jam-pack a class with a lot of functionality, like\nwhen you can only take one suitcase on your flight. The issue with this is\nthat your class won't be conceptually cohesive and it will give it many reasons\nto change. Minimizing the amount of times you need to change a class is important.\nIt's important because if too much functionality is in one class and you modify\na piece of it, it can be difficult to understand how that will affect other\ndependent modules in your codebase.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">class UserSettings {\n    constructor(user) {\n        this.user = user;\n    }\n\n    changeSettings(settings) {\n        if (this.verifyCredentials()) {\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n\n    verifyCredentials() {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">class UserAuth {\n    constructor(user) {\n        this.user = user;\n    }\n\n    verifyCredentials() {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nclass UserSettings {\n    constructor(user) {\n        this.user = user;\n        this.auth = new UserAuth(user);\n    }\n\n    changeSettings(settings) {\n        if (this.auth.verifyCredentials()) {\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h3>\n<p>As stated by Bertrand Meyer, \"software entities (classes, modules, functions,\netc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\" What does that\nmean though?

Details should depend on\nabstractions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with AngularJS,\nyou've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency\nInjection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level\nmodules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up.\nIt can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces\nthe coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because\nit makes your code hard to refactor.</p>\n<p>As stated previously, JavaScript doesn't have interfaces so the abstractions\nthat are depended upon are implicit contracts.

They mean the runtime has successfully\nidentified when something in your program has gone wrong and it's letting\nyou know by stopping function execution on the current stack, killing the\nprocess (in Node), and notifying you in the console with a stack trace.</p>\n<h3>Don't ignore caught errors</h3>\n<p>Doing nothing with a caught error doesn't give you the ability to ever fix\nor react to said error. Logging the error to the console (<code>console.log</code>)\nisn't much better as often times it can get lost in a sea of things printed\nto the console. If you wrap any bit of code in a <code>try/catch</code> it means you\nthink an error may occur there and therefore you should have a plan,\nor create a code path, for when it occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">try {\n    functionThatMightThrow();\n} catch (error) {\n    console.log(error);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">try {\n    functionThatMightThrow();\n} catch (error) {\n    // One option (more noisy than console.log):\n    console.error(error);\n    // Another option:\n    notifyUserOfError(error);\n    // Another option:\n    reportErrorToService(error);\n    // OR do all three!\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Don't ignore rejected promises</h3>\n<p>For the same reason you shouldn't ignore caught errors\nfrom <code>try/catch</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">getdata()\n    .then((data) => {\n        functionThatMightThrow(data);\n    })\n    .catch((error) => {\n        console.log(error);\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">getdata()\n    .then((data) => {\n        functionThatMightThrow(data);\n    })\n    .catch((error) => {\n        // One option (more noisy than console.log):\n        console.error(error);\n        // Another option:\n        notifyUserOfError(error);\n        // Another option:\n        reportErrorToService(error);\n        // OR do all three!\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<h2><strong>Formatting</strong></h2>\n<p>Formatting is subjective. Like many rules herein, there is no hard and fast\nrule that you must follow. The main point is DO NOT ARGUE over formatting.\nThere are <a href=\"https://standardjs.com/rules.html\">tons of tools</a> to automate this.\nUse one! It's a waste of time and money for engineers to argue over formatting.</p>\n<p>For things that don't fall under the purview of automatic formatting\n(indentation, tabs vs. spaces, double vs. single quotes, etc.) look here\nfor some guidance.</p>\n<h3>Use consistent capitalization</h3>\n<p>JavaScript is untyped, so capitalization tells you a lot about your variables,\nfunctions, etc. These rules are subjective, so your team can choose whatever\nthey want. The point is, no matter what you all choose, just be consistent.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;\nconst daysInMonth = 30;\n\nconst songs = ['Back In Black', 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Hey Jude'];\nconst Artists = ['ACDC', 'Led Zeppelin', 'The Beatles'];\n\nfunction eraseDatabase() {}\nfunction restore_database() {}\n\nclass animal {}\nclass Alpaca {}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">const DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7;\nconst DAYS_IN_MONTH = 30;\n\nconst SONGS = ['Back In Black', 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Hey Jude'];\nconst ARTISTS = ['ACDC', 'Led Zeppelin', 'The Beatles'];\n\nfunction eraseDatabase() {}\nfunction restoreDatabase() {}\n\nclass Animal {}\nclass Alpaca {}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Function callers and callees should be close</h3>\n<p>If a function calls another, keep those functions vertically close in the source\nfile.

In browsers, JavaScript shares a thread with a load of other stuff that differs from browser to browser. But typically JavaScript is in the same queue as painting, updating styles, and handling user actions (such as highlighting text and interacting with form controls). Activity in one of these things delays the others.</p>\n<p>As a human being, you're multithreaded. You can type with multiple fingers, you can drive and hold a conversation at the same time. The only blocking function we have to deal with is sneezing, where all current activity must be suspended for the duration of the sneeze. That's pretty annoying, especially when you're driving and trying to hold a conversation. You don't want to write code that's sneezy.</p>\n<p>You've probably used events and callbacks to get around this. Here are events:</p>\n<pre><code>var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');img1.addEventListener('load', function() {  // woo yey image loaded});img1.addEventListener('error', function() {  // argh everything's broken});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This isn't sneezy at all. We get the image, add a couple of listeners, then JavaScript can stop executing until one of those listeners is called.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the example above, it's possible that the events happened before we started listening for them, so we need to work around that using the \"complete\" property of images:</p>\n<pre><code>var img1 = document.querySelector('.img-1');function loaded() {  // woo yey image loaded}if (img1.complete) {  loaded();}else {  img1.addEventListener('load', loaded);}img1.addEventListener('error', function() {  // argh everything's broken});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This doesn't catch images that errored before we got a chance to listen for them; unfortunately the DOM doesn't give us a way to do that. Also, this is loading one image. Things get even more complex if we want to know when a set of images have loaded.</p>\n<h2>Events aren't always the best way <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#events-aren&#x27;t-always-the-best-way\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Events are great for things that can happen multiple times on the same object---<code>keyup</code>, <code>touchstart</code> etc. With those events you don't really care about what happened before you attached the listener. But when it comes to async success/failure, ideally you want something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>img1.callThisIfLoadedOrWhenLoaded(function() {  // loaded}).orIfFailedCallThis(function() {  // failed});// and...whenAllTheseHaveLoaded([img1, img2]).callThis(function() {  // all loaded}).orIfSomeFailedCallThis(function() {  // one or more failed});\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is what promises do, but with better naming. If HTML image elements had a \"ready\" method that returned a promise, we could do this:</p>\n<pre><code>img1.ready().then(function() {  // loaded}, function() {  // failed});// and...Promise.all([img1.ready(), img2.ready()]).then(function() {  // all loaded}, function() {  // one or more failed});\n</code></pre>\n<p>At their most basic, promises are a bit like event listeners except:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A promise can only succeed or fail once. It cannot succeed or fail twice, neither can it switch from success to failure or vice versa.</li>\n<li>If a promise has succeeded or failed and you later add a success/failure callback, the correct callback will be called, even though the event took place earlier.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is extremely useful for async success/failure, because you're less interested in the exact time something became available, and more interested in reacting to the outcome.</p>\n<h2>Promise terminology <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#promise-terminology\">#</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/domenic\">Domenic Denicola</a> proof read the first draft of this article and graded me \"F\" for terminology. He put me in detention, forced me to copy out <a href=\"https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping/blob/master/docs/states-and-fates.md\">States and Fates</a> 100 times, and wrote a worried letter to my parents. Despite that, I still get a lot of the terminology mixed up, but here are the basics:</p>\n<p>A promise can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fulfilled - The action relating to the promise succeeded</li>\n<li>rejected - The action relating to the promise failed</li>\n<li>pending - Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet</li>\n<li>settled - Has fulfilled or rejected</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/#sec-promise-objects\">The spec</a> also uses the term thenable to describe an object that is promise-like, in that it has a <code>then</code> method. This term reminds me of ex-England Football Manager <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Venables\">Terry Venables</a> so I'll be using it as little as possible.</p>\n<h2>Promises arrive in JavaScript! <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#promises-arrive-in-javascript!\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Promises have been around for a while in the form of libraries, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kriskowal/q\">Q</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cujojs/when\">when</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211867.aspx\">WinJS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js\">RSVP.js</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above and JavaScript promises share a common, standardized behaviour called <a href=\"https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec\">Promises/A+</a>. If you're a jQuery user, they have something similar called <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/\">Deferreds</a>. However, Deferreds aren't Promise/A+ compliant, which makes them <a href=\"https://thewayofcode.wordpress.com/tag/jquery-deferred-broken/\">subtly different and less useful</a>, so beware. jQuery also has <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/Types/#Promise\">a Promise type</a>, but this is just a subset of Deferred and has the same issues.</p>\n<p>Although promise implementations follow a standardized behaviour, their overall APIs differ. JavaScript promises are similar in API to RSVP.js. Here's how you create a promise:</p>\n<pre><code>var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  // do a thing, possibly async, then...  if (/* everything turned out fine */) {    resolve(\"Stuff worked!\");  }  else {    reject(Error(\"It broke\"));  }});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The promise constructor takes one argument, a callback with two parameters, resolve and reject. Do something within the callback, perhaps async, then call resolve if everything worked, otherwise call reject.</p>\n<p>Like <code>throw</code> in plain old JavaScript, it's customary, but not required, to reject with an Error object. The benefit of Error objects is they capture a stack trace, making debugging tools more helpful.</p>\n<p>Here's how you use that promise:</p>\n<pre><code>promise.then(function(result) {  console.log(result); // \"Stuff worked!\"}, function(err) {  console.log(err); // Error: \"It broke\"});\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>then()</code> takes two arguments, a callback for a success case, and another for the failure case. Both are optional, so you can add a callback for the success or failure case only.</p>\n<p>JavaScript promises started out in the DOM as \"Futures\", renamed to \"Promises\", and finally moved into JavaScript. Having them in JavaScript rather than the DOM is great because they'll be available in non-browser JS contexts such as Node.js (whether they make use of them in their core APIs is another question).</p>\n<p>Although they're a JavaScript feature, the DOM isn't afraid to use them. In fact, all new DOM APIs with async success/failure methods will use promises. This is happening already with <a href=\"https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/quota/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#idl-def-StorageQuota\">Quota Management</a>, <a href=\"http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-font-loading/#font-face-set-ready\">Font Load Events</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker/blob/cf459d473ae09f6994e8539113d277cbd2bce939/service_worker.ts#L17\">ServiceWorker</a>, <a href=\"https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#widl-Navigator-requestMIDIAccess-Promise-MIDIOptions-options\">Web MIDI</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/streams#basereadablestream\">Streams</a>, and more.</p>\n<h2>Browser support &#x26; polyfill <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#browser-support-and-polyfill\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are already implementations of promises in browsers today.</p>\n<p>As of Chrome 32, Opera 19, Firefox 29, Safari 8 &#x26; Microsoft Edge, promises are enabled by default.</p>\n<p>To bring browsers that lack a complete promises implementation up to spec compliance, or add promises to other browsers and Node.js, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/jakearchibald/ES6-Promises#readme\">the polyfill</a> (2k gzipped).</p>\n<h2>Compatibility with other libraries <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#compatibility-with-other-libraries\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The JavaScript promises API will treat anything with a <code>then()</code> method as promise-like (or <code>thenable</code> in promise-speak <em>sigh</em>), so if you use a library that returns a Q promise, that's fine, it'll play nice with the new JavaScript promises.</p>\n<p>Although, as I mentioned, jQuery's Deferreds are a bit ... unhelpful. Thankfully you can cast them to standard promises, which is worth doing as soon as possible:</p>\n<pre><code>var jsPromise = Promise.resolve($.ajax('/whatever.json'))\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, jQuery's <code>$.ajax</code> returns a Deferred. Since it has a <code>then()</code> method, <code>Promise.resolve()</code> can turn it into a JavaScript promise. However, sometimes deferreds pass multiple arguments to their callbacks, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>var jqDeferred = $.ajax('/whatever.json');jqDeferred.then(function(response, statusText, xhrObj) {  // ...}, function(xhrObj, textStatus, err) {  // ...})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whereas JS promises ignore all but the first:</p>\n<pre><code>jsPromise.then(function(response) {  // ...}, function(xhrObj) {  // ...})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thankfully this is usually what you want, or at least gives you access to what you want. Also, be aware that jQuery doesn't follow the convention of passing Error objects into rejections.</p>\n<h2>Complex async code made easier <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#complex-async-code-made-easier\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Right, let's code some things. Say we want to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start a spinner to indicate loading</li>\n<li>Fetch some JSON for a story, which gives us the title, and urls for each chapter</li>\n<li>Add title to the page</li>\n<li>Fetch each chapter</li>\n<li>Add the story to the page</li>\n<li>Stop the spinner</li>\n</ol>\n<p>... but also tell the user if something went wrong along the way. We'll want to stop the spinner at that point too, else it'll keep on spinning, get dizzy, and crash into some other UI.</p>\n<p>Of course, you wouldn't use JavaScript to deliver a story, <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2013/progressive-enhancement-is-faster/\">serving as HTML is faster</a>, but this pattern is pretty common when dealing with APIs: Multiple data fetches, then do something when it's all done.</p>\n<p>To start with, let's deal with fetching data from the network:</p>\n<h2>Promisifying XMLHttpRequest <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#promisifying-xmlhttprequest\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Old APIs will be updated to use promises, if it's possible in a backwards compatible way. <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is a prime candidate, but in the mean time let's write a simple function to make a GET request:</p>\n<pre><code>function get(url) {  // Return a new promise.  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {    // Do the usual XHR stuff    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();    req.open('GET', url);    req.onload = function() {      // This is called even on 404 etc      // so check the status      if (req.status == 200) {        // Resolve the promise with the response text        resolve(req.response);      }      else {        // Otherwise reject with the status text        // which will hopefully be a meaningful error        reject(Error(req.statusText));      }    };    // Handle network errors    req.onerror = function() {      reject(Error(\"Network Error\"));    };    // Make the request    req.send();  });}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let's use it:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);}, function(error) {  console.error(\"Failed!\", error);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can make HTTP requests without manually typing <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, which is great, because the less I have to see the infuriating camel-casing of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, the happier my life will be.</p>\n<h2>Chaining <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#chaining\">#</a></h2>\n<p><code>then()</code> isn't the end of the story, you can chain <code>then</code>s together to transform values or run additional async actions one after another.</p>\n<h3>Transforming values <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#transforming-values\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can transform values simply by returning the new value:</p>\n<pre><code>var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  resolve(1);});promise.then(function(val) {  console.log(val); // 1  return val + 2;}).then(function(val) {  console.log(val); // 3})\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a practical example, let's go back to:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>The response is JSON, but we're currently receiving it as plain text. We could alter our get function to use the JSON <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#responseType\"><code>responseType</code></a>, but we could also solve it in promises land:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  return JSON.parse(response);}).then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Yey JSON!\", response);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since <code>JSON.parse()</code> takes a single argument and returns a transformed value, we can make a shortcut:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(JSON.parse).then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Yey JSON!\", response);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>In fact, we could make a <code>getJSON()</code> function really easily:</p>\n<pre><code>function getJSON(url) {  return get(url).then(JSON.parse);}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>getJSON()</code> still returns a promise, one that fetches a url then parses the response as JSON.</p>\n<h3>Queuing asynchronous actions <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#queuing-asynchronous-actions\">#</a></h3>\n<p>You can also chain <code>then</code>s to run async actions in sequence.</p>\n<p>When you return something from a <code>then()</code> callback, it's a bit magic. If you return a value, the next <code>then()</code> is called with that value. However, if you return something promise-like, the next <code>then()</code> waits on it, and is only called when that promise settles (succeeds/fails). For example:</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[0]);}).then(function(chapter1) {  console.log(\"Got chapter 1!\", chapter1);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we make an async request to <code>story.json</code>, which gives us a set of URLs to request, then we request the first of those. This is when promises really start to stand out from simple callback patterns.</p>\n<p>You could even make a shortcut method to get chapters:</p>\n<pre><code>var storyPromise;function getChapter(i) {  storyPromise = storyPromise || getJSON('story.json');  return storyPromise.then(function(story) {    return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[i]);  })}// and using it is simple:getChapter(0).then(function(chapter) {  console.log(chapter);  return getChapter(1);}).then(function(chapter) {  console.log(chapter);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>We don't download <code>story.json</code> until <code>getChapter</code> is called, but the next time(s) <code>getChapter</code> is called we reuse the story promise, so <code>story.json</code> is only fetched once. Yay Promises!</p>\n<h2>Error handling <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#error-handling\">#</a></h2>\n<p>As we saw earlier, <code>then()</code> takes two arguments, one for success, one for failure (or fulfill and reject, in promises-speak):</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);}, function(error) {  console.log(\"Failed!\", error);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also use <code>catch()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);}).catch(function(error) {  console.log(\"Failed!\", error);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>There's nothing special about <code>catch()</code>, it's just sugar for <code>then(undefined, func)</code>, but it's more readable. Note that the two code examples above do not behave the same, the latter is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre><code>get('story.json').then(function(response) {  console.log(\"Success!\", response);}).then(undefined, function(error) {  console.log(\"Failed!\", error);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>The difference is subtle, but extremely useful. Promise rejections skip forward to the next <code>then()</code> with a rejection callback (or <code>catch()</code>, since it's equivalent). With <code>then(func1, func2)</code>, <code>func1</code> or <code>func2</code> will be called, never both. But with <code>then(func1).catch(func2)</code>, both will be called if <code>func1</code> rejects, as they're separate steps in the chain. Take the following:</p>\n<pre><code>asyncThing1().then(function() {  return asyncThing2();}).then(function() {  return asyncThing3();}).catch(function(err) {  return asyncRecovery1();}).then(function() {  return asyncThing4();}, function(err) {  return asyncRecovery2();}).catch(function(err) {  console.log(\"Don't worry about it\");}).then(function() {  console.log(\"All done!\");})\n</code></pre>\n<p>The flow above is very similar to normal JavaScript try/catch, errors that happen within a \"try\" go immediately to the <code>catch()</code> block. Here's the above as a flowchart (because I love flowcharts):</p>\n<p>Follow the blue lines for promises that fulfill, or the red for ones that reject.</p>\n<h3>JavaScript exceptions and promises <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#javascript-exceptions-and-promises\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Rejections happen when a promise is explicitly rejected, but also implicitly if an error is thrown in the constructor callback:</p>\n<pre><code>var jsonPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {  // JSON.parse throws an error if you feed it some  // invalid JSON, so this implicitly rejects:  resolve(JSON.parse(\"This ain't JSON\"));});jsonPromise.then(function(data) {  // This never happens:  console.log(\"It worked!\", data);}).catch(function(err) {  // Instead, this happens:  console.log(\"It failed!\", err);})\n</code></pre>\n<p>This means it's useful to do all your promise-related work inside the promise constructor callback, so errors are automatically caught and become rejections.</p>\n<p>The same goes for errors thrown in <code>then()</code> callbacks.</p>\n<pre><code>get('/').then(JSON.parse).then(function() {  // This never happens, '/' is an HTML page, not JSON  // so JSON.parse throws  console.log(\"It worked!\", data);}).catch(function(err) {  // Instead, this happens:  console.log(\"It failed!\", err);})\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Error handling in practice <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#error-handling-in-practice\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With our story and chapters, we can use catch to display an error to the user:</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[0]);}).then(function(chapter1) {  addHtmlToPage(chapter1.html);}).catch(function() {  addTextToPage(\"Failed to show chapter\");}).then(function() {  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>If fetching <code>story.chapterUrls[0]</code> fails (e.g., http 500 or user is offline), it'll skip all following success callbacks, which includes the one in <code>getJSON()</code> which tries to parse the response as JSON, and also skips the callback that adds chapter1.html to the page. Instead it moves onto the catch callback. As a result, \"Failed to show chapter\" will be added to the page if any of the previous actions failed.</p>\n<p>Like JavaScript's try/catch, the error is caught and subsequent code continues, so the spinner is always hidden, which is what we want. The above becomes a non-blocking async version of:</p>\n<pre><code>try {  var story = getJSONSync('story.json');  var chapter1 = getJSONSync(story.chapterUrls[0]);  addHtmlToPage(chapter1.html);}catch (e) {  addTextToPage(\"Failed to show chapter\");}document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none'\n</code></pre>\n<p>You may want to <code>catch()</code> simply for logging purposes, without recovering from the error. To do this, just rethrow the error. We could do this in our <code>getJSON()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code>function getJSON(url) {  return get(url).then(JSON.parse).catch(function(err) {    console.log(\"getJSON failed for\", url, err);    throw err;  });}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we've managed to fetch one chapter, but we want them all. Let's make that happen.</p>\n<h2>Parallelism and sequencing: getting the best of both <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#parallelism-and-sequencing:-getting-the-best-of-both\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Thinking async isn't easy. If you're struggling to get off the mark, try writing the code as if it were synchronous. In this case:</p>\n<pre><code>try {  var story = getJSONSync('story.json');  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);  story.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {    var chapter = getJSONSync(chapterUrl);    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });  addTextToPage(\"All done\");}catch (err) {  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);}document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none'\n</code></pre>\n<p>That works! But it's sync and locks up the browser while things download. To make this work async we use <code>then()</code> to make things happen one after another.</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);  // TODO: for each url in story.chapterUrls, fetch &#x26;amp; display}).then(function() {  // And we're all done!  addTextToPage(\"All done\");}).catch(function(err) {  // Catch any error that happened along the way  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);}).then(function() {  // Always hide the spinner  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>But how can we loop through the chapter urls and fetch them in order? This doesn't work:</p>\n<pre><code>story.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {  // Fetch chapter  getJSON(chapterUrl).then(function(chapter) {    // and add it to the page    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });})\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>forEach</code> isn't async-aware, so our chapters would appear in whatever order they download, which is basically how Pulp Fiction was written. This isn't Pulp Fiction, so let's fix it.</p>\n<h3>Creating a sequence <a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/#creating-a-sequence\">#</a></h3>\n<p>We want to turn our <code>chapterUrls</code> array into a sequence of promises. We can do that using <code>then()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Start off with a promise that always resolvesvar sequence = Promise.resolve();// Loop through our chapter urlsstory.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {  // Add these actions to the end of the sequence  sequence = sequence.then(function() {    return getJSON(chapterUrl);  }).then(function(chapter) {    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });})\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the first time we've seen <code>Promise.resolve()</code>, which creates a promise that resolves to whatever value you give it. If you pass it an instance of <code>Promise</code> it'll simply return it (note: this is a change to the spec that some implementations don't yet follow). If you pass it something promise-like (has a <code>then()</code> method), it creates a genuine <code>Promise</code> that fulfills/rejects in the same way. If you pass in any other value, e.g., <code>Promise.resolve('Hello')</code>, it creates a promise that fulfills with that value. If you call it with no value, as above, it fulfills with \"undefined\".</p>\n<p>There's also <code>Promise.reject(val)</code>, which creates a promise that rejects with the value you give it (or undefined).</p>\n<p>We can tidy up the above code using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce\"><code>array.reduce</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Loop through our chapter urlsstory.chapterUrls.reduce(function(sequence, chapterUrl) {  // Add these actions to the end of the sequence  return sequence.then(function() {    return getJSON(chapterUrl);  }).then(function(chapter) {    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });}, Promise.resolve())\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is doing the same as the previous example, but doesn't need the separate \"sequence\" variable. Our reduce callback is called for each item in the array. \"sequence\" is <code>Promise.resolve()</code> the first time around, but for the rest of the calls \"sequence\" is whatever we returned from the previous call. <code>array.reduce</code> is really useful for boiling an array down to a single value, which in this case is a promise.</p>\n<p>Let's put it all together:</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);  return story.chapterUrls.reduce(function(sequence, chapterUrl) {    // Once the last chapter's promise is done...    return sequence.then(function() {      // ...fetch the next chapter      return getJSON(chapterUrl);    }).then(function(chapter) {      // and add it to the page      addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);    });  }, Promise.resolve());}).then(function() {  // And we're all done!  addTextToPage(\"All done\");}).catch(function(err) {  // Catch any error that happened along the way  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);}).then(function() {  // Always hide the spinner  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>And there we have it, a fully async version of the sync version. But we can do better. At the moment our page is downloading like this:</p>\n<p>Browsers are pretty good at downloading multiple things at once, so we're losing performance by downloading chapters one after the other. What we want to do is download them all at the same time, then process them when they've all arrived. Thankfully there's an API for this:</p>\n<pre><code>Promise.all(arrayOfPromises).then(function(arrayOfResults) {  //...})\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Promise.all</code> takes an array of promises and creates a promise that fulfills when all of them successfully complete. You get an array of results (whatever the promises fulfilled to) in the same order as the promises you passed in.</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);  // Take an array of promises and wait on them all  return Promise.all(    // Map our array of chapter urls to    // an array of chapter json promises    story.chapterUrls.map(getJSON)  );}).then(function(chapters) {  // Now we have the chapters jsons in order! Loop through...  chapters.forEach(function(chapter) {    // ...and add to the page    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);  });  addTextToPage(\"All done\");}).catch(function(err) {  // catch any error that happened so far  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);}).then(function() {  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>\n<p>Depending on connection, this can be seconds faster than loading one-by-one, and it's less code than our first try. The chapters can download in whatever order, but they appear on screen in the right order.</p>\n<p>However, we can still improve perceived performance. When chapter one arrives we should add it to the page. This lets the user start reading before the rest of the chapters have arrived. When chapter three arrives, we wouldn't add it to the page because the user may not realize chapter two is missing. When chapter two arrives, we can add chapters two and three, etc etc.</p>\n<p>To do this, we fetch JSON for all our chapters at the same time, then create a sequence to add them to the document:</p>\n<pre><code>getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);  // Map our array of chapter urls to  // an array of chapter json promises.  // This makes sure they all download in parallel.  return story.chapterUrls.map(getJSON)    .reduce(function(sequence, chapterPromise) {      // Use reduce to chain the promises together,      // adding content to the page for each chapter      return sequence      .then(function() {        // Wait for everything in the sequence so far,        // then wait for this chapter to arrive.        return chapterPromise;      }).then(function(chapter) {        addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);      });    }, Promise.resolve());}).then(function() {  addTextToPage(\"All done\");}).catch(function(err) {  // catch any error that happened along the way  addTextToPage(\"Argh, broken: \" + err.message);}).then(function() {  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';})\n</code></pre>"},{"url":"/docs/javascript/review/","relativePath":"docs/javascript/review.md","relativeDir":"docs/javascript","base":"review.md","name":"review","frontmatter":{"title":"Javascript Concepts Review","weight":0,"excerpt":"Javascript Concepts Review","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>Core Concept Review</h2>\n<h1>Core Concepts</h1>\n<h1>index</h1>\n<p>This appendix is a non-exhaustive list of new syntactic features and methods that were added to JavaScript in ES6. These features are the most commonly used and most helpful.</p>\n<p>While this appendix doesn't cover ES6 classes, we go over the basics while learning about components in the book. In addition, this appendix doesn't include descriptions of some larger new features like promises and generators. If you'd like more info on those or on any topic below, we encourage you to reference the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla Developer Network's website</a> (MDN).</p>\n<h2>Prefer <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> over <code>var</code></h2>\n<p>If you've worked with ES5 JavaScript before, you're likely used to seeing variables declared with <code>var</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">ar myVariable = 5;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both the <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> statements also declare variables. They were introduced in ES6.</p>\n<p>Use <code>const</code> in cases where a variable is never re-assigned. Using <code>const</code> makes this clear to whoever is reading your code. It refers to the \"constant\" state of the variable in the context it is defined within.</p>\n<p>If the variable will be re-assigned, use <code>let</code>.</p>\n<p>We encourage the use of <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> instead of <code>var</code>. In addition to the restriction introduced by <code>const</code>, both <code>const</code> and <code>let</code> are <em>block scoped</em> as opposed to <em>function scoped</em>. This scoping can help avoid unexpected bugs.</p>\n<h2>Arrow functions</h2>\n<p>There are three ways to write arrow function bodies. For the examples below, let's say we have an array of city objects:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">onst cities = [\n  { name: 'Cairo', pop: 7764700 },\n  { name: 'Lagos', pop: 8029200 },\n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we write an arrow function that spans multiple lines, we must use braces to delimit the function body like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const formattedPopulations = cities.map((city) => {\n    const popMM = (city.pop / 1000000).toFixed(2);\n    return popMM + ' million';\n});\nconsole.log(formattedPopulations);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that we must also explicitly specify a <code>return</code> for the function.</p>\n<p>However, if we write a function body that is only a single line (or single expression) we can use parentheses to delimit it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const formattedPopulations2 = cities.map((city) => (city.pop / 1000000).toFixed(2) + ' million');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notably, we don't use <code>return</code> as it's implied.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if your function body is terse you can write it like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const pops = cities.map((city) => city.pop);\nconsole.log(pops);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The terseness of arrow functions is one of two reasons that we use them. Compare the one-liner above to this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const popsNoArrow = cities.map(function (city) {\n    return city.pop;\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of greater benefit, though, is how arrow functions bind the <code>this</code> object.</p>\n<p>The traditional JavaScript function declaration syntax (<code>function () {}</code>) will bind <code>this</code> in anonymous functions to the global object. To illustrate the confusion this causes, consider the following example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">unction printSong() {\n  console.log(\"Oops - The Global Object\");\n}\n\nconst jukebox = {\n  songs: [\n    {\n      title: \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\",\n      artist: \"Michael Jackson\",\n    },\n    {\n      title: \"Superstar\",\n      artist: \"Madonna\",\n    },\n  ],\n  printSong: function (song) {\n    console.log(song.title + \" - \" + song.artist);\n  },\n  printSongs: function () {\n\n    this.songs.forEach(function(song) {\n\n      this.printSong(song);\n    });\n  },\n}\n\njukebox.printSongs();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The method <code>printSongs()</code> iterates over <code>this.songs</code> with <code>forEach()</code>. In this context, <code>this</code> is bound to the object (<code>jukebox</code>) as expected. However, the anonymous function passed to <code>forEach()</code> binds its internal <code>this</code> to the global object. As such, <code>this.printSong(song)</code> calls the function declared at the top of the example, <em>not</em> the method on <code>jukebox</code>.</p>\n<p>JavaScript developers have traditionally used workarounds for this behavior, but arrow functions solve the problem by <strong>capturing the <code>this</code> value of the enclosing context</strong>. Using an arrow function for <code>printSongs()</code> has the expected result:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">  printSongs: function () {\n    this.songs.forEach((song) => {\n\n      this.printSong(song);\n    });\n  },\n}\n\njukebox.printSongs();\n</code></pre>\n<p>For this reason, throughout the book we use arrow functions for all anonymous functions.</p>\n<h2>Modules</h2>\n<p>ES6 formally supports modules using the <code>import</code>/<code>export</code> syntax.</p>\n<p><strong>Named exports</strong></p>\n<p>Inside any file, you can use <code>export</code> to specify a variable the module should expose. Here's an example of a file that exports two functions:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export const sayHi = () => console.log('Hi!');\nexport const sayBye = () => console.log('Bye!');\n\nconst saySomething = () => console.log('Something!');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, anywhere we wanted to use these functions we could use <code>import</code>. We need to specify which functions we want to import. A common way of doing this is using ES6's destructuring assignment syntax to list them out like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import { sayHi, sayBye } from './greetings';\n\nsayHi();\nsayBye();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Importantly, the function that was <em>not</em> exported (<code>saySomething</code>) is unavailable outside of the module.</p>\n<p>Also note that we supply a <strong>relative path</strong> to <code>from</code>, indicating that the ES6 module is a local file as opposed to an npm package.</p>\n<p>Instead of inserting an <code>export</code> before each variable you'd like to export, you can use this syntax to list off all the exposed variables in one area:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const sayHi = () => console.log('Hi!');\nconst sayBye = () => console.log('Bye!');\n\nconst saySomething = () => console.log('Something!');\n\nexport { sayHi, sayBye };\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can also specify that we'd like to import all of a module's functionality underneath a given namespace with the <code>import * as &#x3C;Namespace></code> syntax:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import * as Greetings from './greetings';\n\nGreetings.sayHi();\n\nGreetings.sayBye();\n\nGreetings.saySomething();\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Default export</strong></p>\n<p>The other type of export is a default export. A module can only contain one default export:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const sayHi = () => console.log('Hi!');\nconst sayBye = () => console.log('Bye!');\n\nconst saySomething = () => console.log('Something!');\n\nconst Greetings = { sayHi, sayBye };\n\nexport default Greetings;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a common pattern for libraries. It means you can easily import the library wholesale without specifying what individual functions you want:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import Greetings from './greetings';\n\nGreetings.sayHi();\nGreetings.sayBye();\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's not uncommon for a module to use a mix of both named exports and default exports. For instance, with <code>react-dom</code>, you can import <code>ReactDOM</code> (a default export) like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\nReactDOM.render();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, if you're only going to use the <code>render()</code> function, you can import the named <code>render()</code> function like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">import { render } from 'react-dom';\n\nrender();\n</code></pre>\n<p>To achieve this flexibility, the export implementation for <code>react-dom</code> looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">export const render = (component, target) => {};\n\nconst ReactDOM = {\n    render\n};\n\nexport default ReactDOM;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you want to play around with the module syntax, check out the folder <code>code/webpack/es6-modules</code>.</p>\n<p>For more reading on ES6 modules, see this article from Mozilla: \"<a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/\">ES6 in Depth: Modules</a>\".</p>\n<h2><code>Object.assign()</code></h2>\n<p>We use <code>Object.assign()</code> often throughout the book. We use it in areas where we want to create a modified version of an existing object.</p>\n<p><code>Object.assign()</code> accepts any number of objects as arguments. When the function receives two arguments, it <em>copies</em> the properties of the second object onto the first, like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">onst coffee = { };\nconst noCream = { cream: false };\nconst noMilk = { milk: false };\nObject.assign(coffee, noCream);\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is idiomatic to pass in three arguments to <code>Object.assign()</code>. The first argument is a new JavaScript object, the one that <code>Object.assign()</code> will ultimately return. The second is the object whose properties we'd like to build off of. The last is the changes we'd like to apply:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const coffeeWithMilk = Object.assign({}, coffee, { milk: true });\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Object.assign()</code> is a handy method for working with \"immutable\" JavaScript objects.</p>\n<h2>Template literals</h2>\n<p>In ES5 JavaScript, you'd interpolate variables into strings like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var greeting = 'Hello, ' + user + '! It is ' + degF + ' degrees outside.';\n</code></pre>\n<p>With ES6 template literals, we can create the same string like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const greeting = `Hello, ${user}! It is ${degF} degrees outside.`;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>The spread operator (<code>...</code>)</h2>\n<p>In arrays, the ellipsis <code>...</code> operator will <em>expand</em> the array that follows into the parent array. The spread operator enables us to succinctly construct new arrays as a composite of existing arrays.</p>\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">onst a = [ 1, 2, 3 ];\nconst b = [ 4, 5, 6 ];\nconst c = [ ...a, ...b, 7, 8, 9 ];\n\nconsole.log(c);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how this is different than if we wrote:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const d = [a, b, 7, 8, 9];\nconsole.log(d);\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Enhanced object literals</h2>\n<p>In ES5, all objects were required to have explicit key and value declarations:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const explicit = {\n    getState: getState,\n    dispatch: dispatch\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In ES6, you can use this terser syntax whenever the property name and variable name are the same:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const implicit = {\n    getState,\n    dispatch\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lots of open source libraries use this syntax, so it's good to be familiar with it. But whether you use it in your own code is a matter of stylistic preference.</p>\n<h2>Default arguments</h2>\n<p>With ES6, you can specify a default value for an argument in the case that it is <code>undefined</code> when the function is called.</p>\n<p>This:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">unction divide(a, b) {\n\n  const divisor = typeof b === 'undefined' ? 1 : b;\n\n  return a / divisor;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Can be written as this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function divide(a, b = 1) {\n    return a / b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In both cases, using the function looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">divide(14, 2);\n\ndivide(14, undefined);\n\ndivide(14);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whenever the argument <code>b</code> in the example above is <code>undefined</code>, the default argument is used. Note that <code>null</code> will not use the default argument:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">divide(14, null);\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Destructuring assignments</h2>\n<h3>For arrays</h3>\n<p>In ES5, extracting and assigning multiple elements from an array looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">ar fruits = [ 'apples', 'bananas', 'oranges' ];\nvar fruit1 = fruits[0];\nvar fruit2 = fruits[1];\n</code></pre>\n<p>In ES6, we can use the destructuring syntax to accomplish the same task like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const [veg1, veg2] = ['asparagus', 'broccoli', 'onion'];\nconsole.log(veg1);\nconsole.log(veg2);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The variables in the array on the left are \"matched\" and assigned to the corresponding elements in the array on the right. Note that <code>'onion'</code> is ignored and has no variable bound to it.</p>\n<h3>For objects</h3>\n<p>We can do something similar for extracting object properties into variables:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const smoothie = {\n    fats: ['avocado', 'peanut butter', 'greek yogurt'],\n    liquids: ['almond milk'],\n    greens: ['spinach'],\n    fruits: ['blueberry', 'banana']\n};\n\nconst { liquids, fruits } = smoothie;\n\nconsole.log(liquids);\nconsole.log(fruits);\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Parameter context matching</h3>\n<p>We can use these same principles to bind arguments inside a function to properties of an object supplied as an argument:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const containsSpinach = ({ greens }) => {\n    if (greens.find((g) => g === 'spinach')) {\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        return false;\n    }\n};\n\ncontainsSpinach(smoothie);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We do this often with functional React components:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">const IngredientList = ({ ingredients, onClick }) => (\n    &#x3C;ul className=\"IngredientList\">\n        {ingredients.map((i) => (\n            &#x3C;li key={i.id} onClick={() => onClick(i.id)} className=\"item\">\n                {i.name}\n            &#x3C;/li>\n        ))}\n    &#x3C;/ul>\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we use destructuring to extract the props into variables (<code>ingredients</code> and <code>onClick</code>) that we then use inside the component's function body.</p>\n<p>Share To Linkedin:</p>"},{"url":"/docs/javascript/this-is-about-this/","relativePath":"docs/javascript/this-is-about-this.md","relativeDir":"docs/javascript","base":"this-is-about-this.md","name":"this-is-about-this","frontmatter":{"title":"WhatisTHIS","weight":0,"excerpt":"Arrow functions are great because the inner value of this cant be changed, its *always* the same as the outer this.","seo":{"title":"This in JavaScript","description":"Arrow functions are great because the inner value of this cant be changed, its *always* the same as the outer this.","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>What is THIS</h1>\n<h2>If the function is defined as an arrow function: <a href=\"https://web.dev/javascript-this/#arrow-functions\">#</a></h2>\n<pre><code>const arrowFunction = () => {  console.log(this);};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, the value of <code>this</code> is <em>always</em> the same as <code>this</code> in the parent scope:</p>\n<pre><code>const outerThis = this;const arrowFunction = () => {  // Always logs `true`:  console.log(this === outerThis);};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Arrow functions are great because the inner value of <code>this</code> can't be changed, it's <em>always</em> the same as the outer <code>this</code>.</p>\n<h3>Other examples <a href=\"https://web.dev/javascript-this/#other-examples\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With arrow functions, the value of <code>this</code> <em>can't</em> be changed with <a href=\"https://web.dev/javascript-this/#bound\"><code>bind</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Logs `true` - bound `this` value is ignored:arrowFunction.bind({foo: 'bar'})();\n</code></pre>\n<p>With arrow functions, the value of <code>this</code> <em>can't</em> be changed with <a href=\"https://web.dev/javascript-this/#call-apply\"><code>call</code> or <code>apply</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Logs `true` - called `this` value is ignored:arrowFunction.call({foo: 'bar'});// Logs `true` - applied `this` value is ignored:arrowFunction.apply({foo: 'bar'});\n</code></pre>\n<p>With arrow functions, the value of <code>this</code> <em>can't</em> be changed by calling the function as a member of another object:</p>\n<pre><code>const obj = {arrowFunction};// Logs `true` - parent object is ignored:obj.arrowFunction();\n</code></pre>\n<p>With arrow functions, the value of <code>this</code> <em>can't</em> be changed by calling the function as a constructor:</p>\n<pre><code>// TypeError: arrowFunction is not a constructornew arrowFunction();\n</code></pre>\n<h3>'Bound' instance methods <a href=\"https://web.dev/javascript-this/#&#x27;bound&#x27;-instance-methods\">#</a></h3>\n<p>With instance methods, if you want to ensure <code>this</code> always refers to the class instance, the best way is to use arrow functions and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields\">class fields</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>class Whatever {  someMethod = () => {    // Always the instance of Whatever:    console.log(this);  };}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This pattern is really useful when using instance methods as event listeners in components (such as React components, or web components).</p>\n<p>The above might feel like it's breaking the \"<code>this</code> will be the same as <code>this</code> in the parent scope\" rule, but it starts to make sense if you think of class fields as syntactic sugar for setting things in the constructor:</p>\n<pre><code>class Whatever {  someMethod = (() => {    const outerThis = this;    return () => {      // Always logs `true`:      console.log(this === outerThis);    };  })();}// ...is roughly equivalent to:class Whatever {  constructor() {    const outerThis = this;    this.someMethod = () => {      // Always logs `true`:      console.log(this === outerThis);    };  }}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternative pattens involve binding an existing function in the constructor, or assigning the function in the constructor. If you can't use class fields for some reason, assigning functions in the constructor is a reasonable alternative:</p>\n<pre><code>class Whatever {  constructor() {    this.someMethod = () => {      // ...    };  }}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Otherwise, if the function/class is called with <code>new</code>: <a href=\"https://web.dev/javascript-this/#new\">#</a></h2>\n<pre><code>new Whatever();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above will call <code>Whatever</code> (or its constructor function if it's a class) with <code>this</code> set to the result of <code>Object.create(Whatever.prototype)</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>class MyClass {  constructor() {    console.log(      this.constructor === Object.create(MyClass.prototype).constructor,    );  }}// Logs `true`:new MyClass();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The same is true for older-style constructors:</p>\n<pre><code>function MyClass() {  console.log(    this.constructor === Object.create(MyClass.prototype).constructor,  );}// Logs `true`:new MyClass();\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Other examples <a href=\"https://web.dev/javascript-this/#other-examples-2\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When called with <code>new</code>, the value of <code>this</code> <em>can't</em> be changed with <a href=\"https://web.dev/javascript-this/#bound\"><code>bind</code></a>:</p>\n<pre><code>const BoundMyClass = MyClass.bind({foo: 'bar'});// Logs `true` - bound `this` value is ignored:new BoundMyClass();\n</code></pre>\n<p>When called with <code>new</code>, the value of <code>this</code> <em>can't</em> be changed by calling the function as a member of another object:</p>\n<pre><code>const obj = {MyClass};// Logs `true` - parent object is ignored:new obj.MyClass();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Otherwise, if the function has a 'bound' <code>this</code> value: <a href=\"https://web.dev/javascript-this/#bound\">#</a></h2>\n<pre><code>function someFunction() {  return this;}const boundObject = {hello: 'world'};const boundFunction = someFunction.bind(boundObject);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whenever <code>boundFunction</code> is called, its <code>this</code> value will be the object passed to <code>bind</code> (<code>boundObject</code>).</p>\n<pre><code>// Logs `false`:console.log(someFunction() === boundObject);// Logs `true`:console.log(boundFunction() === boundObject);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Warning: Avoid using <code>bind</code> to bind a function to its outer <code>this</code>.

(If you don't know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>13</code> is a divisor of <code>26</code> because <code>26 / 13</code> has no remainder.)</p>\n<h3>Problem 5</h3>\n<p>Take two lists, and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are <code>common between the lists (without duplicates)</code>.

Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint:</strong><br>\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence.

Some of the obvious advantages are that they are free, easy to access, and easy to share. Moreover, Google spreadsheets can be especially powerful because of their ability to connect with tools like <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a> or <a href=\"https://phantombuster.com/\">Phantombuster</a> that can create automated workflows between a plethora of different online applications.</p>\n<p>Although these kinds of tools usually offer functionalities to automatically manipulate Google spreadsheets as well, I've experienced a lack of flexibility on how to update your spreadsheets. A customized Python script can offer way more flexibility and possibilities.</p>\n<p>To update your Google spreadsheets with Python, you can use the Google sheets API. Google offers free API access to several of their workspace apps, like Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Sheets. You can check out their API library <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?project=cellular-axon-327013\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Below I'll walk you through the steps to set up the Google Sheets API with Python and show a couple of basic examples of how to manipulate spreadsheets using the API.</p>\n<h1>Setting Up the API</h1>\n<h2>Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Platform project</h2>\n<p>To get started with any of the Google workspace APIs, you need to have a so-called Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. A GCP project forms the basis for all of Google's cloud computing services, including their API library. Setting up a project and using the APIs is completely free. Follow the steps outlined <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project\">here</a> to create your GCP project. It should be pretty straightforward.</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Create Credentials</h2>\n<p>After creating a GCP project (step 1), we need to set up our credentials for accessing the API. Our credentials are like a key for the API to know who is requesting access to its data and services. You can follow the steps listed <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials\">here</a> to <em>create desktop application credentials</em>. In my experience, some steps were missing in this tutorial, so I'm giving the detailed version below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start by navigating back to your <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard\">Google Cloud Console</a>.</li>\n<li>Find the <em>APIs &#x26; Services</em> tab, and then select the <em>Credentials</em> page</li>\n<li>Click on *+Create Credentials *and select <em>OAuth client ID</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<!---->\n<ul>\n<li>Select <em>Desktop app</em> as the application type and give your app a name. Then click create.</li>\n<li>You will be prompted to set up your OAuth consent screen. Follow the steps you are prompted with and make sure to add yourself as a test user.</li>\n<li>After generating your client ID, you will be able to see it on your credentials page.</li>\n<li>Click the download button to download a JSON file with your credentials. Rename it to <em>credentials.json</em>. You will need this in the next step.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Step 3: Set up the API</h2>\n<p>After creating a GCP project and generating your credentials, it is time to connect to the API with Python for the first time. You can follow the steps outlined <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python\">here</a>. The steps given on the Google developers page are pretty self-explanatory. Three things I want to add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to have a look at the prerequisites before diving in.</li>\n<li>Don't forget to move your <em>credentials.json</em> file to the same folder where your <em>quickstart.py</em> file is.</li>\n<li>Change the URL in the SCOPE list in the quickstart script to <em><a href=\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets\">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets</a></em> to make sure that you have both read and write access.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If everything goes as expected, you should see this in your browser after running the sample script:</p>\n<p>After successfully running the sample, you will also find a <em>token.json</em> file in your workspace. This file is used for authentication on any of your future calls to the API. You're now ready to use the API!</p>\n<h1>Using the API</h1>\n<p>Now that we have set up the API connection, we can use the API to create, read, and edit Google spreadsheets! Extensive documentation on how to use the API can be found <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/create#python\">here</a>. I'll run through a few basic examples below.</p>\n<h2>Reading from an existing spreadsheet</h2>\n<p>Reading from an existing spreadsheet is a key functionality if you want to automate your spreadsheets. Let's create a new spreadsheet in the Google workspace and input some data. Below is a screenshot of the table I created.</p>\n<p>The API identifies spreadsheets using a spreadsheet ID. To connect to a spreadsheet that already exists, you can find the spreadsheet ID in the Google Sheets URL as follows:</p>\n<p>After identifying the spreadsheet ID of the spreadsheet we just created, we can use the API to connect to the spreadsheet and to read its data. Below is a code example of how to do this. The main functionalities to retrieve data from an existing spreadsheet are provided by sheet.values().get().execute()* <em>on line 17</em>. *Note that this is where we pass the spreadsheet ID and the range of values in the sheet we want to retrieve. All code before that establishes the connection to the API and is very similar to the <em>quickstart.py</em> file we used to connect to the API for the first time.</p>\n<p>The code returns a list of lists containing the data of our spreadsheet. Note that the data is returned row-by-row this way.</p>\n<h2>Writing to an existing spreadsheet</h2>\n<p>Next, let's try to add a new value to the spreadsheet. After all, this is the second key bit we need to automatically update our spreadsheets.</p>\n<p>The code below shows how to add a row to the existing data with the values [6, f]. Similar to reading values from an existing sheet, we need to start with establishing the connection to the API and identifying the spreadsheet ID. Because we are now writing new data to the spreadsheet, it is essential to make sure that you have not specified read-only permission in your SCOPES list (line 5).</p>\n<p>The main functionalities to append new data to an existing spreadsheet are provided by *sheet.values().append().execute() <em>on lines 17–22</em>. *Note that this is where we pass the spreadsheet ID, spreadsheet range, and several other parameters that specify how the data has to be inserted and what data has to be inserted. The <em>body</em> parameter takes a dictionary with values to append to the existing data table, using the same list-of-list format we saw before.</p>\n<p>After running the code, the spreadsheet is automatically updated with our new entry. The new row is neatly appended to the data that we manually wrote in the spreadsheet.</p>\n<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>\n<p>The Google workspace API library is a really powerful and relatively user-friendly way to automate workflows related to any of the Google workspace applications. In this tutorial, I walked you through setting up the Google Sheets API with Python and showed a few examples of how to manipulate spreadsheets using this API. The possibilities of how to use this are endless.</p>\n<p>Setting up access to the other APIs involves a very similar process and would allow for even more elaborate and complex automation flows.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/python/","relativePath":"docs/python/index.md","relativeDir":"docs/python","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Python","weight":0,"excerpt":"Python","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<br>\n<h1>  Python Resources</h1>\n<br>\n<iframe class=\"inner\" src=\"https://ds-unit-5-lambda.netlify.app/\" height=\"1000px\" width=\"1400px\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"  frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h2>My Python Docs:</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://bgoonz42.gitbook.io/datastructures-in-pytho/\">My Python Website</a></h2>\n<h1>Python Study Guide for a JavaScript Programmer</h1>\n<p>A guide to commands in Python from what you know in JavaScript</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Python Study Guide for a JavaScript Programmer</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3V9VOfPk_hrFdbEAd3j-QQ.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>### Applications of Tutorial & Cheat Sheet Respectivley (At Bottom Of Tutorial):\n<h3>Basics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"f893\"><strong>PEP8</strong> : Python Enhancement Proposals, style-guide for Python.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"c0bf\"><code>print</code> is the equivalent of <code>console.log</code>.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'print() == console.log()'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><code>#</code> is used to make comments in your code.</h3>\n<pre><code>def foo():\n    \"\"\"\n    The foo function does many amazing things that you\n    should not question.

The total number of spaces preceding the first non-blank character then determines the line's indentation. Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical lines using backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash determines the indentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-platform compatibility note:</strong> because of the nature of text editors on non-UNIX platforms, it is unwise to use a mixture of spaces and tabs for the indentation in a single source file.</p>\n<p>A formfeed character may be present at the start of the line; it will be ignored for the indentation calculations above. Formfeed characters occurring elsewhere in the leading whitespace have an undefined effect (for instance, they may reset the space count to zero).</p>\n<p>The indentation levels of consecutive lines are used to generate INDENT and DEDENT tokens, using a stack, as follows.</p>\n<p>Before the first line of the file is read, a single zero is pushed on the stack; this will never be popped off again. The numbers pushed on the stack will always be strictly increasing from bottom to top. At the beginning of each logical line, the line's indentation level is compared to the top of the stack. If it is equal, nothing happens. If it is larger, it is pushed on the stack, and one INDENT token is generated. If it is smaller, it must be one of the numbers occurring on the stack; all numbers on the stack that are larger are popped off, and for each number popped off a DEDENT token is generated.

can run:</p>\n<h3><code>yarn start</code></h3>\n<p>Runs the app in the development mode.<br>\nOpen <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a> to view it in the browser.</p>\n<p>The page will reload if you make edits.<br>\nYou will also see any lint errors in the console.</p>\n<h3><code>yarn test</code></h3>\n<p>Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>\nSee the section about <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests\">running tests</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3><code>yarn build</code></h3>\n<p>Builds the app for production to the <code>build</code> folder.<br>\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.</p>\n<p>The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>\nYour app is ready to be deployed!</p>\n<p>See the section about <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment\">deployment</a> for more information.</p>\n<h3><code>yarn eject</code></h3>\n<p><strong>Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you <code>eject</code>, you can't go back!</strong></p>\n<p>If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can <code>eject</code> at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.</p>\n<p>Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except <code>eject</code> will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.</p>\n<p>You don't have to ever use <code>eject</code>. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.</p>\n<h2>Learn More</h2>\n<p>You can learn more in the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started\">Create React App documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>To learn React, check out the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React documentation</a>.</p>\n<h3>Code Splitting</h3>\n<p>This section has moved here: <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting\">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting</a></p>\n<h3>Analyzing the Bundle Size</h3>\n<p>This section has moved here: <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size\">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size</a></p>\n<h3>Making a Progressive Web App</h3>\n<p>This section has moved here: <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app\">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app</a></p>\n<h3>Advanced Configuration</h3>\n<p>This section has moved here: <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration\">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration</a></p>\n<h3>Deployment</h3>\n<p>This section has moved here: <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment\">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment</a></p>\n<h3><code>yarn build</code> fails to minify</h3>\n<p>This section has moved here: <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify\">https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify</a></p>"},{"url":"/docs/quick-reference/git-bash/","relativePath":"docs/quick-reference/git-bash.md","relativeDir":"docs/quick-reference","base":"git-bash.md","name":"git-bash","frontmatter":{"title":"Git Bash","weight":0,"excerpt":"Git Bash","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>Git Bash‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌\n\n</h1>\n<p>At its core, Git is a set of command line utility programs that are designed to execute on a Unix style command-line environment. Modern operating systems like Linux and macOS both include built-in Unix command line terminals. This makes Linux and macOS complementary operating systems when working with Git. Microsoft Windows instead uses Windows command prompt, a non-Unix terminal environment.</p>\n<p>In Windows environments, Git is often packaged as part of higher level GUI applications. GUIs for Git may attempt to abstract and hide the underlying version control system primitives. This can be a great aid for Git beginners to rapidly contribute to a project. Once a project's collaboration requirements grow with other team members, it is critical to be aware of how the actual raw Git methods work. This is when it can be beneficial to drop a GUI version for the command line tools. Git Bash is offered to provide a terminal Git experience.</p>\n<h2>What is Git Bash?</h2>\n<p>Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience. Bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell. A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system through written commands. Bash is a popular default shell on Linux and macOS. Git Bash is a package that installs Bash, some common bash utilities, and Git on a Windows operating system.</p>\n<h2>How to install Git Bash</h2>\n<p>Git Bash comes included as part of the <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\">Git For Windows</a> package. Download and install Git For Windows like other Windows applications. Once downloaded find the included .exe file and open to execute Git Bash.</p>\n<h2>How to use Git Bash</h2>\n<p>Git Bash has the same operations as a standard Bash experience. It will be helpful to review basic Bash usage. Advanced usage of Bash is outside the scope of this Git focused document.</p>\n<h2>How to navigate folders</h2>\n<p>The Bash command pwd is used to print the 'present working directory'. pwd is equivalent to executing cd on a DOS(Windows console host) terminal. This is the folder or path that the current Bash session resides in.</p>\n<p>The Bash command ls is used to 'list' contents of the current working directory. ls is equivalent to DIR on a Windows console host terminal.</p>\n<p>Both Bash and Windows console host have a cd command. cd is an acronym for 'Change Directory'. cd is invoked with an appended directory name. Executing cd will change the terminal sessions current working directory to the passed directory argument.</p>\n<h2>Git Bash Commands</h2>\n<p>Git Bash is packaged with additional commands that can be found in the /usr/bin directory of the Git Bash emulation. Git Bash can actually provide a fairly robust shell experience on Windows. Git Bash comes packaged with the following shell commands which are outside the scope of this document: <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1\">Ssh</a>, <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp\">scp</a>, <a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html\">cat</a>, <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/find\">find</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition the previously discussed set of Bash commands, Git Bash includes the full set of Git core commands discussed through out this site.

When you register your app with Firebase, you'll get a Firebase configuration object that you'll use to connect your app with your Firebase project resources.</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more\">Understand Firebase Projects</a> to learn more about Firebase projects and best practices for adding apps to projects.</p>\n<p>If you don't already have a JavaScript project and just want to try out a Firebase product, you can download one of our <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/samples\">quickstart samples</a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 2</strong>: Install the SDK and initialize Firebase</h2>\n<p>This page describes setup instructions for version 9 of the Firebase JS SDK, which uses a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules\">JavaScript Module</a> format.</p>\n<p>This workflow uses npm and requires module bundlers or JavaScript framework tooling because the v9 SDK is optimized to work with <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/module-bundling\">module bundlers</a> to eliminate unused code (tree-shaking) and decrease SDK size.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install Firebase using npm:</li>\n<li>\n<p>Initialize Firebase in your app and create a Firebase App object:</p>\n<p>A Firebase App is a container-like object that stores common configuration and shares authentication across Firebase services. After you initialize a Firebase App object in your code, you can add and start using Firebase services.</p>\n<p>Do you use ESM and want to use browser modules? Replace all your</p>\n<p><strong>import</strong></p>\n<p>lines to use the following pattern:</p>\n<p><strong>import { } from '<a href=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.0.2/firebase-SERVICE.js\">https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.0.2/firebase-SERVICE.js</a>'</strong></p>\n<p>(where</p>\n<p><strong>SERVICE</strong></p>\n<p>is an SDK name such as</p>\n<p><strong>firebase-firestore</strong></p>\n<p>).</p>\n<p>Using browser modules is a quick way to get started, but we recommend using a module bundler for production.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Step 3</strong>: Access Firebase in your app</h2>\n<p>Firebase services (like Cloud Firestore, Authentication, Realtime Database, Remote Config, and more) are available to import within individual sub-packages.</p>\n<p>The example below shows how you could use the Cloud Firestore Lite SDK to retrieve a list of data.</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 4</strong>: Use a module bundler (webpack/Rollup) for size reduction</h2>\n<p>The Firebase Web SDK is designed to work with module bundlers to remove any unused code (tree-shaking).

You need to do this so that the Node.js (and later Python) programs running on your Ubuntu installation can access the PostgreSQL server running on your Windows installation. You need to tell <code>apt</code>, the package manager, that you want it to go find the PostgreSQL 12 client tools from PostgreSQL itself rather than the common package repositories. You do that by issuing the following two commands. Copy and paste them one at a time into your shell. (If your Ubuntu shell isn't running, start one.)</p>\n<p><strong>Pro-tip</strong>: Copy those commands because you're not going to type them, right? After you copy one of them, you can just right-click on the Ubuntu shell. That should paste them in there for you.</p>\n<pre><code>wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -\n</code></pre>\n<p>If prompted for your password, type it.</p>\n<pre><code>echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main\" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list\n</code></pre>\n<p>The last line of output of those two commands running should read “OK”. If it does not, try copying and pasting them one at a time.</p>\n<p>Now that you've registered the PostgreSQL repositories as a source to look for PostgreSQL, you need to update the <code>apt</code> registry. You should do this before you install <em>any</em> software on Ubuntu.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt update\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once that's finished running, the new entries for PostgreSQL 12 should be in the repository. Now, you can install them with the following command.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt install postgresql-client-12 postgresql-common\n</code></pre>\n<p>If it asks you if you want to install them, please tell it “Y”.</p>\n<p>Test that it installed by typing <code>psql --version</code>. You should see it print out information about the version of the installed tools. If it tells you that it can't find the command, try these instructions over.</p>\n<h3>Configuring the client tools</h3>\n<p>Since you're going to be accessing the PosgreSQL installation from your Ubuntu installation on your Windows installation, you're going to have to type that you want to access it over and over, which means extra typing. To prevent you from having to do this, you can customize your shell to always add the extra commands for you.</p>\n<p>This assumes you're still using Bash. If you changed the shell that your Ubuntu installation uses, please follow that shell's directions for adding an alias to its startup file.</p>\n<p>Make sure you're in your Ubuntu home directory. You can do that by typing <code>cd</code> and hitting enter. Use <code>ls</code> to find out if you have a <code>.bashrc</code> file. Type <code>ls .bashrc</code>. If it shows you that one exists, that's the one you will add the alias to. If it tells you that there is no file named that, then type <code>ls .profile</code>. If it shows you that one exists, that's the one you will add the alias to. If it shows you that it does not exist, then use the file name <code>.bashrc</code> in the following section.</p>\n<p>Now that you know which profile file to use, type <code>code «profile file name»</code> where \"profile file name\" is the name of the file you determined from the last section. Once Visual Studio Code starts up with your file, at the end of it (or if you've already added aliases, in that section), type the following.</p>\n<pre><code>alias psql=\"psql -h localhost\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you run <code>psql</code> from the command line, it will now always add the part about wanting to connect to <em>localhost</em> every time. You would have to type that each time, otherwise.</p>\n<p>To make sure that you set that up correctly, type <code>psql -U postgres postgres</code>. This tells the <code>psql</code> client that you want to connect as the user \"postgres\" (<code>-U postgres</code>) to the database postgres (<code>postgres</code> at the end), which is the default database created when PostgreSQL is installed. It will prompt you for a password. Type the password that you used when you installed PostgrSQL, earlier. If the alias works correctly and you type the correct password, then you should see something like the following output.</p>\n<pre><code>psql (12.2 (Ubuntu 12.2-2.pgdg18.04+1))\nType \"help\" for help.\n\npostgres=#\n</code></pre>\n<p>Type <code>\\q</code> and hit Enter to exit the PostgreSQL client tool.</p>\n<p>Now, you will add a user for your Ubuntu identity so that you don't have to specify it all the time. Then, you will create a file that PostgreSQL will use to automatically send your password every time.</p>\n<p>Copy and paste the following into your Ubuntu shell. Think of a password that you want to use for your user. <strong>Replace the password in the single quotes in the command with the password that you want.</strong> It <em>has</em> to be a non-empty string. PostgreSQL doesn't like it when it's not.</p>\n<pre><code>psql -U postgres -c \"CREATE USER `whoami` WITH PASSWORD 'password' SUPERUSER\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>It should prompt you for a password. Type the password that you created when you installed PostgreSQL. Once you type the correct password, you should see “CREATE ROLE”.</p>\n<p>Now you will create your PostgreSQL password file. Type the following into your Ubuntu shell to open Visual Studio Code and create a new file.</p>\n<pre><code>code ~/.pgpass\n</code></pre>\n<p>In that file, you will add this line, which tells it that on localhost for port 5432 (where PostgreSQL is running), for all databases (*), <strong>use your Ubuntu user name and the password that you just created for that user with the</strong> <code>psql</code> <strong>command you just typed.</strong> (If you have forgotten your Ubuntu user name, type <code>whoami</code> on the command line.) Your entry in the file should have this format.</p>\n<pre><code>localhost:5432:*:«your Ubuntu user name»:«the password you just used»\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once you have that information in the file, save it, and close Visual Studio Code.</p>\n<p>The last step you have to take is change the permission on that file so that it is only readable by your user. PostgreSQL will ignore it if just anyone can read and write to it. This is for <em>your</em> security. Change the file permissions so only you can read and write to it. You did this once upon a time. Here's the command.</p>\n<pre><code>chmod go-rw ~/.pgpass\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can confirm that only you have read/write permission by typing <code>ls -al ~/.pgpass</code>. That should return output that looks like this, <strong>with your Ubuntu user name instead of \"web-dev-hub\".</strong></p>\n<pre><code>-rw------- 1 web-dev-hub web-dev-hub 37 Mar 28 21:20 /home/web-dev-hub/.pgpass\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, try connecting to PostreSQL by typing <code>psql postgres</code>. Because you added the alias to your startup script, and because you created your <strong>.pgpass</strong> file, it should now connect without prompting you for any credentials! Type <code>\\q</code> and press Enter to exit the PostgreSQL command line client.</p>\n<h3>Installing Postbird</h3>\n<p>Head over to the <a href=\"https://github.com/Paxa/postbird/releases\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Postbird releases page on GitHub</a>. Click the installer for Windows which you can recognize because it's the only file in the list that ends with “.exe”.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZdKurvQ4bHs3vDLT.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>After that installer downloads, run it. You will get a warning from Windows that this is from an unidentified developer. If you don't want to install this, find a PostgreSQL GUI client that you do trust and install it or do everything from the command line.\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*EWpFEwM0YUDQCW_i.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>You should get used to seeing this because many open-source applications aren't signed with the Microsoft Store for monetary and philosophical reasons.\n<p>Otherwise, if you trust Paxa like web-dev-hub and tens of thousands of other developers do, then click the link that reads “More info” and the “Run anyway” button.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*9pDpx8XsYt2KnMku.png\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>When it's done installing, it will launch itself. Test it out by typing the “postgres” into the “Username” field and the password from your installation in the “Password” field. Click the Connect button. It should properly connect to the running\n<p>You can close it for now. It also installed an icon on your desktop. You can launch it from there or your Start Menu at any time.</p>\n<h3>Now.. if you still have some gas in the tank… let's put our new tools to work:</h3>\n<h3>The node-postgres</h3>\n<p>The node-postgres is a collection of Node.js modules for interfacing with the PostgreSQL database. It has support for callbacks, promises, async/await, connection pooling, prepared statements, cursors, and streaming results.</p>\n<p>In our examples we also use the Ramda library. See Ramda tutorial for more information.</p>\n<h3>Setting up node-postgres</h3>\n<p>First, we install node-postgres.</p>\n<p>$ node -v<br>\nv14.2</p>\n<p>$ npm init -y</p>\n<p>We initiate a new Node application.</p>\n<p>npm i pg</p>\n<p>We install node-postgres with <code>nmp i pg</code>.</p>\n<p>npm i ramda</p>\n<p>In addition, we install Ramda for beautiful work with data.</p>\n<p>cars.sql</p>\n<p>DROP TABLE IF EXISTS cars;</p>\n<p>CREATE TABLE cars(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), price INT);<br>\nINSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES('Audi', 52642);<br>\nINSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES('Mercedes', 57127);<br>\nINSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES('Skoda', 9000);<br>\nINSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES('Volvo', 29000);<br>\nINSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES('Bentley', 350000);<br>\nINSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES('Citroen', 21000);<br>\nINSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES('Hummer', 41400);<br>\nINSERT INTO cars(name, price) VALUES('Volkswagen', 21600);</p>\n<p>In some of the examples, we use this <code>cars</code> table.</p>\n<h3>The node-postgres first example</h3>\n<p>In the first example, we connect to the PostgreSQL database and return a simple SELECT query result.</p>\n<p>first.js</p>\n<pre><code>const pg = require('pg');\nconst R = require('ramda');\nconst cs = 'postgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb';\nconst client = new pg.Client(cs);\nclient.connect();\nclient.query('SELECT 1 + 4').then(res => {\n\nconst result = R.head(R.values(R.head(res.rows)))\n\nconsole.log(result)\n}).finally(() => client.end());\n</code></pre>\n<p>The example connects to the database and issues a SELECT statement.</p>\n<pre><code>const pg = require('pg');\nconst R = require('ramda');\n</code></pre>\n<p>We include the <code>pg</code> and <code>ramda</code> modules.</p>\n<pre><code>const cs = 'postgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb';\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the PostgreSQL connection string. It is used to build a connection to the database.</p>\n<pre><code>const client = new pg.Client(cs);\nclient.connect();\n</code></pre>\n<p>A client is created. We connect to the database with <code>connect()</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>client.query('SELECT 1 + 4').then(res => {\n\nconst result = R.head(R.values(R.head(res.rows)));\n\nconsole.log(result);\n\n}).finally(() => client.end());\n</code></pre>\n<p>We issue a simple SELECT query. We get the result and output it to the console. The <code>res.rows</code> is an array of objects; we use Ramda to get the returned scalar value. In the end, we close the connection with <code>end()</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>node first.js\n5\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the output.</p>\n<h3>The node-postgres column names</h3>\n<p>In the following example, we get the columns names of a database.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>column_names.js</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>const pg = require('pg');\n\nconst cs = 'postgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb';\n\nconst client = new pg.Client(cs);\n\nclient.connect();\n\nclient.query('SELECT * FROM cars').then(res => {\n\nconst fields = res.fields.map(field => field.name);\n\nconsole.log(fields);\n\n}).catch(err => {\nconsole.log(err.stack);\n}).finally(() => {\nclient.end()\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>The column names are retrieved with <code>res.fields</code> attribute. We also use the <code>catch</code> clause to output potential errors.</p>\n<pre><code>node column_names.js\n'id', 'name', 'price'′id′,′name′,′price′\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output shows three column names of the <code>cars</code> table.</p>\n<h3>Selecting all rows</h3>\n<p>In the next example, we select all rows from the database table.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>all_rows.js</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>const pg = require('pg');\nconst R = require('ramda');\n\nconst cs = 'postgres://postgres:s$cret@localhost:5432/ydb';\n\nconst client = new pg.Client(cs);\n\nclient.connect();\n\nclient.query('SELECT * FROM cars').then(res => {\n\nconst data = res.rows;\n\nconsole.log('all data');\ndata.forEach(row => {\n    console.log(\\`Id: ${row.id} Name: ${row.name} Price: ${row.price}\\`);\n})\n\nconsole.log('Sorted prices:');\nconst prices = R.pluck('price', R.sortBy(R.prop('price'), data));\nconsole.log(prices);\n\n}).finally(() => {\nclient.end()\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>TBC…</strong></p>\n<h4>If you found this guide helpful feel free to checkout my github/gists where I host similar content:</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">bgoonz's gists · GitHub</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\"><strong>bgoonz — Overview</strong><br />\n<em>Web Developer, Electrical Engineer JavaScript | CSS | Bootstrap | Python | React | Node.js | Express | Sequelize…</em>github.com</a><a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock\"></a></p>\n<p>Or Checkout my personal Resource Site:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/\"><strong>Stackbit Web-Dev-HubTheme</strong><br />\n<em>Memoization, Tabulation, and Sorting Algorithms by Example Why is looking at runtime not a reliable method of…</em>bgoonz-blog.netlify.app</a><a href=\"https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/\" class=\"js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock\"></a></p>\n<p>By <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bryanguner\" class=\"p-author h-card\">Bryan Guner</a> on <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/801672ab7089\">March 6, 2021</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@bryanguner/postgresql-setup-for-windows-wsl-ubuntu-801672ab7089\" class=\"p-canonical\">Canonical link</a></p>\n<p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on August 6, 2021.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/quick-reference/pull-request-rubric/","relativePath":"docs/quick-reference/pull-request-rubric.md","relativeDir":"docs/quick-reference","base":"pull-request-rubric.md","name":"pull-request-rubric","frontmatter":{"title":"Pull Request Template","weight":0,"excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>Pull Requests</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Objective</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>1-3 (Not Passing)</th>\n<th>4 (Passing)</th>\n<th>5-7 (Exceptional)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Clearly-documents-the-motivation-and-what-changed-0c7f5d04d7f9401e8e861ce93312d503\">Clearly documents the motivation and what changed</a></td>\n<td>Is it clear why the pull request exists?

This list of directories lives in an environment variable called PATH, with each directory in the list separated by a colon:</p>\n<p>Directories in PATH are searched from left to right, so a matching executable in a directory at the beginning of the list takes precedence over another one at the end. In this example, the /usr/local/bin directory will be searched first, then /usr/bin, then /bin.</p>\n<h3>Understanding Shims</h3>\n<p>pyenv works by inserting a directory of shims at the front of your PATH:</p>\n<p>Through a process called rehashing, pyenv maintains shims in that directory to match every Python command across every installed version of Python---python, pip, and so on.</p>\n<p>Shims are lightweight executables that simply pass your command along to pyenv. So with pyenv installed, when you run, say, pip, your operating system will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search your PATH for an executable file named pip</li>\n<li>Find the pyenv shim named pip at the beginning of your PATH</li>\n<li>Run the shim named pip, which in turn passes the command along to pyenv</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Choosing the Python Version</h3>\n<p>When you execute a shim, pyenv determines which Python version to use by reading it from the following sources, in this order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The PYENV_VERSION environment variable (if specified). You can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-shell\">pyenv shell</a> command to set this environment variable in your current shell session.</li>\n<li>The application-specific .python-version file in the current directory (if present). You can modify the current directory's .python-version file with the <a href=\"https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-local\">pyenv local</a> command.</li>\n<li>The first .python-version file found (if any) by searching each parent directory, until reaching the root of your filesystem.</li>\n<li>The global $(pyenv root)/version file. You can modify this file using the <a href=\"https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md#pyenv-global\">pyenv global</a> command. If the global version file is not present, pyenv assumes you want to use the \"system\" Python. (In other words, whatever version would run if pyenv weren't in your PATH.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can activate multiple versions at the same time, including multiple versions of Python2 or Python3 simultaneously. This allows for parallel usage of Python2 and Python3, and is required with tools like tox. For example, to set your path to first use your system Python and Python3 (set to 2.7.9 and 3.4.2 in this example), but also have Python 3.3.6, 3.2, and 2.5 available on your PATH, one would first pyenv install the missing versions, then set pyenv global system 3.3.6 3.2 2.5. At this point, one should be able to find the full executable path to each of these using pyenv which, e.g. pyenv which python2.5 (should display $(pyenv root)/versions/2.5/bin/python2.5), or pyenv which python3.4 (should display path to system Python3). You can also specify multiple versions in a .python-version file, separated by newlines. Lines starting with a # are ignored.</p>\n<h3>Locating the Python Installation</h3>\n<p>Once pyenv has determined which version of Python your application has specified, it passes the command along to the corresponding Python installation.</p>\n<p>Each Python version is installed into its own directory under $(pyenv root)/versions.</p>\n<p>For example, you might have these versions installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$(pyenv root)/versions/2.7.8/</li>\n<li>$(pyenv root)/versions/3.4.2/</li>\n<li>$(pyenv root)/versions/pypy-2.4.0/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As far as Pyenv is concerned, version names are simply directories under $(pyenv root)/versions.</p>\n<h3>Managing Virtual Environments</h3>\n<p>There is a pyenv plugin named <a href=\"https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv\">pyenv-virtualenv</a> which comes with various features to help pyenv users to manage virtual environments created by virtualenv or Anaconda. Because the activate script of those virtual environments are relying on mutating $PATH variable of user's interactive shell, it will intercept pyenv's shim style command execution hooks. We'd recommend to install pyenv-virtualenv as well if you have some plan to play with those virtual environments.<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0hQBL4d.png\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0hQBL4d.png\"><img src=\"images/festive-zebra.png\"></p>"},{"url":"/docs/react/ajax-n-apis/","relativePath":"docs/react/ajax-n-apis.md","relativeDir":"docs/react","base":"ajax-n-apis.md","name":"ajax-n-apis","frontmatter":{"title":"AJAX and APIs","weight":0,"excerpt":"AJAX and APIs","seo":{"title":"AJAX and APIs","description":"You can use any AJAX library you like with React.

It could be a button, a form with a bunch of fields in it…etc.…</p>\n<p>React doesn't place any restrictions on how large or small a component can be.</p>\n<p>You <em>could</em> have an entire static site encapsulated in a single React component, but that would defeat the purpose of using React.</p>\n<p>So the first thing to remember about a component is that a <strong>component must</strong> <strong><em>render</em></strong> <strong>something.</strong></p>\n<p><em>If nothing is being rendered from a component, then React will throw an error.</em></p>\n<p>Inside of <code>BasicComponent.js</code> , first import React at the top of the file. Our most basic of components looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React from 'react';\n\nconst BasicComponent = () => &#x3C;div>Hello World!&#x3C;/div>;\n\nexport default BasicComponent;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>This is a component that simply returns a div tag with the words Hello World! inside.</em></p>\n<p><em>The last line simply exports our component so that it can be imported</em><br>\n<em>by another file.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice that this component looks exactly like an anonymous arrow function that we've named <code>BasicComponent</code> .</p>\n<p>In fact, that is literally what this is.</p>\n<p>The arrow function then is simply returning the div tag. When a component is written as a function like this one is, it is called a <em>functional</em> component.</p>\n<h2>A Basic Class Component <a id=\"8d7d\"></a></h2>\n<p>The above component is an example of a functional component, which is appropriate since that component is literally nothing more than a function that returns some HTML.</p>\n<p><em>Functional components are great when all you want a component to do is to render some stuff.</em></p>\n<p><em>Components can also be written as classes (although this paradigm is becoming outdated and you should strive to write your components functionally!</em></p>\n<p>For this exercise, we're going to write a class component that does exactly the same thing as the functional component we just wrote.</p>\n<p>We'll again need to import React at the top of the file, but we'll also need to add a little something. Our import statement will look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>So, in addition to importing React, we're also importing the base Component class that is included in the React library.</strong></p>\n<h3>React lets you define components as classes or functions. <a id=\"ed09\"></a></h3>\n<p>Components defined as classes currently provide more features . To define a React component class, you need to extend <code>React.Component</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">class Welcome extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n        return &#x3C;h1>Hello, {this.props.name}&#x3C;/h1>;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The only method you</strong> <strong><em>must</em></strong> <strong>define in a <code>React.Component</code> subclass is called</strong> <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#render\">``</a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<h2><code>render()</code> <a id=\"2c45\"></a></h2>\n<p>The <code>render()</code> method is the only required method in a class component.</p>\n<p>When called, it should examine <code>this.props</code> and <code>this.state</code> and return one of the following types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>React elements.</strong> Typically created via <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html\">JSX</a>. For example, <code>&#x3C;div /></code> and <code>&#x3C;MyComponent /></code> are React elements that instruct React to render a DOM node, or another user-defined component, respectively.</li>\n<li><strong>Arrays and fragments.</strong> Let you return multiple elements from render. See the documentation on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html\">fragments</a> for more details.</li>\n<li><strong>Portals</strong>. Let you render children into a different DOM subtree. See the documentation on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html\">portals</a> for more details.</li>\n<li><strong>String and numbers.</strong> These are rendered as text nodes in the DOM.</li>\n<li><strong>Booleans or <code>null</code></strong>. Render nothing. (Mostly exists to support <code>return test &#x26;&#x26; &#x3C;Child /></code> pattern, where <code>test</code> is boolean.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>render()</code> function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time it's invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser.</p>\n<p>If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in <code>componentDidMount()</code> or the other lifecycle methods instead. Keeping <code>render()</code> pure makes components easier to think about.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Note</em></p>\n<p><code>* will not be invoked if* [</code>](<a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate\">https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate</a>) <em>returns false.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The export statement at the bottom of the file also stays, completely unchanged. Our class component will thus look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass BasicClassComponent extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return &#x3C;div>Hello World!&#x3C;/div>;\n    }\n}\n\nexport default BasicClassComponent;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Notice that our <code>BasicClassComponent</code> inherits from the base <code>Component</code> class that we imported from the React library, by virtue of the 'extends' keyword.</strong></p>\n<p><em>That being said, there's nothing in this minimal component that takes advantage of any of those inherited methods.</em></p>\n<p><strong>All we have is a method on our component class called <code>render</code> that returns the same div tag.</strong></p>\n<p>If we really were deciding between whether to use a functional component versus a class component to render a simple div tag, then the functional style is more appropriate to use.</p>\n<p>This is because class components are much better suited for handling component state and triggering events based on the component's <a href=\"https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/\">lifecycle.</a></p>\n<h3>The important takeaways at this point are that there are two types of components, functional and class components, and that functional components are well-suited if you're just looking to render some HTML. <a id=\"66ab\"></a></h3>\n<p><em>Class components, on the other hand, are much better suited for handling components that require more complex functionality, need to exhibit more varied behavior, and/or need to keep track of some state that may change throughout said component's lifecycle.</em></p>\n<h2>A Class Component with Some State <a id=\"da0a\"></a></h2>\n<p><strong>Component state is any dynamic data that we want the component to keep track of.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, let's say we have a form component. This form has some input fields that we'd like users to fill out. When a user types characters into an input field, how is that input persisted from the point of view of our form component?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The answer is by using component state!</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few important concepts regarding component state, such as how to update it, pass it to another component, render it, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Only class components have the ability to persist state, so if at any time you realize that a component needs to keep track of some state, you know that you'll automatically need a class component instead of a functional component.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is possible to handle state with functional components but that requires the use of something called the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html\">useState() hook</a>. Hooks were added in React 16.8; prior to this release, there was no mechanism to add state to functional components.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's what the above component looks like as a functional component:</p>\n<p>Our class component with state will look a lot like the basic class component we just wrote, but with some exceptions:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass ClassComponentWithState extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.state = {};\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return &#x3C;div>Hello World!&#x3C;/div>;\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ClassComponentWithState;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>So far, the only new thing going on here is the constructor block. If you recall how classes in JavaScript work, classes need constructors.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Additionally, if a class is extending off of another class and wants access to its parent class's methods and properties, then the <code>super</code> function needs to be called inside the class's constructor function.</strong></p>\n<h3>Point being, the constructor function and the call to the <code>super</code> function are <em>not</em> associated with React, they are associated with all JavaScript classes. <a id=\"7791\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Then there is the ``** property inside the constructor function that is set as an empty object**.</li>\n<li>We're adding a property called <code>state</code> to our class and setting it to an empty object.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>State objects in React are always just plain old objects. <a id=\"2e40\"></a></h3>\n<h3><strong>So why is it that the basic class component we wrote in the previous exercise had no constructor function within its body?</strong> <a id=\"a76e\"></a></h3>\n<p>That is because we had no need for them since all our class component was doing was rendering some HTML.</p>\n<p><strong>The constructor is needed here because that is where we need to initialize our state object.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The call to <code>super</code> is needed because we can't reference <code>this</code> inside of our constructor without a call to <code>super</code> first.</strong></p>\n<p>Ok, now let's actually use this state object.</p>\n<p><em>One very common application of state objects in React components is to render the data being stored inside them within our component's render function.</em></p>\n<h3>Refactoring our component class to do that: <a id=\"6929\"></a></h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">class ClassComponentWithState extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.state = {\n            someData: 8\n        };\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return &#x3C;div>{`Here's some data to render: ${this.state.someData}`}&#x3C;/div>;\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ClassComponentWithState;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We added a key-value pair to our state object inside our constructor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Then we changed the contents of the render function.</li>\n<li>Now, it's actually rendering the data that we have inside the state object.</li>\n<li>Notice that inside the div tags we're using a template string literal so that we can access the value of <code>this.state.someData</code> straight inside of our rendered content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>With Reacts newest version, we can actually now add state to a component without explicitly defining a constructor on the class. We can refactor our class component to look like this:</strong></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">class ClassComponentWithState extends Component {\n    state = {\n        someData: 8\n    };\n\n    render() {\n        return &#x3C;div>{`Here's some data to render: ${this.state.someData}`}&#x3C;/div>;\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ClassComponentWithState;\n</code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/3064/1*6sYhFUNpUkt6xN9kkn4pJQ.png\"></p>\n<p>This new syntax is what is often referred to as 'syntactic sugar': under the hood, the React library translates this back into the old constructor code that we first started with, so that the JavaScript remains valid to the JavaScript interpreter.</p>\n<p>The clue to this is the fact that when we want to access some data from the state object, we still need to call it with <code>this.state.someData</code> ; changing it to just <code>state.someData</code> does not work.</p>\n<h2>Class Component Updating State <a id=\"3e29\"></a></h2>\n<p>Great, so we can render some state that our component persists for us.</p>\n<p>However, we said an important use case of component state is to handle <em>dynamic</em> data.</p>\n<p>A single static number isn't very dynamic at all.</p>\n<p>So now let's walk through how to update component state.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass ClassComponentUpdatingState extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.state = {\n            aNumber: 8\n        };\n    }\n\n    increment = () => {\n        this.setState({ aNumber: ++this.state.aNumber });\n    };\n\n    decrement = () => {\n        this.setState({ aNumber: --this.state.aNumber });\n    };\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            &#x3C;div>\n                &#x3C;div>{`Our number: ${this.state.aNumber}`}&#x3C;/div>\n                &#x3C;button onClick={this.increment}>+&#x3C;/button>\n                &#x3C;button onClick={this.decrement}>-&#x3C;/button>\n            &#x3C;/div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ClassComponentUpdatingState;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that we've added two methods to our class: <code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code> .</p>\n<p><code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code> are methods that <em>we</em> are adding to our class component.</p>\n<p>Unlike the <code>render</code> method, <code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code> were not already a part of our class component.</p>\n<p>This is why <code>increment</code> and <code>decrement</code> are written as arrow functions, <strong><em>so that they are automatically bound to our class component.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The alternative is using a declaration syntax function with the bind method to bind the context of our methods to the class component.</p>\n<p>The more interesting thing is what is going on within the bodies of these methods.</p>\n<h3>Each calls the <code>setState</code> function. <a id=\"3d7e\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>setState</code> in fact <em>is</em> provided to us by React.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is the standard way to update a component's state.</p>\n<p>It's the <em>only</em> way you should ever update a component's state. It may seem more verbose than necessary, but there are good reasons for why you should be doing it this way.</p>\n<p>Unlike the lifecycle methods above (which React calls for you), the methods below are the methods <em>you</em> can call from your components.</p>\n<p>There are just two of them: <code>setState()</code> and <code>forceUpdate()</code>.</p>\n<h4><code>setState()</code></h4>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">setState(updater, [callback])\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>setState()</code> enqueues changes to the component state and tells React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state. This is the primary method you use to update the user interface in response to event handlers and server responses.</p>\n<p>Think of <code>setState()</code> as a <em>request</em> rather than an immediate command to update the component. For better perceived performance, React may delay it, and then update several components in a single pass. React does not guarantee that the state changes are applied immediately.</p>\n<p><code>setState()</code> does not always immediately update the component. It may batch or defer the update until later. This makes reading <code>this.state</code> right after calling <code>setState()</code> a potential pitfall. Instead, use <code>componentDidUpdate</code> or a <code>setState</code> callback (<code>setState(updater, callback)</code>), either of which are guaranteed to fire after the update has been applied. If you need to set the state based on the previous state, read about the <code>updater</code> argument below.</p>\n<p><code>setState()</code> will always lead to a re-render unless <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> returns <code>false</code>. If mutable objects are being used and conditional rendering logic cannot be implemented in <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code>, calling <code>setState()</code> only when the new state differs from the previous state will avoid unnecessary re-renders.</p>\n<p>The first argument is an <code>updater</code> function with the signature:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">(state, props) => stateChange\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>state</code> is a reference to the component state at the time the change is being applied. It should not be directly mutated. Instead, changes should be represented by building a new object based on the input from <code>state</code> and <code>props</code>. For instance, suppose we wanted to increment a value in state by <code>props.step</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">this.setState((state, props) => {\n  return {counter: state.counter + props.step};\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both <code>state</code> and <code>props</code> received by the updater function are guaranteed to be up-to-date. The output of the updater is shallowly merged with <code>state</code>.</p>\n<p>The second parameter to <code>setState()</code> is an optional callback function that will be executed once <code>setState</code> is completed and the component is re-rendered. Generally we recommend using <code>componentDidUpdate()</code> for such logic instead.</p>\n<p>You may optionally pass an object as the first argument to <code>setState()</code> instead of a function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">setState(stateChange[, callback])\n</code></pre>\n<p>This performs a shallow merge of <code>stateChange</code> into the new state, e.g., to adjust a shopping cart item quantity:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">this.setState({quantity: 2})\n</code></pre>\n<p>This form of <code>setState()</code> is also asynchronous, and multiple calls during the same cycle may be batched together. For example, if you attempt to increment an item quantity more than once in the same cycle, that will result in the equivalent of:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">Object.assign(\n  previousState,\n  {quantity: state.quantity + 1},\n  {quantity: state.quantity + 1},\n  ...\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Subsequent calls will override values from previous calls in the same cycle, so the quantity will only be incremented once. If the next state depends on the current state, we recommend using the updater function form, instead:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-text\">this.setState((state) => {\n  return {quantity: state.quantity + 1};\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h3>So the way to use <code>setState</code> to update a component's state is to pass it an object with each of the state keys you wish to update, along with the updated value. <a id=\"bd27\"></a></h3>\n<p>In our <code>increment</code> method we said \"I would like to update the <code>aNumber</code> property on my component state by adding one to it and then setting the new value as my new <code>aNumber</code> \".</p>\n<p>The same thing happens in our <code>decrement</code> method, only we're subtracting instead of adding.</p>\n<p>Then the other new concept we're running into here is how to actually call these methods we've added to our class.<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*k8t5QBcMvHDX521sd4pC4g.png?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/856/1*k8t5QBcMvHDX521sd4pC4g.png\"></p>\n<p>We added two HTML button tags within our <code>render</code> function, then in their respective <code>onClick</code> handlers, we specify the method that should be called whenever this button gets clicked. So whenever we click either of the buttons, our state gets updated appropriately and our component will re-render to show the correct value we're expecting.</p>\n<h2>Class Component Iterating State <a id=\"e859\"></a></h2>\n<p>Another common state pattern you'll see being used in React components is iterating over an array in our state object and rendering each array element in its own tag.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is often used in order to render lists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, we want to be able to easily update lists and have React re-render our updated list.</p>\n<p>We'll see how both of these are done and how they work together within a single component in order to create the behavior of a dynamic list.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass ClassComponentIteratingState extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n\n        this.state = {\n            ingredients: ['flour', 'eggs', 'milk', 'sugar', 'vanilla extract'],\n            newIngredient: ''\n        };\n    }\n\n    handleIngredientInput = (event) => {\n        this.setState({ newIngredient: event.target.value });\n    };\n\n    addIngredient = (event) => {\n        event.preventDefault();\n        const ingredientsList = this.state.ingredients;\n        ingredientsList.push(this.state.newIngredient);\n        this.setState({\n            newIngredient: '',\n            ingredients: ingredientsList\n        });\n    };\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            &#x3C;div>\n                {this.state.ingredients.map((ingredient) => (\n                    &#x3C;div>{ingredient}&#x3C;/div>\n                ))}\n                &#x3C;form onSubmit={this.addIngredient}>\n                    &#x3C;input type=\"text\" onChange={this.handleIngredientInput} placeholder=\"Add a new ingredient\" value={this.state.newIngredient} />\n                &#x3C;/form>\n            &#x3C;/div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ClassComponentIteratingState;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first change to note is that our state object now has an 'ingredients' array, and a 'newIngredient' field that has been initialized to an empty string.</p>\n<p>The ingredients array contains the elements that we'll want to render in our list.</p>\n<p>The <code>addIngredient</code> and <code>handleIngredientInput</code> methods we've added to our class receives a parameter called 'event'.</p>\n<p>This event object is part of the browser's API.</p>\n<p>When we interact with some DOM element, <strong>such as clicking on an HTML button, the</strong> <strong><em>function that is invoked upon that button being clicked</em></strong> <strong>actually receives the event object.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>So when we type some input into an input tag, we're able grab each character that was typed into the input field through the event object parameter.</li>\n<li>The <code>handleIngredientInput</code> method is what gets invoked every time the user presses a key to enter text in the input box for adding a new ingredient.</li>\n<li>Every character the user types gets persisted in the <code>newIngredient</code> field on the state object.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're able to grab the text in the input box using <code>event.target.value</code></p>\n<p><strong>Which holds the value of the string text that is currently in the input box</strong>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We use that to update our <code>newIngredient</code> string field.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Breaking down the <code>addIngredient</code> method, we see this <code>event.preventDefault()</code> invocation.</p>\n<p>This is because this method will be used upon submitting a form, and it turns out that submitting a form triggers some default form behavior that we don't want to trigger when we submit the form (<strong>namely refreshing the entire page</strong>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>event.preventDefault()</code> will prevent this default form behavior, meaning our form will only do what we want it to do when it is submitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/894/1*RN_y7Bk4tb-LLG8vNqGHHA.png\"></p>\n<p>Next, we store a reference to <code>this.state.ingredients</code> in a variable called <code>ingredientsList</code> .</p>\n<p>So we now have a copy of the array that is stored in our state object.</p>\n<p><strong>We want to update the copy of the ingredients array first instead of directly updating the actual array itself in state.</strong></p>\n<p>Now we push whatever value is being stored at our <code>newIngredient</code> field onto the <code>ingredientsList</code> array so that our <code>ingredientsList</code> array is now more up-to-date than our <code>this.state.ingredients</code> array.</p>\n<p>So all we have to do now is call <code>setState</code> appropriately in order to update the value in our state object.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we also set the <code>newIngredient</code> field back to an empty string in order to clear out the input field once we submit a new ingredient.</p>\n<p>Now it's ready to accept more user input!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*LXx7WeP_5wFRfYa45snSEA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/478/1*LXx7WeP_5wFRfYa45snSEA.png\"></p>\n<p>Looking at our render function, first note the <code>this.state.ingredients.map</code> call.</p>\n<p>This is looping through each ingredient in our <code>ingredients</code> array and returning each one within its own div tag.</p>\n<p>This is a very common pattern for rendering everything inside an array.</p>\n<p>Then we have an HTML form which contains an input field.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this form is to allow a user to add new ingredients to the list. Note that we're passing our <code>addIngredient</code> method to the form's <code>onSubmit</code> handler.</p>\n<p>This means that our <code>addIngredient</code> method gets invoked whenever our form is submitted.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the input field has an <code>onChange</code> handler that invokes our <code>handleIngredientInput</code> method whenever there is some sort of change in the input field, namely when a user types into it.<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*S7s9FfaPVlKGyaSwFeId_w.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/816/1*S7s9FfaPVlKGyaSwFeId_w.png\"></p>\n<p>Notice that the <code>value</code> field in our input tag reads off of <code>this.state.newIngredient</code> in order to know what value to display.</p>\n<p>So when a user enters text into the input field, the <code>onChange</code> handler is invoked every time, which updates our <code>this.state.newIngredient</code> field, which the input field and then renders.</p>\n<h2>Parent and Child Components <a id=\"413c\"></a></h2>\n<p>A single isolated component isn't going to do us much good.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The beauty of React lies in the fact that it allows us to compose modular components together.</p>\n<p>Let's start off with the component we just saw, but let's change its name to `` .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';\n\nclass ParentComponent extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n\n        this.state = {\n            ingredients: ['flour', 'eggs', 'milk', 'sugar', 'vanilla'],\n            newIngredient: ''\n        };\n    }\n\n    handleIngredientInput = (event) => {\n        this.setState({ newIngredient: event.target.value });\n    };\n\n    addIngredient = (event) => {\n        event.preventDefault();\n        const ingredientsList = this.state.ingredients;\n        ingredientsList.push(this.state.newIngredient);\n        this.setState({\n            newIngredient: '',\n            ingredients: ingredientsList\n        });\n    };\n\n    render() {\n        return (\n            &#x3C;div>\n                {this.state.ingredients.map((ingredient) => (\n                    &#x3C;ChildComponent thing={ingredient} />\n                ))}\n                &#x3C;form onSubmit={this.addIngredient}>\n                    &#x3C;input type=\"text\" onChange={this.handleIngredientInput} placeholder=\"Add a new ingredient\" value={this.state.newIngredient} />\n                &#x3C;/form>\n            &#x3C;/div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ParentComponent;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The only two other differences in this component are that we're importing a <code>ChildComponent</code> and then using it inside our <code>this.state.ingredients.map</code> call.</p>\n<p><code>ChildComponent</code> is another React component.</p>\n<p>Notice that we're using it just as if it were any other HTML tag.</p>\n<p><strong>This is how we lay out our component hierarchy: the ChildComponent is rendered within the ParentComponent.</strong></p>\n<p>We can see this to be the case if we open up the developer console and inspect these elements.<strong>child-left: parent-right</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2602/1*q_XLnJ2h1L5yZjNnSKzj5w.png\"></p>\n<p>Note also that we're passing each ingredient as a 'thing' to the ChildComponent component.</p>\n<p>This is how a parent component passes data to a child component. It doesn't need to be called 'thing'; you can call it whatever you want.</p>\n<p>Conceptually though, <strong>every piece of data that a parent component passes down to a child component is called a 'prop' in React lingo.</strong></p>\n<p>Let's take a look now at the Child Component. It serves two purposes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to render the props data that it gets from a parent component,</li>\n<li>to add the ability for a user to click on it and have it toggle a strikethrough, indicating that the item is 'complete'.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass ChildComponent extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n        this.state = {\n            clicked: false\n        };\n    }\n\n    handleClick = () => {\n        this.setState({ clicked: !this.state.clicked });\n    };\n\n    render() {\n        const styles = this.state.clicked ? { textDecoration: 'line-through' } : { textDecoration: 'none' };\n        return (\n            &#x3C;div style={styles} onClick={this.handleClick}>\n                {this.props.thing}\n            &#x3C;/div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ChildComponent;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The overall structure of the child component is nothing we haven't seen. It's just another class component with its own s<strong>tate object and a method called <code>handleClick</code> .</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A component accesses its props via the <code>this.props</code> object.</strong></p>\n<p><em>Any prop a parent component passes down to a child component is accessible inside the child component's <code>this.prop</code> object.</em></p>\n<p>So our child component keeps its own state that tracks whether the component has been clicked or not.</p>\n<p>Then at the top of the <code>render</code> function, it uses a ternary condition to determine whether the div tag that is being rendered should have a strikethrough or not.</p>\n<p>The <code>handleClick</code> method is then invoked via an <code>onClick</code> handler on the div tag; it does the work of toggling the <code>this.state.clicked</code> Boolean.</p>\n<p>The overall structure of React applications can be represented as a hierarchical tree structure, just like how the DOM itself is structure. There is an overarching root component at the top of the hierarchy that every other component sits underneath. Specifying that a component should be a child of some parent component is as simple as throwing it in the parent component's render function, just like how we did it in this example<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*aqqfHMjBXT8PWYJC?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/490/0*aqqfHMjBXT8PWYJC\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*j9aPKza7Y4htBeQ-.gif\"></p>\n<h2><strong>Core Concepts:</strong> <a id=\"c45d\"></a></h2>\n<h3>1. What is react? <a id=\"068e\"></a></h3>\n<h3>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses components to update and render as your data changes. <a id=\"a7cb\"></a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>React manages the <strong>creation and continuous updating of DOM nodes in your Web page</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>It does not handle</em> <a href=\"https://skillcrush.com/blog/what-is-ajax/\"><em>AJAX</em> </a><em>requests, Local Storage or style your website. IT is just a tool to dynamically render content on a webpage as a result of changes in 'state'. Because it's function is so limited in scope you may hear it referred to as a library… (not a framework … like Angular for example) and you may also hear it described as unopinionated.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Why use react? <a id=\"643d\"></a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Works for teams and helps UI workflow patterns</li>\n<li>The components can be reusable</li>\n<li>Componentized UI is the future of web dev</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pFe_v7Ea--vfdmvR3UcunA.png?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/846/1*pFe_v7Ea--vfdmvR3UcunA.png\"></p>\n<h2>Declarative programming <a id=\"994b\"></a></h2>\n<p>In the same way that you use HTML to <em>declare</em> what the user interface should<br>\nlook like, React provides the same mechanism in its `` method or the higher-level language known as JSX.<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*MW-A5Dp_v1T0BB1s.png?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1338/0*MW-A5Dp_v1T0BB1s.png\">React… like HTML is Declarative</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming\">Declarative programming</a> is often defined as any style of programming that is not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming\">imperative</a>.</p>\n<p>A number of other common definitions attempt to define it by simply contrasting it with imperative programming. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A high-level program that describes what a computation should perform.</li>\n<li>Any programming language that lacks <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29\">side effects</a></li>\n<li>A language with a clear correspondence to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic\">mathematical logic</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These definitions overlap substantially.</p>\n<p>D<strong>eclarative programming is a non-imperative style of programming in which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands or steps that must be performed.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\">Functional</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_programming\">logical programming</a> languages are characterized by a declarative programming style.</p>\n<p><em>In a</em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_functional_language\"><em>pure functional language</em></a><em>, such as</em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29\"><em>Haskell</em></a><em>, all functions are</em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function\"><em>without side effects</em></a><em>, and state changes are only represented as functions that transform the state, which is explicitly represented as a</em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_citizen\"><em>first-class</em></a> <em>object in the program.</em></p>\n<p>— Wikipedia</p>\n<h2>What is a React pure component? <a id=\"abbb\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.logrocket.com/react-pure-components-functional/#whatisareactpurecomponent\">Based on the concept of purity in functional programming paradigms, a function is said to be pure if:</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its return value is only determined by its input values</li>\n<li>Its return value is always the same for the same input values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A React component is considered pure if it renders the same output for the same state and props. For class components like this, React provides the <code>PureComponent</code> base class. Class components that extend the <code>React.PureComponent</code> class are treated as pure components.</p>\n<p>Pure components have some performance improvements and render optimizations since React implements the <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> method for them with a shallow comparison for props and state.</p>\n<h2>Are React functional components pure? <a id=\"e24e\"></a></h2>\n<p>Functional components are very useful in React, especially when you want to isolate state management from the component. That's why they are often called stateless components.</p>\n<p>However, functional components cannot leverage the performance improvements and render optimizations that come with <code>React.PureComponent</code> since they are not classes by definition.</p>\n<p>If you want React to treat a functional component as a pure component, you'll have to convert the functional component to a class component that extends <code>React.PureComponent</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">function PercentageStat({ label, score = 0, total = Math.max(1, score) }) {\n    return (\n        &#x3C;div>\n            &#x3C;h6>{label}&#x3C;/h6>\n            &#x3C;span>{Math.round((score / total) * 100)}%&#x3C;/span>\n        &#x3C;/div>\n    );\n}\n\n// CONVERTED TO PURE COMPONENT\nclass PercentageStat extends React.PureComponent {\n    render() {\n        const { label, score = 0, total = Math.max(1, score) } = this.props;\n\n        return (\n            &#x3C;div>\n                &#x3C;h6>{label}&#x3C;/h6>\n                &#x3C;span>{Math.round((score / total) * 100)}%&#x3C;/span>\n            &#x3C;/div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Reusability <a id=\"9c36\"></a></h2>\n<p>React encourages you to think in terms of reusability as you construct the user<br>\ninterface from elements and components that you create. When you<br>\nmake a list or a button, you can then reuse those components to show different data 'state' in the same UI structure as you have built for different data previously.<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*cBLQ5aBP2qihrT59.jpeg?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1885/0*cBLQ5aBP2qihrT59.jpeg\"></p>\n<h3>Component-Based <a id=\"a38d\"></a></h3>\n<p>Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.</p>\n<p>Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.</p>\n<h3>Learn Once, Write Anywhere <a id=\"fc7f\"></a></h3>\n<p>We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.</p>\n<p>React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev/\">React Native</a>.</p>\n<h2>Speed <a id=\"345f\"></a></h2>\n<p>Due to the use of a virtual DOM, React handles changes to a Web page more<br>\nintelligently than just string manipulation. It is constantly monitors the<br>\nvirtual DOM for changes. It very efficiently reconciles changes in the virtual<br>\nDOM with what it has already produced in the real DOM. This is what<br>\nmakes React one of the speediest front-end libraries available.<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*OdOq6pmpXBJhjj7k.png?q=20\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/810/0*OdOq6pmpXBJhjj7k.png\"></p>\n<h3>3.

This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by <code>render()</code> via <code>this.props</code>.</p>\n<p>JSX is optional and not required to use React.

This example uses <code>state</code> to track the current list of items as well as the text that the user has entered. Although event handlers appear to be rendered inline, they will be collected and implemented using event delegation.</p>\n<h3>A Component Using External Plugins <a id=\"2276\"></a></h3>\n<p>React allows you to interface with other libraries and frameworks.

We assign the new array returned by <code>map()</code> to the variable <code>doubled</code> and log it:</p>\n<pre><code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);console.log(doubled);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code logs <code>[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code> to the console.</p>\n<p>In React, transforming arrays into lists of <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html\">elements</a> is nearly identical.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#rendering-multiple-components\"></a>Rendering Multiple Components</h3>\n<p>You can build collections of elements and <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx\">include them in JSX</a> using curly braces <code>{}</code>.</p>\n<p>Below, we loop through the <code>numbers</code> array using the JavaScript <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\"><code>map()</code></a> function. We return a <code>&#x3C;li></code> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to <code>listItems</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst listItems = numbers.map((number) =>  &#x3C;li>{number}&#x3C;/li>);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We include the entire <code>listItems</code> array inside a <code>&#x3C;ul></code> element, and <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom\">render it to the DOM</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>ReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;ul>{listItems}&#x3C;/ul>,  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/GjPyQr?editors=0011\"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>\n<p>This code displays a bullet list of numbers between 1 and 5.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#basic-list-component\"></a>Basic List Component</h3>\n<p>Usually you would render lists inside a <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html\">component</a>.</p>\n<p>We can refactor the previous example into a component that accepts an array of <code>numbers</code> and outputs a list of elements.</p>\n<pre><code>function NumberList(props) {\n  const numbers = props.numbers;\n  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>    &#x3C;li>{number}&#x3C;/li>  );  return (\n    &#x3C;ul>{listItems}&#x3C;/ul>  );\n}\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;NumberList numbers={numbers} />,  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you run this code, you’ll be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items. A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. We’ll discuss why it’s important in the next section.</p>\n<p>Let’s assign a <code>key</code> to our list items inside <code>numbers.map()</code> and fix the missing key issue.</p>\n<pre><code>function NumberList(props) {\n  const numbers = props.numbers;\n  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>\n    &#x3C;li key={number.toString()}>      {number}\n    &#x3C;/li>\n  );\n  return (\n    &#x3C;ul>{listItems}&#x3C;/ul>\n  );\n}\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;NumberList numbers={numbers} />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/jrXYRR?editors=0011\"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys\"></a>Keys</h2>\n<p>Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:</p>\n<pre><code>const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst listItems = numbers.map((number) =>\n  &#x3C;li key={number.toString()}>    {number}\n  &#x3C;/li>\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:</p>\n<pre><code>const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>\n  &#x3C;li key={todo.id}>    {todo.text}\n  &#x3C;/li>\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:</p>\n<pre><code>const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>\n    &#x3C;li key={index}>    {todo.text}\n  &#x3C;/li>\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. Check out Robin Pokorny’s article for an <a href=\"https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318\">in-depth explanation on the negative impacts of using an index as a key</a>. If you choose not to assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys.</p>\n<p>Here is an <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#recursing-on-children\">in-depth explanation about why keys are necessary</a> if you’re interested in learning more.</p>\n<p>Keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array.</p>\n<p>For example, if you <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components\">extract</a> a <code>ListItem</code> component, you should keep the key on the <code>&#x3C;ListItem /></code> elements in the array rather than on the <code>&#x3C;li></code> element in the <code>ListItem</code> itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Example: Incorrect Key Usage</strong></p>\n<pre><code>function ListItem(props) {\n  const value = props.value;\n  return (\n        &#x3C;li key={value.toString()}>      {value}\n    &#x3C;/li>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction NumberList(props) {\n  const numbers = props.numbers;\n  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>\n        &#x3C;ListItem value={number} />  );\n  return (\n    &#x3C;ul>\n      {listItems}\n    &#x3C;/ul>\n  );\n}\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;NumberList numbers={numbers} />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Example: Correct Key Usage</strong></p>\n<pre><code>function ListItem(props) {\n    return &#x3C;li>{props.value}&#x3C;/li>;}\n\nfunction NumberList(props) {\n  const numbers = props.numbers;\n  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>\n        &#x3C;ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />  );\n  return (\n    &#x3C;ul>\n      {listItems}\n    &#x3C;/ul>\n  );\n}\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;NumberList numbers={numbers} />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ZXeOGM?editors=0010\"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the <code>map()</code> call need keys.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys-must-only-be-unique-among-siblings\"></a>Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings</h3>\n<p>Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However, they don’t need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays:</p>\n<pre><code>function Blog(props) {\n  const sidebar = (    &#x3C;ul>\n      {props.posts.map((post) =>\n        &#x3C;li key={post.id}>          {post.title}\n        &#x3C;/li>\n      )}\n    &#x3C;/ul>\n  );\n  const content = props.posts.map((post) =>    &#x3C;div key={post.id}>      &#x3C;h3>{post.title}&#x3C;/h3>\n      &#x3C;p>{post.content}&#x3C;/p>\n    &#x3C;/div>\n  );\n  return (\n    &#x3C;div>\n      {sidebar}      &#x3C;hr />\n      {content}    &#x3C;/div>\n  );\n}\n\nconst posts = [\n  {id: 1, title: 'Hello World', content: 'Welcome to learning React!'},\n  {id: 2, title: 'Installation', content: 'You can install React from npm.'}\n];\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;Blog posts={posts} />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/NRZYGN?editors=0010\"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>\n<p>Keys serve as a hint to React but they don’t get passed to your components. If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name:</p>\n<pre><code>const content = posts.map((post) =>\n  &#x3C;Post\n    key={post.id}    id={post.id}    title={post.title} />\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>With the example above, the <code>Post</code> component can read <code>props.id</code>, but not <code>props.key</code>.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#embedding-map-in-jsx\"></a>Embedding map() in JSX</h3>\n<p>In the examples above we declared a separate <code>listItems</code> variable and included it in JSX:</p>\n<pre><code>function NumberList(props) {\n  const numbers = props.numbers;\n  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>    &#x3C;ListItem key={number.toString()}              value={number} />  );  return (\n    &#x3C;ul>\n      {listItems}\n    &#x3C;/ul>\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>JSX allows <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx\">embedding any expression</a> in curly braces so we could inline the <code>map()</code> result:</p>\n<pre><code>function NumberList(props) {\n  const numbers = props.numbers;\n  return (\n    &#x3C;ul>\n      {numbers.map((number) =>        &#x3C;ListItem key={number.toString()}                  value={number} />      )}    &#x3C;/ul>\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/BLvYrB?editors=0010\"><strong>Try it on CodePen</strong></a></p>\n<p>Sometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused. Like in JavaScript, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability. Keep in mind that if the <code>map()</code> body is too nested, it might be a good time to <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components\">extract a component</a>.</p>\n<p>So many times I have seen developers use the <em>index</em> of an item as its <em>key</em> when they render a list.</p>\n<p>todos.map((todo, index) => (<br>\n&#x3C;Todo {...todo} key={index} /><br>\n));<br>\n}</p>\n<p>It looks elegant and it does get rid of the warning (which was the ‘real’ issue, right?). What is the danger here?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It may break your application and display wrong data!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let me explain, a <em>key</em> is the only thing React uses to identify DOM elements. What happens if you push an item to the list or remove something in the middle? If the <em>key</em> is same as before React assumes that the DOM element represents the same component as before. But that is no longer true.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/27/1*9N62zUlyJcQet8kr7e_FVg.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*9N62zUlyJcQet8kr7e_FVg.png\"></p>\n<p>Stephen describes the problem he run into on <a href=\"https://egghead.io/forums/lesson-discussion/topics/break-up-components-into-smaller-pieces-using-functional-components#post-6310\">egghead.io</a></p>\n<p>To demonstrate the potential danger I created <a href=\"https://jsbin.com/wohima/edit?output\">a simple example</a> (<a href=\"http://jsbin.com/wohima/edit?js,output\">with source</a>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/630/1*GFYGPdDFLYcLFzx-E-GEcw.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>Screenshot of the example showing the danger of using the index as key.</p>\n<p>It turns out, when nothing is passed React uses the <em>index</em> as <em>key</em> because it is the best guess at the moment. Moreover, it will warn you that it is suboptimal (it says that in a bit confusing words, yes). If you provide it by yourself React just thinks that you know what you are doing which — remember the example — can lead to unpredictable results.</p>\n<h2>Better</h2>\n<p>Each such item should have a <em>permanent</em> and <em>unique</em> property. Ideally, it should be assigned when the item is created. Of course, I am speaking about an <em>id</em>. Then we can use it the following way:</p>\n<p>{<br>\ntodos.map((todo) => (<br>\n&#x3C;Todo {...todo} key={todo.id} /><br>\n));<br>\n}</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> First look at the existing properties of the items. It is possible they already have something that can be used as an <em>id</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One way to do so it to just move the numbering one step up in the abstraction. Using a global index makes sure any two items would have different <em>id</em>s.</p>\n<p>let todoCounter = 1;const createNewTodo = (text) => ({<br>\ncompleted: false,<br>\nid: todoCounter++,<br>\ntext<br>\n}</p>\n<h2>Much better</h2>\n<p>A production solution should use a more robust approach that would handle a distributed creation of items. For such, I recommend <a href=\"https://github.com/ai/nanoid/\">nanoid</a>. It quickly generates short non-sequential url-friendly unique ids. The code could look like the following:</p>\n<p>import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';const createNewTodo = (text) => ({<br>\ncompleted: false,<br>\nid: nanoid(),<br>\ntext<br>\n}</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Generate a unique <em>id</em> for every item and use it as <em>key</em> when rendering the list.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Update: Exception from the rule</h2>\n<p>Many people asked if they always, <em>always</em> have to generate ids. Others have suggested use cases when using the index as a key seems justifiable.</p>\n<p>It is true that sometimes generating new ids is redundant and may be avoided. For example translation of license terms or list of contributors.</p>\n<p>To help you decide, I put together three conditions which these examples have in common:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the list and items are static–they are not computed and do not change;</li>\n<li>the items in the list have no ids;</li>\n<li>the list is <em>never</em> reordered or filtered.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When <em>all</em> of them are met, you <strong>may safely use the index as a key</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Update 2: React, Preact, and *react</h2>\n<p>Although in this article I write about React, the problem is not exclusive to it. In similar libraries, like Preact, the danger is present, too. However, the effects can be different.</p>\n<p>See the following StackOverflow question, where the last element disappears.

We will come back to components in a <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html\">further section</a>, but if you're not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY\">this talk</a> might convince you otherwise.</p>\n<p>React <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html\">doesn't require</a> using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, let's get started!</p>\n<h3>Embedding Expressions in JSX</h3>\n<p>In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:</p>\n<p>You can put any valid <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions\">JavaScript expression</a> inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.</p>\n<p>In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an &#x3C;h1> element.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/introducing-jsx\">Try it on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn't required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/2846283\">automatic semicolon insertion</a>.</p>\n<h3>JSX is an Expression Too</h3>\n<p>After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.</p>\n<p>This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:</p>\n<h3>Specifying Attributes with JSX</h3>\n<p>You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:</p>\n<p>You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:</p>\n<p>Don't put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example, class becomes <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className\">className</a> in JSX, and tabindex becomes <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/tabIndex\">tabIndex</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Specifying Children with JSX</h3>\n<p>If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />, like XML:</p>\n<p>JSX tags may contain children:</p>\n<h3>JSX Prevents Injection Attacks</h3>\n<p>It is safe to embed user input in JSX:</p>\n<p>By default, React DOM <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html\">escapes</a> any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that's not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\">XSS (cross-site-scripting)</a> attacks.</p>\n<h3>JSX Represents Objects</h3>\n<p>Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.</p>\n<p>These two examples are identical:</p>\n<p>React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:</p>\n<p>These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.</p>\n<p>We will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html\">next section</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Tip:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend using the <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/editors\">“Babel” language definition</a> for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX code is properly highlighted.</p>\n</blockquote>"},{"url":"/docs/react/render-elements/","relativePath":"docs/react/render-elements.md","relativeDir":"docs/react","base":"render-elements.md","name":"render-elements","frontmatter":{"title":"Rendering Elements With React","weight":0,"excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>Rendering Elements\n\n</h1>\n<p>Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.</p>\n<p>An element describes what you want to see on the screen:</p>\n<p>Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. We will introduce components in the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html\">next section</a>. Elements are what components are “made of”, and we encourage you to read this section before jumping ahead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Rendering an Element into the DOM</h2>\n<p>Let's say there is a &#x3C;div> somewhere in your HTML file:</p>\n<p>We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.</p>\n<p>Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.</p>\n<p>To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\">ReactDOM.render()</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/render-an-element\">Try it on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>It displays “Hello, world” on the page.</p>\n<h2>Updating the Rendered Element</h2>\n<p>React elements are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object\">immutable</a>. Once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.</p>\n<p>With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\">ReactDOM.render()</a>.</p>\n<p>Consider this ticking clock example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/update-rendered-element\">Try it on CodePen</a></p>\n<p>It calls <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\">ReactDOM.render()</a> every second from a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval\">setInterval()</a> callback.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In practice, most React apps only call <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render\">ReactDOM.render()</a> once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html\">stateful components</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recommend that you don't skip topics because they build on each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>React Only Updates What's Necessary</h2>\n<p>React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.</p>\n<p>You can verify by inspecting the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/rendering-elements/update-rendered-element\">last example</a> with the browser tools:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://reactjs.org/c158617ed7cc0eac8f58330e49e48224/granular-dom-updates.gif\"></p>\n<p>Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM.</p>\n<p>In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/reference/bash-commands/","relativePath":"docs/reference/bash-commands.md","relativeDir":"docs/reference","base":"bash-commands.md","name":"bash-commands","frontmatter":{"title":"Bash-Commands","weight":0,"seo":{"title":"Bash-Commands","description":"This is the Bash-Commands page","extra":[{"name":"og:type","value":"website","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:title","value":"Bash-Commands","keyName":"property"},{"name":"og:description","value":"This is the Bash-Commands page","keyName":"property"},{"name":"twitter:card","value":"summary"},{"name":"twitter:title","value":"Bash-Commands"},{"name":"twitter:description","value":"This is the Bash-Commands page"}]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>My Commands:</h2>\n<h4>Find:</h4>\n<h1>To find files by case-insensitive extension (ex: .jpg, .JPG, .jpG):</h1>\n<p>find . -iname \"*.jpg\"</p>\n<h1>To find directories:</h1>\n<p>find . -type d</p>\n<h1>To find files:</h1>\n<p>find . -type f</p>\n<h1>To find files by octal permission:</h1>\n<p>find . -type f -perm 777</p>\n<h1>To find files with setuid bit set:</h1>\n<p>find . -xdev ( -perm -4000 ) -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l</p>\n<h1>To find files with extension '.txt' and remove them:</h1>\n<p>find ./path/ -name '*.txt' -exec rm '{}' ;</p>\n<h1>To find files with extension '.txt' and look for a string into them:</h1>\n<p>find ./path/ -name '*.txt' | xargs grep 'string'</p>\n<h1>To find files with size bigger than 5 Mebibyte and sort them by size:</h1>\n<p>find . -size +5M -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -Ssh | sort -z</p>\n<h1>To find files bigger than 2 Megabyte and list them:</h1>\n<p>find . -type f -size +200000000c -exec ls -lh {} ; | awk '{ print $9 \": \" $5 }'</p>\n<h1>To find files modified more than 7 days ago and list file information:</h1>\n<p>find . -type f -mtime +7d -ls</p>\n<h1>To find symlinks owned by a user and list file information:</h1>\n<p>find . -type l -user <username-or-userid> -ls</p>\n<h1>To search for and delete empty directories:</h1>\n<p>find . -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} ;</p>\n<h1>To search for directories named build at a max depth of 2 directories:</h1>\n<p>find . -maxdepth 2 -name build -type d</p>\n<h1>To search all files who are not in .git directory:</h1>\n<p>find . ! -iwholename '<em>.git</em>' -type f</p>\n<h1>To find all files that have the same node (hard link) as MY<em>FILE</em>HERE:</h1>\n<p>find . -type f -samefile MY<em>FILE</em>HERE 2>/dev/null</p>\n<h1>To find all files in the current directory and modify their permissions:</h1>\n<p>find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} ;</p>\n<hr>\n<h1>1.

commands; to aid self-discovery of commands.</p>\n<h3>Finding gcloud commands</h3>\n<p>The gcloud command-line tool is a tree; non-leaf nodes are command groups and leaf nodes are commands. (Also, tab completion works for commands and resources!)</p>\n<p>Most gcloud commands follow the following format:</p>\n<p>For example: gcloud + compute + instances + create + example-instance-1 + --zone=us-central1-a</p>\n<h4>Release level</h4>\n<p><em>Release Level</em> refers to the command's release status.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> alpha for alpha commands, beta for beta commands, no release level needed for GA commands.</p>\n<h4>Component</h4>\n<p><em>Component</em> refers to the different Google Cloud services.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> compute for Compute Engine, app for App Engine, etc.</p>\n<h4>Entity</h4>\n<p><em>Entity</em> refers to the plural form of an element or collection of elements under a component.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> disks, firewalls, images, instances, regions, zones for compute</p>\n<h4>Operation</h4>\n<p><em>Operation</em> refers to the imperative verb form of the operation to be performed on the entity.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> Common operations are describe, list, create/update, delete/clear, import, export, copy, remove, add, reset, restart, restore, run, and deploy.</p>\n<h4>Positional args</h4>\n<p><em>Positional args</em> refer to the required, order-specific arguments needed to execute the command.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> &#x3C;INSTANCE_NAMES> is the required positional argument for gcloud compute instances create.</p>\n<h4>Flags</h4>\n<p><em>Flags</em> refer to the additional arguments, --flag-name(=value), passed in to the command after positional args.</p>\n<p><em>Example:</em> --machine-type=&#x3C;MACHINE_TYPE> and --preemptible are optional flags for gcloud compute instances create.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/reference/how-2-reinstall-npm/","relativePath":"docs/reference/how-2-reinstall-npm.md","relativeDir":"docs/reference","base":"how-2-reinstall-npm.md","name":"how-2-reinstall-npm","frontmatter":{"title":"How To Reinstall NPM and Node.js On Your System","weight":0,"excerpt":"lorem-ipsum","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>The Node Package Manager (usually shortened to npm) and Node.js are popular technologies among JavaScript developers. npm is the default package management utility that is installed automatically on your machine when you download and install Node.js.</p>\n<p>npm assists in building, consuming, managing, and sharing small pieces of code. On the other hand, Node.js provides a server-side environment for creating powerful applications.</p>\n<p>However, at times, npm can get corrupted, become incompatible with other programs, or just experience performance issues. In such cases, it may help to reinstall npm on your system and save yourself the hassles.

However, if you want to experiment with things by using a version that will be released in the future, you can run the following:</p>\n<p>If you want to update Node.js to the latest version, <a href=\"https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog/update-node-js/\">you can read this article.</a></p>\n<h2>How to reinstall npm and Node.js on Windows</h2>\n<p>If the npm or Node.js running on your Windows environment is broken, you can reinstall and get the most out of them.</p>\n<p>You can use any of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reinstalling using a Node version manager</li>\n<li>Reinstalling using a Node installer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's talk about each of them.</p>\n<h3>a) Reinstalling using a Node version manager</h3>\n<p>A Node version manager is a tool you can use to install various versions of Node.js and npm and shift between them seamlessly.</p>\n<p>A popular Node version management tool you can use is <a href=\"https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/\">nvm-windows</a>. It's a powerful command line utility that allows you to manage multiple installations of Node.js comfortably.</p>\n<p>Before installing the utility, it is recommended to remove all the existing versions of Node.js and npm from your Windows computer. This will prevent any conflict issues when installing the software.</p>\n<p>You can uninstall them by doing the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the Windows Control Panel and uninstall the Node.js program.</li>\n<li>If any Node.js installation directories are still remaining, delete them. An example is C:\\Program Files\\mynodejs.</li>\n<li>If any npm install location is still remaining, delete it. An example is C:\\Users\\&#x3C;username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, once your system is clean, go to <a href=\"https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases\">this page</a> and download and run the latest nvm-windows installer. After it has been installed, you can start the Command Prompt or Powershell as an Administrator and use the tool to reinstall Node.js and npm.</p>\n<p>If you want to reinstall a specific Node.js version, you can run the following command:</p>\n<p>Let's say you want to reinstall Node.js version 12.18.0, you can run:</p>\n<p>If you want to reinstall the latest stable Node.js version, you can run:</p>\n<p>If you want to check the list of Node.js versions available for download, you can run:</p>\n<p>To use the installed Node.js version in your project, you can switch to it:</p>\n<h3>b) Reinstalling using a Node installer</h3>\n<p>Using the official Node installer is the easiest way to reinstall Node.js and npm on your Windows environment.</p>\n<p>To use this option, you can go to the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">Node.js download page</a> and reinstall the latest Node.js version.</p>\n<p>It is recommended to download the version labeled LTS (Long-term Supported) because it has been tested with npm. Although the version labeled Current comes with the latest features, it may be unstable and unreliable.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/wp-content/media/2020/09/12121.png\"></p>\n<p>After selecting the version you want to download, and clicking the Windows Installer option, the installation wizard will magically complete the installation process for you.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the installer will automatically overwrite your existing, malfunctioned Node.js version with a new one.</p>\n<h2>How to reinstall npm and Node.js on macOS</h2>\n<p>Before reinstalling Node.js and npm on your macOS system, you'll need to remove any previously installed versions.</p>\n<p>Here are some ways you can use to uninstall them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manually—this involves manually removing any references of Node and npm from your system. Unfortunately, this process is difficult since there may be several directories with Node resources. For example, you may need to delete the node executable and node_modules from /usr/local/lib, delete .npm from the home directory, and delete many other directories.</li>\n<li>Using a script—this involves running a script to uninstall Node.js and npm automatically from your macOS system. You can find a simple script to use <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/nicerobot/2697848\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a>—this package management utility lets you complete the uninstallation process fast and easily. You can run the following command:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, once your system is clean, you can use any of the following methods to reinstall Node.js and npm on macOS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reinstalling using a Node installer</li>\n<li>Reinstalling using Homebrew</li>\n<li>Reinstalling using a Node version manager</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's talk about each of them.</p>\n<h3>a) Reinstalling using a Node installer</h3>\n<p>To use the official Node installer for reinstalling the tools, go to the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">Node.js download page</a> and select the version you want to install—just as we described previously.</p>\n<p>Remember to choose the macOS installer option. If you run the installer, it will complete the reinstallation process for you automatically.</p>\n<h3>b) Reinstalling using Homebrew</h3>\n<p>To reinstall using Homebrew, just run the following command on the macOS terminal:</p>\n<h3>c) Reinstalling using a Node version manager</h3>\n<p>You can also reinstall the two tools using the <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\">nvm</a> Node version manager. Since the process for using nvm is the same for both macOS and Linux, we'll describe how to use it in the next section.</p>\n<h2>How to reinstall npm and Node.js on Linux</h2>\n<p>Just like in the previous cases, you'll need to remove any installed version of Node.js and npm before reinstalling them on a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>Here are some ways you can use to uninstall them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the apt package manager—you can remove Node.js by running the following command:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above command will delete the distro-stable version while retaining the configuration files for later use. However, if you intend to remove the package as well as its configuration files, run the following:</p>\n<p>Finally, you can delete any unused packages that were installed automatically with the deleted package:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using nvm—you can also use the nvm Node version manager to uninstall Node.js from your system. We'll illustrate how to do this in the next section.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, once your machine is clean, you can use any of the following methods to reinstall Node.js and npm on Linux:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reinstalling using a Node version manager</li>\n<li>Reinstalling using the apt package manager</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's talk about each of them.</p>\n<h3>a) Reinstalling using a Node version manager</h3>\n<p>As earlier mentioned, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/\">nvm</a> Node version manager to reinstall Node.js and npm on both macOS and Linux.</p>\n<p>To install the script-based tool, you can use either Wget or cURL.</p>\n<p>If using Wget, execute the following on the terminal:</p>\n<p>If using cURL, execute this:</p>\n<p>The above commands will install nvm version 0.35.0 on your system. Remember to check <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/releases\">the latest version</a> and refer to it accordingly on the command you want to run.</p>\n<p>To verify if it was installed successfully, run the following:</p>\n<p>If all went well, it would output nvm.</p>\n<p>After installing nvm, you can use it to reinstall Node.js on your system.</p>\n<p>Simply, execute the following command:</p>\n<p>To reinstall a specific Node.js version, run:</p>\n<p>For example, to reinstall Node.js version 12.18.0, execute:</p>\n<p>Once reinstallation is complete, you can set that Node.js version for use as the system-wide default version:</p>\n<p>Furthermore, you can check the list of Node.js versions available for download by executing the following:</p>\n<p>To remove a Node.js version that you've set up using nvm, start by establishing if the version is currently active on your system:</p>\n<p>If it is not actively running, execute the following to uninstall it:</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the version targeted for removal is the current active version, you'll need to deactivate nvm first:</p>\n<p>Then, you can use the above uninstall command to remove it from your system.</p>\n<h3>b) Reinstalling using the apt package manager</h3>\n<p>A simpler way to reinstall Node.js and npm on a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, is to use the apt package manager.</p>\n<p>To do so, you can start by refreshing your local package index:</p>\n<p>Then, reinstall the distro-stable Node.js version from the repositories:</p>\n<p>In most cases, this is all you need to get up and running with Node.js. Also, you may want to reinstall npm by running the following command:</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>That's how to reinstall npm and Node.js on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>\n<p>After completing the reinstallation, you'll avoid any performance issues that often arise from using malfunctioned versions of the technologies.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Node.js is a popular open-source, cross-platform server-side environment for building robust applications.

Updating using a Node version manager on macOS or Linux</h2>\n<p>A Node version manager is a utility that lets you install different Node.js versions and switch flawlessly between them on your machine. You can also use it to update your version of Node.js.</p>\n<p>On macOS or Linux, you can use either of the following Node version managers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nvm</li>\n<li>n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's talk about each of them.</p>\n<p>a) nvm</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\">nvm</a> is a script-based version manager for Node.js. To install it on macOS or Linux, you can use either Wget or cURL.</p>\n<p>For Wget, run the following command on the terminal:</p>\n<p>For cURL, run the following:</p>\n<p>The above commands assume that you're installing nvm version 0.35.3. So, you'll need to check <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/releases\">the latest version</a> before installing it on your machine.</p>\n<p>With these commands, you can clone the repository to ~/.nvm. This way, you can make changes to your bash profile, allowing you to access nvm system-wide.</p>\n<p>To confirm if the installation was successful, you can run the following command:</p>\n<p>If everything went well, it'd output nvm.</p>\n<p>Next, you can simply download and update to the latest Node.js version by running the following:</p>\n<p>Note that node refers to an alias of the latest Node.js version.</p>\n<p>You can also reference LTS versions in aliases as well as .nvmrc files using the notation lts/* for the most recent LTS releases.</p>\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n<p>If you want to install and upgrade to a specific version, you can run the following:</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to update Node.js to version 12.18.3, you can run:</p>\n<p>After the upgrade, you can set that version to be the default version to use throughout your system:</p>\n<p>You can see the list of installed Node.js versions by running this command:</p>\n<p>Also, you can see the list of versions available for installation by running this command:</p>\n<p>b) n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/n\">n</a> is another useful Node version manager you can use for updating Node.js on macOS and Linux.</p>\n<p>Since it's an <a href=\"https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog/updating-npm-packages/\">npm-based package</a>, if you already have Node.js available on your environment, you can simply install it by running this command:</p>\n<p>Then, to download and update to your desired Node.js version, execute the following:</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to update Node.js to version 12.18.3, you can run:</p>\n<p>To see a list of your downloaded Node.js versions, run n on its own:</p>\n<p>You can specify to update to the newest LTS version by running:</p>\n<p>You can also specify to update to the latest current version by running:</p>\n<p>You can specify to update to the newest LTS version by running:</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>2. Updating using a Node version manager on Windows</h2>\n<p>On Windows, you can use the following Node version manager:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nvm-windows</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's talk about it.</p>\n<p><strong>a) nvm-windows</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/\">nvm-windows</a> is a Node version management tool for the Windows operating system. While it's not the same as nvm, both tools share several usage similarities for Node.js version management.</p>\n<p>Before installing nvm-windows, it's recommended to uninstall any available Node.js versions from your machine. This will avoid potential conflict issues during installation.</p>\n<p>Next, you can download and run the latest <a href=\"https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases\">nvm-setup.zip</a> installer.</p>\n<p>Also, since the utility runs in an Admin shell, you'll need to begin the Command Prompt or Powershell as an Administrator before using it.</p>\n<p>If you want to install and upgrade to a specific version, you can run the following:</p>\n<p>You can specify to update to the newest LTS version by running:</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to update Node.js to version 12.18.3, you can run:</p>\n<p>After the upgrade, you can switch to that version:</p>\n<p>You can also specify to update to the latest stable Node.js version:</p>\n<p>You can see the list of installed Node.js versions by running this command:</p>\n<p>Also, you can see the list of versions available for download by running this command:</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>3. Updating using a Node installer on Linux</h2>\n<p>Using a Node installer is the least recommended way of upgrading Node.js on Linux. Nonetheless, if it's the only route you can use, then follow the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the official <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">Node.js downloads site</a>, which has different Linux binary packages, and select your preferred built-in installer or source code. You can choose either the LTS releases or the latest current releases.</li>\n<li>Download the binary package using your browser. Or, you can download it using the following Wget command on the terminal:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/wp-content/media/2020/08/node-js-linux.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the binary package using your browser. Or, you can download it using the following Wget command on the terminal:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember to change the version number on the Wget command depending on the one you want.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install the xz-utils utility using the following command:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This utility will be used for unpacking the binary package.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally, run the following command to unpack and install the binary package on usr/local:</li>\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>4. Updating using a Node installer on macOS and Windows</h2>\n<p>Another way of updating your Node.js on macOS and Windows is to go to the official <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">download site</a> and install the most recent version. This way, it'll overwrite your existing old version with the latest one.</p>\n<p>You can follow the following steps to update it using this method:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the Node.js download page, select either the LTS version or the latest current version.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/wp-content/media/2020/08/node-js-mac-windows.png\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Depending on your system, click either the Windows Installer option or the macOS installer option.</li>\n<li>Run the installation wizard. It will magically complete the installation process and upgrade your Node.js version by replacing it with the new, updated one.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5. Updating using Homebrew on macOS</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> is a popular package management utility for macOS.</p>\n<p>To use it for installing Node.js, run the following command on your macOS terminal:</p>\n<p>Later, if you'd like to update it, run the following commands:</p>\n<p>Furthermore, you can switch between installed Node.js versions:</p>"},{"url":"/docs/reference/how-to-kill-a-process/","relativePath":"docs/reference/how-to-kill-a-process.md","relativeDir":"docs/reference","base":"how-to-kill-a-process.md","name":"how-to-kill-a-process","frontmatter":{"title":"Kill a Process in Linux","weight":0,"excerpt":"Kill a Process in Linux","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>How to Kill a Process in Linux</h1>\n<p><strong><em>Learn how to kill errant processes in this tutorial.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Picture this: You've launched an application (be it from your favorite desktop menu or from the command line) and you start using that launched app, only to have it lock up on you, stop performing, or unexpectedly die. You try to run the app again, but it turns out the original never truly shut down completely.</p>\n<p>What do you do? You kill the process. But how? Believe it or not, your best bet most often lies within the command line. Thankfully, Linux has every tool necessary to empower you, the user, to kill an errant process. However, before you immediately launch that command to kill the process, you first have to know what the process is. How do you take care of this layered task? It's actually quite simple...once you know the tools at your disposal.</p>\n<p>Let me introduce you to said tools.</p>\n<p>The steps I'm going to outline will work on almost every Linux distribution, whether it is a desktop or a server. I will be dealing strictly with the command line, so open up your terminal and prepare to type.</p>\n<h3>Locating the process</h3>\n<p>The first step in killing the unresponsive process is locating it. There are two commands I use to locate a process: <em>top *and *ps</em>. Top is a tool every administrator should get to know. With <em>top</em>, you get a full listing of currently running process. From the command line, issue <em>top</em> to see a list of your running processes (Figure 1).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lcom.static.linuxfound.org/sites/lcom/files/killa.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1: The top command gives you plenty of information.</p>\n<p>From this list you will see some rather important information. Say, for example, Chrome has become unresponsive. According to our <em>top</em> display, we can discern there are four instances of chrome running with Process IDs (PID) 3827, 3919, 10764, and 11679. This information will be important to have with one particular method of killing the process.</p>\n<p>Although <em>top</em> is incredibly handy, it's not always the most efficient means of getting the information you need. Let's say you know the Chrome process is what you need to kill, and you don't want to have to glance through the real-time information offered by <em>top</em>. For that, you can make use of the <em>ps *command and filter the output through *grep</em>. The <em>ps</em> command reports a snapshot of a current process and <em>grep *prints lines matching a pattern. The reason why we filter *ps</em> through <em>grep</em> is simple: If you issue the <em>ps</em> command by itself, you will get a snapshot listing of all current processes. We only want the listing associated with Chrome. So this command would look like:</p>\n<p>ps aux | grep chrome</p>\n<p>The <em>aux</em> options are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a = show processes for all users</li>\n<li>u = display the process's user/owner</li>\n<li>x = also show processes not attached to a terminal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <em>x</em> option is important when you're hunting for information regarding a graphical application.</p>\n<p>When you issue the command above, you'll be given more information than you need (Figure 2) for the killing of a process, but it is sometimes more efficient than using top.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lcom.static.linuxfound.org/sites/lcom/files/killb.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2: Locating the necessary information with the ps command.</p>\n<h3>Killing the process</h3>\n<p>Now we come to the task of killing the process. We have two pieces of information that will help us kill the errant process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process name</li>\n<li>Process ID</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which you use will determine the command used for termination. There are two commands used to kill a process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>kill -- Kill a process by ID</li>\n<li>killall -- Kill a process by name</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also different signals that can be sent to both kill commands. What signal you send will be determined by what results you want from the kill command. For instance, you can send the HUP (hang up) signal to the kill command, which will effectively restart the process. This is always a wise choice when you need the process to immediately restart (such as in the case of a daemon). You can get a list of all the signals that can be sent to the kill command by issuing kill -l. You'll find quite a large number of signals (Figure 3).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lcom.static.linuxfound.org/sites/lcom/files/killc.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Figure 3: The available kill signals.</p>\n<p>The most common kill signals are:</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>Signal Name</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>Single Value</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>Effect</p>\n<p>|\n|</p>\n<p>SIGHUP</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>Hangup</p>\n<p>|\n|</p>\n<p>SIGINT</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>Interrupt from keyboard</p>\n<p>|\n|</p>\n<p>SIGKILL</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>9</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>Kill signal</p>\n<p>|\n|</p>\n<p>SIGTERM</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>15</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>Termination signal</p>\n<p>|\n|</p>\n<p>SIGSTOP</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>17, 19, 23</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>Stop the process</p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p>What's nice about this is that you can use the Signal Value in place of the Signal Name. So you don't have to memorize all of the names of the various signals.<br>\nSo, let's now use the *kill *command to kill our instance of chrome. The structure for this command would be:</p>\n<p>kill SIGNAL PID</p>\n<p>Where SIGNAL is the signal to be sent and PID is the Process ID to be killed. We already know, from our <em>ps</em> command that the IDs we want to kill are 3827, 3919, 10764, and 11679. So to send the kill signal, we'd issue the commands:</p>\n<p>kill -9 3827</p>\n<p>kill -9 3919</p>\n<p>kill -9 10764</p>\n<p>kill -9 11679</p>\n<p>Once we've issued the above commands, all of the chrome processes will have been successfully killed.</p>\n<p>Let's take the easy route! If we already know the process we want to kill is named chrome, we can make use of the *killall *command and send the same signal the process like so:</p>\n<p><em>killall -9 chrome</em></p>\n<p>The only caveat to the above command is that it may not catch all of the running chrome processes. If, after running the above command, you issue the ps aux|grep chrome command and see remaining processes running, your best bet is to go back to the *kill *command and send signal 9 to terminate the process by PID.</p>\n<h3>Ending processes made easy</h3>\n<p>As you can see, killing errant processes isn't nearly as challenging as you might have thought. When I wind up with a stubborn process, I tend to start off with the *killall *command as it is the most efficient route to termination. However, when you wind up with a really feisty process, the *kill *command is the way to go.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/reference/","relativePath":"docs/reference/index.md","relativeDir":"docs/reference","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Reference","weight":0,"excerpt":"helpful reference guides","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h1>Reference:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>[SITEMAP🗺🟈](<a href=\"https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/docs/sitemap/\">https://bgoonz-blog.netlify.app/docs/sitemap/</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bookmarks:</h1>\n<iframe src=\"https://bgoonz-bookmarks.netlify.app/\" height=\"1000px\" width=\"1400px\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"  frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n<h1>SearchAwesome:</h1>\n<iframe src=\"https://search-awesome.vercel.app/\" height=\"1000px\" width=\"1400px\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"  frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n<h1>Job Search:</h1>\n<iframe src=\"https://web-dev-collaborative.github.io/gitpod-job-search-html-static/\" height=\"1000px\" width=\"1400px\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"  frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>"},{"url":"/docs/reference/installing-node/","relativePath":"docs/reference/installing-node.md","relativeDir":"docs/reference","base":"installing-node.md","name":"installing-node","frontmatter":{"title":"Installing Node","weight":0,"excerpt":"Installing Node","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h2>Android<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#android\"></a></h2>\n<p>Android support is still experimental in Node.js, so precompiled binaries are not yet provided by Node.js developers.</p>\n<p>However, there are some third-party solutions.

It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!</p>\n<p>Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.</p>\n<p>A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.</p>\n<p>When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.</p>\n<p>This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.</p>\n<p>Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.</p>\n<p>In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://nodejs.dev/learn#a-vast-number-of-libraries\"></a>A Vast Number of Libraries</h2>\n<p>npm with its simple structure helped the ecosystem of Node.js proliferate, and now the npm registry hosts over 1,000,000 open source packages you can freely use.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://nodejs.dev/learn#an-example-nodejs-application\"></a>An Example Node.js Application</h2>\n<p>The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:</p>\n<p>This code first includes the Node.js <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html\"><code>http</code> module</a>.</p>\n<p>Node.js has a fantastic <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/\">standard library</a>, including first-class support for networking.</p>\n<p>The <code>createServer()</code> method of <code>http</code> creates a new HTTP server and returns it.</p>\n<p>The server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.</p>\n<p>Whenever a new request is received, the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_request\"><code>request</code> event</a> is called, providing two objects: a request (an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage\"><code>http.IncomingMessage</code></a> object) and a response (an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse\"><code>http.ServerResponse</code></a> object).</p>\n<p>Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.</p>\n<p>The first provides the request details. In this simple example, this is not used, but you could access the request headers and request data.</p>\n<p>The second is used to return data to the caller.</p>\n<p>In this case with:</p>\n<p>JScopy</p>\n<p>res.statusCode = 200</p>\n<p>we set the statusCode property to 200, to indicate a successful response.</p>\n<p>We set the Content-Type header:</p>\n<p>JScopy</p>\n<p>res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')</p>\n<p>and we close the response, adding the content as an argument to <code>end()</code>:</p>\n<p>JScopy</p>\n<p>res.end('Hello World\\n')</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://nodejs.dev/learn#nodejs-frameworks-and-tools\"></a>Node.js Frameworks and Tools</h2>\n<p>Node.js is a low-level platform.

That means if you are doing web development, you can use this language to perform some operating on the web page, like running some JavaScript code when a button is clicked by the user.</p>\n<p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language which means a variable can hold any data type like String or Number in its lifetime and JavaScript interpreter won't complain about it. It's single-threaded which means your JavaScript code runs synchronously or sequentially line by line. It's interpreted which means you don't need to compile your JavaScript code.</p>\n<p>JavaScript is interactive, which means you can directly feed JavaScript code to the interpreter and it will be executed immediately. You can try this by opening <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/\">DevTools</a> in the browser (_in Chrome, press _<code>*command** + **option** + **i*</code>) or right-click anywhere on the page and click inspect. Then go to the console tab, here you can type any valid JavaScript code and press enter to run it. Use <code>shift + enter</code> to add a new-line in your code.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*iSdHW-r4lmJ41vrpm_0lxQ.png\"></p>\n<p>(interacting with JavaScript interpreter)</p>\n<p>Every browser ships a JavaScript Interpreter also called a JavaScript Engine. <a href=\"https://v8.dev/\">V8</a> is the JavaScript engine designed by Google and used in the Google Chrome browser while <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey\">SpiderMonkey</a> is a JavaScript engine developed by Mozilla for their Firefox browser.</p>\n<p>Since JavaScript engine designed by every browser is different, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International\">ECMA</a> standardizes features of JavaScript. This standard is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript\">ECMAScript</a> (<em>pronounced as ek-ma-script</em>). Whenever ECMA adds a feature to this JavaScript standard, the browser has to add it in their JavaScript engine to stay in the competition (<em>though this process is very slow</em>).</p>\n<p>JavaScript is a very easy language to learn and fun to write. Every year, new features are added to ECMAScript which brings JavaScript one more step closer to dominate the planet. The latest major revision of JavaScript is <a href=\"http://es6-features.org/\">ES6</a> or ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015 which has dumped a ton of features to make it more fun to code in. At the moment, JavaScript supports the OOP paradigm very well and can be used in functional programming as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla\">Mozilla</a> is an open-source foundation that documents JavaScript very well on their developer documentation AKA <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">Mozilla Developer Network</a> or <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\">MDN</a>. It is one of the top online destinations to learn JavaScript, though there are other online resources as well. If you want to take a look at the JavaScript specifications and learn simple tutorials, visit <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\">MDN Documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>JavaScript is sometimes abbreviated as JS or .js/.JS (<em>dot J S</em>) to state that an entity is related to JavaScript, like Node.js or ReactJS or AngularJS. But in no ways, JavaScript is related to Java, or so you think 👻. If you need a history lesson about JavaScript and its evolution, watch this amazing video.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh6lK57Cuk4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh6lK57Cuk4</a></p>\n<p>Assuming that you are familiar with JavaScript and gained a good amount of knowledge, we can move forward. But if you don't know JavaScript at all, learn basic JavaScript from the MDN documentation I explained earlier. Because learning about Node.js without knowledge of JavaScript is like understanding web development without HTML.</p>\n<h1>What is server-side JavaScript?</h1>\n<p>JavaScript is a single-threaded language, it knows how to get things done one at a time. It can't do asynchronous tasks or run JavaScript code in multiple threads for efficiency. It just knows about JavaScript as defined in ECMAScript specification and nothing more.</p>\n<p>Since JavaScript is used on the web, it needs to be secure. Hence, using JavaScript, you can't access the computer it is running on, like File System, IO, Networking, etc. and neither ECMAScript has specifications for that.</p>\n<p>So it is up to the browser vendors to extend JavaScript engine with APIs that can do other things. For example, DOM API is responsible to print an HTML code into actual pixels on the screen, I have explained this process in <a href=\"https://itnext.io/how-the-browser-renders-a-web-page-dom-cssom-and-rendering-df10531c9969?source=your_stories_page---------------------------\">my Medium article</a>. Also, the <a href=\"https://javascript.info/xmlhttprequest\">XMLHttpRequest</a> API gives us the ability to send network requests to fetch data from a remote server in the background.</p>\n<p>These sorts of APIs are responsible to perform other operations that JavaScript is not designed to perform. These APIs are provided by the browser and they are called <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API\">Web APIs</a>. These APIs are written in some Low-Level languages like C or C++ but their interface is made available through JavaScript.</p>\n<p>These Web APIs sometimes do their job in separate thread allowing other JavaScript code to run normally while the job is running in the background. Once the job is done, it then informs the main JavaScript thread.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So through JavaScript, you are executing C++ code and returning result back to the JavaScript, that doesn't sound so difficult.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, <code>[setTimeout(callback, delay)](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp)</code> function is not part of ECMAScript specification, it is provided by the browser to perform an asynchronous operation. The <code>callback</code> function is executed in the main JavaScript thread once <code>delay</code> milliseconds has elapsed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/20/1*Lyq6NipNFEgLwjXs0-BDgA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/473/1*Lyq6NipNFEgLwjXs0-BDgA.png\"></p>\n<p>(an oversimplification of how JavaScript runs in a browser)</p>\n<p>So far we know that JavaScript is essential in a browser. But if you think about JavaScript engine alone, it can exist anywhere. You can take the V8 JavaScript engine and install it on your computer (<em>let's call it as a server</em>). With some fiddling, you can feed JavaScript code to it and it will run that code for you and may return the result. In theory, it looks pretty simple.</p>\n<p>The concept of server-side JavaScript comes from this simple idea. You can take any JavaScript engine, wrap inside an application that gives a clean interface to take the user's JavaScript code and execute it in the JavaScript engine. You can also provide APIs to perform operations like File System IO, Networking, etc. which do not run on JavaScript engine.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/20/1*i1b-kgRTc9KPvHjvBifoyA.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/473/1*i1b-kgRTc9KPvHjvBifoyA.png\"></p>\n<p>(an oversimplification of how JavaScript runs on a server)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl\">Ryan Dahl</a> took this idea and made Node.js.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To understand more about how a JavaScript engine works in a browser, you should read my article on <a href=\"https://itnext.io/how-javascript-works-in-browser-and-node-ab7d0d09ac2f\">How JavaScript engine works in browser and Node</a>. This article also explain concept of Web APIs in depth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>How Node.js works?</h1>\n<p>Sometimes, Node.js is also called simply Node or node.</p>\n<p>Node.js is a framework that contains the V8 JavaScript engine, the standard library of packages, and some binaries. In reality, it is more complex than that as explained in the below diagram (<em>follow the link for more details</em>).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/405/1*iTdvBPVxYZdJZQKsP3yILw.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36766696/which-is-correct-node-js-architecture\">Stackoverflow</a>)</p>\n<p>Like Web APIs in the browser, Node.js has a standard library that contains JavaScript packages (<em>we will learn about packages later</em>) which may also provide an interface to low-level APIs. For example, Node.js comes with <code>fs</code> package which contains <code>readFile</code> function among many. This function reads the file on the disk of the machine and returns file content back.</p>\n<p>Most of these packages contain code written in a low-level programming language to communicate with the device, like for file system access. These packages export JavaScript functions and other types to run this code. Since JavaScript can not talk to C++ or some other language, Node.js has to create a binding to facilitate this communication. The process to create such packages is very tricky, but it is explained <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/native-extensions-for-node-js-767e221b3d26\">here</a> in-depth.</p>\n<p>Node.js uses different threads to perform low-level non-JavaScript time-taking operations. This way, our JavaScript is not blocked while a time taking operation like reading a file is in progress. Since these operations are running in the background once initiated, we need a confirmation or a callback when the operation is finished. This callback is a JavaScript function that will execute as soon as the operation is finished.</p>\n<p>const fs = require('fs'); // fs is built-in packagefs.readFile('/path/to/file.txt', function(error, data){<br>\n// if error is not empty, show error log<br>\n// read data and do something with it<br>\n});</p>\n<p>The Node.js architecture is very complex and made of different parts as seen in the earlier diagram. It also contains an event loop that facilitates the execution of these callback functions. You should watch the below video on the event loop, though it is in the context of the browser but things are pretty similar in Node.js as well. This will clear your remaining doubts.</p>\n<h1>Installing Node.js</h1>\n<p>You should install Node.js from their official website at <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">nodejs.org</a>. If you are using Windows, Mac OS, or Linux, you can get precompiled binaries and installers. The best way to go is by using an installer.</p>\n<p>When you install Node.js, you get <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code> binaries added to your path. That means, now you can use <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code> command. We will talk about <code>npm</code> later, but for now, let's focus on the <code>node</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/459/1*jjZ-5MLgkPDNd-6j6x52rQ.png\"></p>\n<p>Using <code>-v</code> or <code>--version</code> flag, we can check the version of the Node installed. The latest node will have the latest V8 engine, hence latest JavaScript features. If you need the flexibility to change Node version at any given time, in that case, you should not install Node.js using above method. Instead, you should use Node Version Manager or <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\">NVM</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/\">Here</a> is the list of Node.js releases with V8 engine versions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like we saw in DevTools of the browser, using the simple command <code>node</code> will open a JavaScript interpreter in the terminal. This way we can run some simple JavaScript code to amuse yourself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/20/1*yfvMB7k2KBIylz_ISFUL-Q.png?q=20\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/459/1*yfvMB7k2KBIylz_ISFUL-Q.png\"></p>\n<p>(node interpreter)</p>\n<h1>Running JavaScript code with Node.js</h1>\n<p>Now that we have a good understanding of what Node.js is and how JavaScript engine works, we can start messing with it.</p>\n<p>Using an interpreter we can perform some basic arithmetics and other basic stuff. But most of the time, your actual JavaScript code will be in a <code>.js</code> file. Instead of giving one line at a time to the interpreter, we need to give whole file content at once. We can do that by using <code>node /path/to/file.js</code> command.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*UdmQcaaaqcGtbzgWUFtE2A.png\"></p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github.com/course-one/node-js-introduction/blob/master/hello-world.js\">hello-world.js</a>)</p>\n<p>In the above example, we have created <code>hello-world.js</code> file and it contains <code>hello</code> function. This function is executed after it was defined in the same file. Using the terminal, we executed <code>node ./hello-world.js</code> command. <code>node</code> will pick up <code>hello-world.js</code> file from the directory where the terminal is opened and run it using the V8 JavaScript engine.</p>\n<p>Since <code>node</code> can only execute <code>.js</code> files, adding <code>.js</code> extension to the file path is optional. If we provide a directory path instead of file path to <code>node</code>, Node.js will try to resolve <code>index.js</code> file inside that directory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*J1cd4WNICvBUcuDpUfvecA.png\"></p>\n<p>(executing index.js in the current directory with Node)</p>\n<h1>Importing scripts in the program</h1>\n<p>Normally our application is broken down to different parts. For example, if a set of functions are used over and over, we would like them to be contained in a separate file and import that file wherever those functions are to be used.</p>\n<p>Node.js supports this functionality natively. When you import a file inside another file, that file is called a module. Node.js uses the CommonJS module system syntax to import modules and packages.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Though <a href=\"https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/introduction-to-es6-modules-49956f580da\">ES6+</a> supports new module system, it is yet to be implemented in Node.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's create a <code>lib</code> directory and place <code>math.js</code> file inside it. This file contains some common math functions like <code>add</code> and <code>multiply</code>. We will import this file inside <code>calculate.js</code> file situated in the main directory. Hence <code>math.js</code> is a module, since we are importing it and not executing it directly with Node.</p>\n<p>To import a module, we need to use <code>require</code> function provided by the Node.js and available globally everywhere in the program. This function takes a relative or an absolute path of the module file and returns what module is exporting. Hence, we need to save it inside a variable.</p>\n<p>// calculate.js<br>\nvar math = require( './lib/math.js' ); // <code>.js</code> is optional</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>require()</code> statement sometimes also called as import statement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now let's take a look at <code>math.js</code> file. We need to provide AKA export some values to the <code>require()</code> function call. This is done using <code>exports</code> variable. This variable is also globally available everywhere.</p>\n<p>This variable is actually an object which is empty <code>{}</code> at the beginning. When we import this module using <code>require</code> function, this is the object <code>require()</code> call will return.</p>\n<p>// calculate.js<br>\nvar math = require( './lib/math' );console.log(math); // {}</p>\n<p>Since we know that <code>exports</code> is an object that will be exported from the module, we can stuff it with whatever we want. As objects go, an object is a collection of key-value pairs. So let's add some math functions to it.</p>\n<p>// lib/math.js// add <code>add</code> function to <code>exports</code><br>\nexports.add = function( num1, num2 ) {<br>\nreturn num1 + num2<br>\n};</p>\n<p>From <code>math</code> module, we are exporting <code>add</code> function which returns the sum of the two numbers (<em>arguments</em>). Let's see what <code>math</code> variable looks like.</p>\n<p>// calculate.js<br>\nvar math = require( './lib/math' );console.log(math);<br>\n{ add: [Function] }</p>\n<p>It shows that <code>math</code> variable is an object that contains <code>add</code> key which has a <code>Function</code> value. Let's execute that function and see the result.</p>\n<p>// calculate.js<br>\nvar math = require( './lib/math' );// add 1 + 2<br>\nvar result = math.add(1, 2);<br>\nconsole.log( result ); // 3</p>\n<h2>What the heck is module.exports then?</h2>\n<p>I kind of skipped over this part so that you can understand module import with ease. I have a simple question, what if my <code>math</code> module exports only one function like <code>add</code> but I don't want to export it inside an object. This is the only function my module is exporting, so I want <code>require()</code> call to return this function only so that I can start using it like below.</p>\n<p>// calculate.js<br>\nvar math = require( './lib/math' );// add 1 + 2<br>\nvar result = math(1, 2); // math is a function<br>\nconsole.log( result ); // 3</p>\n<p>This is where <code>module</code> global variable comes into the picture. Like <code>exports</code>, <code>module</code> is also globally available everywhere. <code>module</code> is an object and it contains information about module (<em>auto injected by Node.js in key-value pairs</em>). The important key in this object we should know about is <code>exports</code>.</p>\n<p><code>exports</code> variable inside a module points to <code>exports</code> property on the <code>module</code> object, as you can prove in the below test.</p>\n<p>// lib/math.js<br>\nconsole.log(exports === module.exports); // true</p>\n<p>That means when we were setting <code>exports.add</code>, we were actually setting <code>module.exports.add</code>. So if we want our module to export only one function, we can just assign <code>module.exports</code> to that function.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We could say that since <code>exports</code> and <code>module.exports</code> is the same, why not just set <code>exports</code> to the function. The reason is how objects are handled in JavaScript. Read <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/16383925\">this answer</a> to explore this topic in details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>// lib/math.js// export function only<br>\nmodule.exports = function( num1, num2 ) {<br>\nreturn num1 + num2<br>\n};</p>\n<p>If your module import path is a directory, then <code>require</code> function will resolve <code>index.js</code> file inside it. Using this feature, you can have multiple .<code>js</code> files in a directory that contains different exports and you can import them inside <code>index.js</code> to exports them again from a single point.</p>\n<p>└── lib/<br>\n├── index.js (import <code>math</code> and <code>graph</code> and export them)<br>\n├── math.js<br>\n└── graph.js</p>\n<p>This way, the importer does not need to target individual module files in a directory. The importer can just point to <code>index.js</code> file.</p>\n<p>// lib/math.js<br>\nexports.add = function( num1, num2 ) {<br>\nreturn num1 + num2<br>\n};// lib/index.js<br>\nvar math = require('./math');<br>\nexports.add = math.add<br>\n// calculate.js<br>\nconst lib = require('./lib'); // points to './lib/index.js'<br>\nlib.add(1, 2) // 3</p>\n<p>In Node.js, a module or a package is loaded only once (<em>per thread or session</em>) even when you <code>require()</code> them multiple times in the program. Once loaded, it will be cached by the Node for performance enhancement.</p>\n<p>There are other tricks with CommonJS module system and sometimes we also need to be careful. Read <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js/\">this article</a> to understand more about imports.</p>\n<h1>Packages in Node.js</h1>\n<p>A package is nothing but a directory that contains a bunch of modules. Like for example <code>lib</code> in our previous example can be called a package but not quite yet. The most important feature about a node package is that, from anywhere in the program, we should be able to import it, without providing a relative or an absolute path.</p>\n<p>Well, that sounds absurd. If our <code>.js</code> files are nested, the import path will also change. Let's say that, we have a <code>src</code> directory and it contains <code>compute.js</code>. If we need to import <code>lib</code> package, the import path will be <code>../lib</code>.</p>\n<p>├── lib/<br>\n| ├── index.js<br>\n| └── math.js<br>\n└── src/<br>\n├── compute.js // require( '../lib')<br>\n└── deep/<br>\n└── nested.js // require( '../../lib')</p>\n<p>As we nest our files deeper, the import path is very difficult to track. What would be easy is instead of the relative path, we would just use <code>lib</code> and Node.js just finds the path to that package for us.</p>\n<p>// src/compute.js<br>\nconst lib = require('lib'); // points to '../lib/index.js'<br>\nlib.add(1, 2) // 3</p>\n<p>This might sound like a fantasy but it is actually very real. Node.js can do this for us, just that we need to create <code>node_modules</code> directory and clone <code>lib</code> directory inside it. This way, when we call <code>require('lib')</code>, it will point to the <code>lib</code> directory inside <code>node_modules</code>. Now, <code>lib</code> is a package.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You might wonder, why they are called <code>node_modules</code> and not <code>node_packages</code>? In a conventional sense, a module is a file and package is a collection of modules. But when it comes to <code>require</code> function, they are ambiguous. Hence, let's stick to a common name, module. But normally, when people say node module, it is a package inside <code>node_modules</code> directory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the real question is, how does Node knows where the <code>node_modules</code> directory is. The answer is, it doesn't. When we import a package, it searches that package inside <code>node_modules</code> directory of the current file path (<em>where import statement is written</em>). If it doesn't find <code>node_modules</code> directory or the package directory, it performs a similar search in the parent directory.</p>\n<p>This continues until the last directory in the file system is reached. If it doesn't find the package, it throws <code>Error: Cannot find module 'lib'</code> error.</p>\n<p>Let's create <code>node_modules</code> directory in our project and clone <code>lib</code> directory there. From <code>src/compute.js</code>, we will call the <code>add</code> function as before.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*o2PkxJ468fIvuQaZojV-sw.png\"></p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github.com/course-one/node-js-introduction/tree/master/lib\">package introduction</a>)</p>\n<p>In the above example, we are importing <code>math.js</code> file from <code>lib</code> package. If we just use <code>require('lib')</code>, Node.js will point to <code>index.js</code> file inside <code>lib</code> package directory. If <code>math.js</code> is missing, <code>require</code> will try to resolve <code>math/index.js</code> file treating <code>math</code> as a directory.</p>\n<p>Even though packages seems easy, their management if done manually is very difficult. Like what if we needed a 3rd-party package? I mean, should we clone the remote source code and put it inside <code>node_module</code> directory manually? Do you know how hard that would be for multiple people in the team? And whenever package version changes, it would be a mess to update.</p>\n<p>This is where NPM comes into the picture.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This whole modules and packages theory might sound familiar to you if you are a python developer. But you don't need <strong>init</strong>.py like file in Node.js 😉</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>What is NPM?</h1>\n<p>When we installed Node.js, we also got <code>npm</code> command. <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">NPM</a> or <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">Node Package Manager</a> is the default package manager for Node.js. A role of a package manager is to download and install remote package, with ease.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BTW, we can also install packages from a local directory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Node.js has a wide community that develop good packages for everybody to use. For example, <code>lodash</code> is the package that is used widely. This package contains useful utility functions like <code>add</code> in our earlier example. These utility functions are very well documented on their <a href=\"https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15\">official website</a>.</p>\n<p>When we have a remote package in our project, it is called as a dependency since our project depends on it. We need to keep track of our dependencies or at least list them down somewhere. We list all our dependencies inside a <code>package.json</code> file which is a JSON file that contains some information about our project and dependencies it needs.</p>\n<p>This file is essential for NPM. To create this file using <code>npm</code>, use <code>npm init</code> command. This command will ask you some question to fill project-specific data in <code>package.json</code> and eventually create <code>package.json</code> file. You can bypass the questions using <code>-y</code> flag.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*QIqW9G-YXcvQAs0xl0zh2A.png\"></p>\n<p>(Initializing <a href=\"https://github.com/course-one/node-js-introduction/blob/master/package.json\">package.json</a>)</p>\n<p>Note <code>dependencies</code> section in the <code>package.json</code> file, it is empty at the moment. This means, our project at the moment does not depend on any of the remote packages.</p>\n<p>To install a package, we use <code>npm install &#x3C;packagename></code> command. For example, to install <code>lodash</code> package, we use <code>npm install --save lodash</code> command. Using <code>--save</code> flag, we can make entry of this package inside <code>dependencies</code> section of the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>\n<p>This command will do the following things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At first, it searches for this package on <code>[registry.npm.com](http://registry.npmjs.org/)</code> which contains the database of all packages. You can see the documentation of a package by visiting <code>[https://www.npmjs.com/package/&#x3C;packagename>](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)</code> URL.</li>\n<li>Then it downloads the compressed zip (<em>or tar</em>) file that contains all the source code of the package. If a version of the package was not specified in the command, it will download the latest version.</li>\n<li>Then it adds the package entry to the <code>dependencies</code> section of <code>package.json</code> with the version of the package. If the entry of the package already exists, it will just override the version of the package downloaded.</li>\n<li>Then it creates <code>node_modules</code> folder in the same directory if it doesn't already exist.</li>\n<li>Then it will copy all the files from the downloaded compressed file in the directory with the name of the package inside <code>node_modules</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's actually install <code>lodash</code> package and see how <code>node_modules</code> and <code>package.json</code> file looks like after the install.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*xPtGu4bjhl4YJlH9PvwH9A.png\"></p>\n<p>(npm install -- save lodash)</p>\n<p>From the above example, <code>npm</code> installed the version <code>4.17.15</code> of the <code>lodash</code>. This type of version number system is called as <a href=\"https://devhints.io/semver\">Semantic Versioning</a>. We can also specify a specific version of a package to install using the command like <code>npm install --save lodash@4.17.10</code>.</p>\n<p>Now that we have installed <code>lodash</code>, let's use its <code>_.toUpper</code> function to change the case of a string. But first, we need to import the package.</p>\n<p>// src/transform.js<br>\nvar lodash = require( 'lodash' );var result = lodash.toUpper( 'hello world!' );<br>\nconsole.log( result ); // HELLO WORLD!</p>\n<p>When we run this file using the command <code>node src/transform.js</code>, we get <code>HELLO WORLD!</code> printed in the terminal.</p>\n<p>When you install a package, NPM also creates <code>package-lock.json</code> file if not already present. This file contains a list of dependency packages with their versions that your project has installed as well as dependencies of those packages (<em>because a package might use other packages and so on</em>). This file including <code>package.json</code> should be tracked by your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control\">VCS</a> while <code>node_module</code> directory should be ignored (<em>reasons explained later</em>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NPM and package management is far more sophisticated (and for good) than this but we will discuss it later in details.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Built-in Packages AKA Built-in Modules</h1>\n<p>Node.js ships with a collection of built-in packages called as a Node Standard Library. These packages are essential to perform low-level operations like File System I/O and Networking. We do not have to install them using NPM.</p>\n<p>Since these packages contain code in a low-level programming language tailored to a specific version of Node.js, they have to be shipped as a part of the installation process. <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/index.html\">Here</a> is a list of built-in modules in Node.js.</p>\n<p>These packages do not exist on disk like <code>lodash</code>. They are compiled into low-level or intermediate stuff (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/42892065\">explained here</a>) but their sources are listed <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/master/lib\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><code>[fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)</code> package is used to perform File System operations like file read and write while <code>[path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html)</code> package is used to resolve a file or directory path on the system. Let's use these packages to demonstrate a cool example.</p>\n<p>├── res<br>\n| └── hello-world.txt<br>\n└── fs-example.js</p>\n<p>According to the above project structure, we have <code>hello-world.txt</code> file which contains <code>Hello World!</code> text. Using <code>fs-example.js</code>, we want to read the text in the file and log in to the console.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*78ejxNXflo4CGZ18gRXPhQ.png\"></p>\n<p>(Sample <code>fs</code> and <code>path</code> module introduction)</p>\n<p>In the above program, we imported the <code>fs</code> and <code>path</code> built-in modules.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When we <code>require(name)</code> a package, Node.js first searches for the package <code>name</code> in the built-in packages. If it doesn't find it in the standard library, then it searches for it in <code>node_modules</code> as explained earlier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>__dirname</code> is a globally available variable that resolves to the absolute path of the current file on the disk. <code>[path.resolve](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_resolve_paths)</code> function takes multiple path segments and joins them. This is a safe way to create an absolute path of a file on the disk, as Windows and Unix systems use different path delimiter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can also use a relative path like <code>var filePath = './res/hello-world.txt';</code> in the above example but <code>path.resolve</code> is safer. <code>process</code> is a globally available object that contains information about environment variables and current process context in general. Unlike <code>__dirname</code>, <code>[process.cwd()](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_cwd)</code> function returns the path of the directory from where the <code>node</code> command was executed in the terminal (or the current directory in the terminal).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's talk about the example in detail. Inside <code>fs-example.js</code> file, we imported built-in modules <code>fs</code> and <code>path</code>. Then we constructed a <code>filePath</code> which points to <code>hello-world.txt</code> on the disk.</p>\n<p><code>[fs.readFile](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_path_options_callback)</code> function takes below arguments in series</p>\n<ol>\n<li>filePath: A absolute or relative path to the file we are trying to read.</li>\n<li>options: An object that contains a configuration about reading. In the above example, we set <code>encoding</code> to <code>utf-8</code> which converts binary data to Text format. This will convert file content to Text.</li>\n<li>callback: Sync file read operation using <code>readFile</code> function is asynchronous, we need a callback function to execute when the file is read completely. This function will receive read error (<em>if any</em>) as the first argument and file data as the second argument.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notice the console log. The first <code>-end-of-the-program-</code> statement got printed as <code>fs.readFile</code> was reading the file in the background. Once file reading was completed, the callback function was called.</p>\n<p>Node.js can also perform synchronous (blocking) operations. For example, using <code>[fs.readFileSync](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfilesync_path_options)</code>, we can block the JavaScript thread until the file is read. This way, we can make sure, JavaScript code run sequentially.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*FmUCo0e0Cs_QKxEGZ509nQ.png\"></p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github.com/course-one/node-js-introduction/blob/master/fs-example.js\">Reading a file synchronously</a>)</p>\n<h1>Creating an HTTP server in Node.js</h1>\n<p>Node.js can do anything, literally anything. Node.js has built-in <code>[http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html)</code> module as well as <code>[https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html)</code> module to create an HTTP/HTTPS server. But their implementation is kind of hard.</p>\n<p>ExpressJS is a 3rd-party package that wraps the built-in <code>http</code> module and provide a cleaner interface to create an HTTP server. This package is listed on NPM registry under <code>[express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)</code> name. Let's create a basic HTTP server.</p>\n<p>First, we need to install <code>express</code> package using NPM.</p>\n<p>npm install --save express</p>\n<p>Then we will import this package and create a basic HTTP server inside <code>server.js</code> file. We will follow their <a href=\"https://github.com/expressjs/express\">startup documentation</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*6yP5kysrs9UIKk8RYnR0AQ.png\"></p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github.com/course-one/node-js-introduction/blob/master/server.js\">Sample express HTTP server</a>)</p>\n<p>When we executed <code>server.js</code> file with <code>node</code>, ExpressJS will lock the Node process as we want the server to be running forever. Now that server is running on the port <code>9000</code>, we can open the browser and access URL <code>&#x3C;http://localhost:9000/></code> which will execute the <code>.get</code> callback.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/473/1*evvJp-ynknMqnUTbW4dssw.png\"></p>\n<p><code>(&#x3C;http://localhost:9000/>)</code></p>\n<p>This was just a basic example of how we can create an HTTP server in Node.js. But with express.js, we can create more complex servers which can send HTML file content using <code>response.sendFile(filePath)</code> function or send JSON using <code>response.json(object)</code> function. We can also create an endpoint that <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html\">serves static files</a> like images from the disk using <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html\">middlewares</a>.</p>\n<p>To stop the server, we need to stop the locked Node.js process. We can do that by pressing <code>ctrl+c</code> in the terminal. But what if we need to actually run the server on the production literally forever. In that case, we can't have terminal open for years. This is where the process managers comes in.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pm2.keymetrics.io/\">PM2</a> is one of the best process managers that can run a Node process in the background. When you install it, it will give you a clean command-line interface to start a Node.js process and PM2 will monitor it.</p>\n<h1>Execute a Bash command from Node.js</h1>\n<p>If you make Node.js your life and want to do everything from Node, then this topic is very important. Let's say that from a JavaScript program, you want to execute a BASH command. A Bash command would be <code>echo Hello World!</code>. You can try this command in the terminal and it will print <code>Hello World!</code>.</p>\n<p>Node.js provides a built-in <code>[child_process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html)</code> command to run Bash command in a separate process. <code>[child_process.exec](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback)</code> function takes a Bash command and executes it. It takes an optional callback function to execute (<em>with some process information</em>) when the process is terminated.</p>\n<p>Let's create a <code>echo.js</code> file that executes <code>echo Hello World!</code> Bash command.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/675/1*NGwvmLnmj436x2EXbWAJvg.png\"></p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://github.com/course-one/node-js-introduction/blob/master/echo.js\">child_process example</a>)</p>\n<p>In the above program, the callback function to <code>child_process.exec</code> receives the <a href=\"https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/stdout.htm\">standard output</a> of the program.</p>\n<p><code>child_process</code> module can do many things, like execute a Bash file using <code>[child_process.execFile](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback)</code> function. It also supports synchronous variants to run a bash command synchronously, like <code>[child_process.execSync](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_execsync_command_options)</code> function.</p>\n<h1>How to ship your code to Production?</h1>\n<p>Now that we have a good understanding of Node.js and NPM, we can move forward to this most important topic.</p>\n<p><code>package.json</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code> files are very important as they contain information about dependencies our project has. Those dependencies are stored inside <code>node_modules</code> directory by the NPM.</p>\n<p>So if our project is managed using a VCS like Git then should we commit all our code? The answer is, 😱 NOOOOOOOOOOO. <code>node_modules</code> directory can be very large as it contains deeply nested dependencies. Hence it should be ignored by the VCS. Use <code>.gitignore</code> file to do that.</p>\n<h1>.gitignore\\</h1>\n<p>node_modules</p>\n<p>But then when your buddy takes the clone or a pull of the project, he/she won't get <code>node_modules</code>. Nothing to worry about here because NPM can take care of that.</p>\n<p>When we used <code>npm install &#x3C;packagename></code> command for the first time, NPM created <code>node_modules</code> directory and install <code>packagename</code> package. Using <code>npm install</code> command (<em>without a package name</em>), NPM will look at <code>pakage.json</code> to install all the dependencies listed inside it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Actually, since NPM v.5, <code>npm install</code> command looks at <code>package-lock.json</code> command to install the dependencies since it contains the exact versions of the packages and their dependencies (which were installed by the developer of the project).

Indenting by 4 spaces is consistent with code blocks\nand simpler for editors to implement. Additionally, this can be a compatibility\nissue for multi-markdown parsers, which require 4-space indents.

rule reports a violation for the following document:</p>\n<!-- markdownlint-disable code-block-style -->\n<pre><code>Some text.\n\n    # Indented code\n\nMore text.\n\n```ruby\n# Fenced code\n```\n\nMore text.\n</code></pre>\n<!-- markdownlint-restore -->\n<p>To fix violations of this rule, use a consistent style (either indenting or code\nfences).</p>\n<p>The specified style can be specific (<code>fenced</code>, <code>indented</code>) or simply require\nthat usage be consistent within the document (<code>consistent</code>).</p>\n<p>Rationale: Consistent formatting makes it

However, many renderers -- like Github's and <em>Markdown Here</em> -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. <em>Markdown Here</em> supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the <a href=\"http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html\">highlight.js demo page</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-no-highlight\">Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inline <code>code</code> has <code>back-ticks around</code> it.</p>\n<p>Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces.

This can be by one or more sets of column values. In most scenarios it is a single column, such as employeeID.</p>\n<p>Every relational table has one primary key. Its purpose is to uniquely identify each row in the database. No two rows can have the same primary key value. The practical result of this is that you can select every single row by just knowing its primary key.</p>\n<p>SQL Server UNIQUE constraints allow you to ensure that the data stored in a column, or a group of columns, is unique among the rows in a table.</p>\n<p>Although both UNIQUE and <a href=\"https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-primary-key/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">PRIMARY KEY</a> constraints enforce the uniqueness of data, you should use the UNIQUE constraint instead of PRIMARY KEY constraint when you want to enforce the uniqueness of a column, or a group of columns, that are not the primary key columns.</p>\n<p>Different from PRIMARY KEY constraints, UNIQUE constraints allow NULL. Moreover, UNIQUE constraints treat the NULL as a regular value, therefore, it only allows one NULL per column.</p>\n<figure><img

That happens because sort works only with the English language.</p>\n<p>See the next example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// Spanish\n['único', 'árbol', 'cosas', 'fútbol'].sort();\n// [\"cosas\", \"fútbol\", \"árbol\", \"único\"] // bad order\n\n// German\n['Woche', 'wöchentlich', 'wäre', 'Wann'].sort();\n// [\"Wann\", \"Woche\", \"wäre\", \"wöchentlich\"] // bad order\n</code></pre>\n<p>Fortunately, there are two ways to overcome this behavior <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare\">localeCompare</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Collator\">Intl.Collator</a> provided by ECMAScript Internationalization API.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Both methods have their own custom parameters in order to configure it to work adequately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Using <code>localeCompare()</code></h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">['único', 'árbol', 'cosas', 'fútbol'].sort(function (a, b) {\n    return a.localeCompare(b);\n});\n// [\"árbol\", \"cosas\", \"fútbol\", \"único\"]\n\n['Woche', 'wöchentlich', 'wäre', 'Wann'].sort(function (a, b) {\n    return a.localeCompare(b);\n});\n// [\"Wann\", \"wäre\", \"Woche\", \"wöchentlich\"]\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Using <code>Intl.Collator()</code></h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">['único', 'árbol', 'cosas', 'fútbol'].sort(Intl.Collator().compare);\n// [\"árbol\", \"cosas\", \"fútbol\", \"único\"]\n\n['Woche', 'wöchentlich', 'wäre', 'Wann'].sort(Intl.Collator().compare);\n// [\"Wann\", \"wäre\", \"Woche\", \"wöchentlich\"]\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>For each method you can customize the location.</li>\n<li>According to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare#Performance\">Firefox</a> Intl.Collator is faster when comparing large numbers of strings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So when you are working with arrays of strings in a language other than English, remember to use this method to avoid unexpected sorting.</p>"},{"url":"/docs/tools/Archive/","relativePath":"docs/tools/Archive.md","relativeDir":"docs/tools","base":"Archive.md","name":"Archive","frontmatter":{"title":"Archive","weight":0,"excerpt":"more tools that I have created or collaborated on.","seo":{"title":"","description":"embeded developer tools and utilities","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h1> Archive</h1>\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://resourcerepo2.netlify.app/\" height=\"1000px\" width=\"1400px\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"  frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n <iframe  style=\"z-index:-1!important;

It is easier to do this from the command line. So we need to install a linux unzip utility.\n In the Ubuntu terminal type: `sudo apt install unzip` and press Enter\n Mocha.js\nTest if you have Mocha.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `which mocha`. If it prints a path, then you're good. Otherwise, if it prints nothing, install Mocha.js by typing `npm install -g mocha`.\n### Python 3\nUbuntu does not come with Python 3. Install it using the command `sudo apt install python3`. Test it by typing `python3 --version` and seeing it print a number.\n### Note about WSL\nAs of the time of writing of this document, WSL has an issue renaming or deleting files if Visual Studio Code is open. So before doing any linux commands which manipulate files, make sure you **close** Visual Studio Code before running those commands in the Ubuntu terminal.\n### Some other common instillations\n    # Installing build essentials\n    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev\n    # Nodejs and NVM\n    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash\n    source ~/.profile\n    sudo nvm install 7.10.0\n    sudo nvm use 7.10.0\n    node -v\n    #nodemon\n    sudo npm install -g nodemon\n    sudo npm install -g loopback-cli\n    # Forever to run nodejs scripts forever\n    sudo npm install forever -g\n    # Git - a version control system\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install -y git xclip\n    # Grunt - an automated task runner\n    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli\n    # Bower - a dependency manager\n    sudo npm install -g bower\n    # Yeoman - for generators\n    sudo npm install -g yo\n    # maven\n    sudo apt-get install maven -y\n    # Gulp - an automated task runner\n    sudo npm install -g gulp-cli\n    # Angular FullStack - My favorite MEAN boilerplate (MEAN = MongoDB, Express, Angularjs, Nodejs)\n    sudo npm install -g generator-angular-fullstack\n    # Vim, Curl, Python - Some random useful stuff\n    sudo apt-get install -y vim curl python-software-properties\n    sudo apt-get install -y python-dev, python-pip\n    sudo apt-get install -y libkrb5-dev\n    # Installing JDK and JRE\n    sudo apt-get install -y default-jre\n    sudo apt-get install -y default-jdk\n    # Archive Extractors\n    sudo apt-get install -y unace unrar zip unzip p7zip-full p7zip-rar sharutils rar uudeview mpack arj cabextract file-roller\n    # FileZilla - a FTP client\n    sudo apt-get install -y filezilla\n#### If you found this guide helpful feel free to checkout my github/gists where I host similar content:\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">bgoonz's gists · GitHub</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor\" title=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\"><strong>bgoonz - Overview</strong><br />\n<em>Web Developer, Electrical Engineer JavaScript | CSS | Bootstrap | Python | React | Node.js | Express | Sequelize…</em>github.com</a><a href=\"https://github.com/bgoonz\" class=\"js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock\"></a>"},{"url":"/docs/tutorials/","relativePath":"docs/tutorials/index.md","relativeDir":"docs/tutorials","base":"index.md","name":"index","frontmatter":{"title":"Tutorials","weight":0,"excerpt":"Walkthroughs of various development activities and skills","seo":{"title":"","description":"","robots":[],"extra":[]},"template":"docs"},"html":"<p>This section is dedicated to coding walkthroughs:</p>"},{"url":"/docs/articles/node-api-express/","relativePath":"docs/articles/node-api-express.md","relativeDir":"docs/articles","base":"node-api-express.md","name":"node-api-express","frontmatter":{"title":"Node APIs With Express","sections":[],"seo":{"title":" Node APIs With Express","description":"Review-Of-Previous-Concepts","robots":[],"extra":[],"type":"stackbit_page_meta"},"template":"docs"},"html":"<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p><code>REST</code> is a generally agreed-upon set of principles and constraints.

Like <strong>primary keys</strong>, they are most often integers that identify (rather than store) data. However, whereas a primary key is used to id rows in a table, foreign keys are used to connect a record in one table to a record in a second table.</p>\n<h3>Follow Along</h3>\n<p>Consider the following <code>farms</code> and <code>ranchers</code> tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/b88ebcd8fa3a4fa3a36cf99c939f6067\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/a4ccaec69c484ce0bcd03d2e8a83e489\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>The <code>farm_id</code> in the <code>ranchers</code> table is an example of a <code>foreign key</code>. Each entry in the <code>farm_id</code> (foreign key) column corresponds to an <code>id</code> (primary key) in the <code>farms</code> table. This allows us to track which farm each rancher belongs to while keeping the tables normalized.</p>\n<p>If we could only see the <code>ranchers</code> table, we would know that John, Jane, and Jen all work together and that Jim and Jay also work together. However, to know where any of them work, we would need to look at the <code>farms</code> table.</p>\n<h3>Challenge</h3>\n<p>Open <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_op_in\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">SQLTryIT (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<p>How many records in the products table belong to the category “confections”?</p>\n<h3>Objective 2 — query data from multiple tables</h3>\n<p>Now that we understand the basics of querying data from a single table, let's move on to selecting data from multiple tables using JOIN operations.</p>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>We can use a <code>JOIN</code> to combine query data from multiple tables using a single <code>SELECT</code> statement.</p>\n<p>There are different types of joins; some are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"9c7e\">inner joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"7cd3\">outer joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"96e6\">left joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"0e55\">right joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"d582\">cross joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"6716\">non-equality joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"b7f0\">self joins.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using <code>joins</code> requires that the two tables of interest contain at least one field with shared information. For example, if a <em>departments</em> table has an <em>id</em> field, and an employee table has a <em>department</em>id_ field, and the values that exist in the <em>id</em> column of the <em>departments</em> table live in the <em>department</em>id_ field of the employee table, we can use those fields to join both tables like so:</p>\n<pre><code>select * from employees\njoin departments on employees.department_id = departments.id\n</code></pre>\n<p>This query will return the data from both tables for every instance where the <code>ON</code> condition is true. If there are employees with no value for department<em>id or where the value stored in the field does not correspond to an existing id in the</em> departments <em>table, then that record will NOT be returned. In a similar fashion, any records from the</em> departments <em>table that don't have an employee associated with them will also be omitted from the results. Basically, if the</em> id* does not show as the value of department_id for an employee, it won't be able to join.</p>\n<p>We can shorten the condition by giving the table names an alias. This is a common practice. Below is the same example using aliases, picking which fields to return and sorting the results:</p>\n<pre><code>select d.id, d.name, e.id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary\nfrom employees as e\njoin departments as d\n  on e.department_id = d.id\norder by d.name, e.last_name\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that we can take advantage of white space and indentation to make queries more readable.</p>\n<p>There are several ways of writing joins, but the one shown here should work on all database management systems and avoid some pitfalls, so we recommend it.</p>\n<p>The syntax for performing a similar join using Knex is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>db('employees as e')\n  .join('departments as d', 'e.department_id', 'd.id')\n  .select('d.id', 'd.name', 'e.first_name', 'e.last_name', 'e.salary')\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Follow Along</h3>\n<p>A good explanation of how the different types of joins can be seen <a href=\"https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/sql-joins.php\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">in this article from w3resource.com (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<h3>Challenge</h3>\n<p>Use <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/tryit.asp?filename=trysql_select_top\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">this online tool (Links to an external site.)</a> to write the following queries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"9ccf\">list the products, including their category name.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"b07f\">list the products, including the supplier name.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"7b08\">list the products, including both the category name and supplier name.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is SQL Joins?</h3>\n<p>An SQL JOIN clause combines rows from two or more tables. It creates a set of rows in a temporary table.</p>\n<h3>How to Join two tables in SQL?</h3>\n<p>A JOIN works on two or more tables if they have at least one common field and have a relationship between them.</p>\n<p>JOIN keeps the base tables (structure and data) unchanged.</p>\n<h3>Join vs. Subquery</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"eeea\">JOINs are faster than a subquery and it is very rare that the opposite.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"3b2e\">In JOINs the RDBMS calculates an execution plan, that can predict, what data should be loaded and how much it will take to processed and as a result this process save some times, unlike the subquery there is no pre-process calculation and run all the queries and load all their data to do the processing.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"84ce\">A JOIN is checked conditions first and then put it into table and displays; where as a subquery take separate temp table internally and checking condition.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"3002\">When joins are using, there should be connection between two or more than two tables and each table has a relation with other while subquery means query inside another query, has no need to relation, it works on columns and conditions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SQL JOINS: EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN</h3>\n<p>The are two types of SQL JOINS — EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"31e6\">SQL EQUI JOIN :</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The SQL EQUI JOIN is a simple SQL join uses the equal sign(=) as the comparison operator for the condition. It has two types — SQL Outer join and SQL Inner join.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"d86b\">SQL NON EQUI JOIN :</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <strong>SQL NON EQUI JOIN</strong> is a join uses comparison operator other than the equal sign like >, &#x3C;, >=, &#x3C;= with the condition.</p>\n<p><strong>SQL EQUI JOIN : INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN</strong></p>\n<p>The SQL EQUI JOIN can be classified into two types — INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"c9b5\">SQL INNER JOIN</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This type of EQUI JOIN returns all rows from tables where the key record of one table is equal to the key records of another table.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"6bc6\">SQL OUTER JOIN</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This type of EQUI JOIN returns all rows from one table and only those rows from the secondary table where the joined condition is satisfying i.e. the columns are equal in both tables.</p>\n<p>In order to perform a JOIN query, the required information we need are:</p>\n<p><strong>a)</strong> The name of the tables<strong>b)</strong> Name of the columns of two or more tables, based on which a condition will perform.</p>\n<p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>FROM table1\njoin_type table2\n[ON (join_condition)]\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>\n<p><a

database logic exists in separate, modular methods. These files containing database access helpers are often called <strong>models</strong></p>\n<h3>Follow Along</h3>\n<p>To handle CRUD operations for a single resource, we would want to create a <strong>model</strong> (or database access file) containing the following methods:</p>\n<pre><code>function find() {\n}\n\nfunction findById(id) {\n}\n\nfunction add(user) {\n}\n\nfunction update(changes, id) {\n}\n\nfunction remove(id) {\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each of these functions would use Knex logic to perform the necessary database operation.</p>\n<pre><code>function find() {\n  return db('users');\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>For each method, we can choose what value to return. For example, we may prefer <code>findById()</code> to return a single <code>user</code> object rather than an array.</p>\n<pre><code>function findById(id) {\n// first() returns the first entry in the db matching the query\n  return db('users').where({ id }).first();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can also use existing methods like <code>findById()</code> to help <code>add()</code> return the new user (instead of just the id).</p>\n<pre><code>function add(user) {\n  db('users').insert(user)\n    .then(ids => {\n      return findById(ids[0]);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once all methods are written as desired, we can export them like so:</p>\n<pre><code>module.exports = {\n  find,\n  findById,\n  add,\n  update,\n  delete,\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>…and use the helpers in our endpoints</p>\n<pre><code>const User = require('./user-model.js');\n\nrouter.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  User.find()\n    .then(users => {\n      res.json(users);\n    })\n    .catch(&#x26;nbsp;err => {});\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>There should no be <code>knex</code> code in the endpoints themselves.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>### A database is a collection of data organized for easy retrieval and manipulation.\n<p>We're concerned only with digital databases, those that run on computers or other electronic devices. Digital databases have been around since the 1960s. Relational databases, those which store “related” data, are the oldest and most common type of database in use today.</p>\n<h3>Data Persistence</h3>\n<p>A database is often necessary because our application or code requires data persistence. This term refers to data that is infrequently accessed and not likely to be modified. In less technical terms, the information will be safely stored and remain untouched unless intentionally modified.</p>\n<p>A familiar example of non-persistent data would be JavaScript objects and arrays, which reset each time the code runs.</p>\n<h3>Relational Databases</h3>\n<p>In relational databases, <strong>the data is stored in tabular format grouped into rows and columns</strong> (similar to spreadsheets). A collection of rows is called a table. Each row represents a single record in the table and is made up of one or more columns.</p>\n<p>These kinds of databases are relational because a <em>relation</em> is a mathematical idea equivalent to a table. So relational databases are databases that store their data in tables.</p>\n<h3>Tables</h3>\n<p><strong>Below are some basic facts about tables:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tables organize data in rows and columns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each row in a table represents one distinct record.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each column represents a field or attribute that is common to all the records.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fields should have a descriptive name and a data type appropriate for the attribute it represents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tables usually have more rows than columns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tables have primary keys that uniquely identify each row.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Foreign keys represent the relationships with other tables.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7ZPYzWNRcs2PBL6p.jpg\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>### SQL:\n<p>SQL is a standard language, which means that it almost certainly will be supported, no matter how your database is managed. That said, be aware that the SQL language can vary depending on database management tools. This lesson focuses on a set of core commands that never change. Learning the standard commands is an excellent introduction since the knowledge transfers between database products.</p>\n<p>The syntax for SQL is English-like and requires fewer symbols than programming languages like C, Java, and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>It is declarative and concise, which means there is a lot less to learn to use it effectively.</p>\n<p>When learning SQL, it is helpful to understand that each command is designed for a different purpose. If we classify the commands by purpose, we'll end up with the following sub-categories of SQL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"aba8\"><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong>: used to modify database objects. Some examples are: <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, <code>ALTER TABLE</code>, and <code>DROP TABLE</code>.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"4f3f\"><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong>: used to manipulate the data stored in the database. Some examples are: <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>DELETE</code>.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"e1f2\"><strong>Data Query Language (DQL)</strong>: used to ask questions about the data stored in the database. The most commonly used SQL command is <code>SELECT</code>, and it falls in this category.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"4474\"><strong>Data Control Language (DCL)</strong>: used to manage database security and user's access to data. These commands fall into the realm of Database Administrators. Some examples are <code>GRANT</code> and <code>REVOKE</code>.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"921b\"><strong>Transaction Control Commands</strong>: used for managing groups of statements that must execute as a unit or not execute at all. Examples are <code>COMMIT</code> and <code>ROLLBACK</code>.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a developer, you'll need to get familiar with DDL and become proficient using DML and DQL. This lesson will cover only DML and DQL commands.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>The four SQL operations covered in this section will allow a user to **query**, **insert**, and **modify** a database table.\n<h3>Query</h3>\n<p>A <strong>query</strong> is a SQL statement used to retrieve data from a database. The command used to write queries is <code>SELECT</code>, and it is one of the most commonly used SQL commands.</p>\n<p>The basic syntax for a <code>SELECT</code> statement is this:</p>\n<pre><code>select &#x3C;selection> from &#x3C;table name>;\n</code></pre>\n<p>To see all the fields on a table, we can use a <code>*</code> as the <code>selection</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>select * from employees;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The preceding statement would show all the records and all the columns for each record in the <code>employees</code> table.</p>\n<p>To pick the fields we want to see, we use a comma-separated list:</p>\n<pre><code>select first_name, last_name, salary from employees;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The return of that statement would hold all records from the listed fields.</p>\n<p>We can extend the <code>SELECT</code> command's capabilities using <code>clauses</code> for things like filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.</p>\n<p>It is possible to query multiple tables in a single query. But, in this section, we only perform queries on a single table. We will cover performing queries on multiple tables in another section.</p>\n<h3>Insert</h3>\n<p>To <strong>insert</strong> new data into a table, we'll use the <code>INSERT</code> command. The basic syntax for an <code>INSERT</code> statement is this:</p>\n<pre><code>insert into &#x3C;table name> (&#x3C;selection>) values (&#x3C;values>)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using this formula, we can specify which values will be inserted into which fields like so:</p>\n<pre><code>insert into Customers (Country, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode)\nvalues ('USA', 'WebDev School', 'Austen Allred', '1 WebDev Court', 'Provo', '84601');\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Modify</h3>\n<p><strong>Modifying</strong> a database consists of updating and removing records. For these operations, we'll use <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> commands, respectively.</p>\n<p>The basic syntax for an <code>UPDATE</code> statement is:</p>\n<pre><code>update &#x3C;table name> set &#x3C;field> = &#x3C;value> where &#x3C;condition>;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The basic syntax for a <code>DELETE</code> statement is:</p>\n<pre><code>delete from &#x3C;table name> where &#x3C;condition>;\n</code></pre>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>### Filtering results using WHERE clause\n<p>When querying a database, the default result will be every entry in the given table. However, often, we are looking for a specific record or a set of records that meets certain criteria.</p>\n<p>A <code>WHERE</code> clause can help in both cases.</p>\n<p>Here's an example where we might only want to find customers living in Berlin.</p>\n<pre><code>select City, CustomerName, ContactName\nfrom Customers\nwhere City = 'Berlin'\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can also chain together <code>WHERE</code> clauses using <code>OR</code> and <code>AND</code> to limit our results further.</p>\n<p>The following query includes only records that match both criteria.</p>\n<pre><code>select City, CustomerName, ContactName\nfrom Customers\nwhere Country = 'France' and City = 'Paris'\n</code></pre>\n<p>And this query includes records that match either criteria.</p>\n<pre><code>select City, CustomerName, ContactName\nfrom Customers\nwhere Country = 'France' or City = 'Paris'\n</code></pre>\n<p>These operators can be combined and grouped with parentheses to add complex selection logic. They behave similarly to what you're used to in programming languages.</p>\n<p>You can read more about SQLite operators from <a href=\"https://www.w3resource.com/sqlite/operators.php\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">w3resource (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<p>To select a single record, we can use a <code>WHERE</code> statement with a uniquely identifying field, like an id:</p>\n<pre><code>select * from Customers\nwhere CustomerId=3;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Other comparison operators also work in <code>WHERE</code> conditions, such as <code>></code>, <code>&#x3C;</code>, <code>&#x3C;=</code>, and <code>>=</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>select * from employees where salary >= 50000\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Ordering results using the ORDER BY clause</h3>\n<p>Query results are shown in the same order the data was inserted. To control how the data is sorted, we can use the <code>ORDER BY</code> clause. Let's see an example.</p>\n<pre><code>-- sorts the results first by salary in descending order, then by the last name in ascending order\nselect * from employees order by salary desc, last_name;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can pass a list of field names to <code>order by</code> and optionally choose <code>asc</code> or <code>desc</code> for the sort direction. The default is <code>asc</code>, so it doesn't need to be specified.</p>\n<p>Some SQL engines also support using field abbreviations when sorting.</p>\n<pre><code>select name, salary, department from employees order by 3, 2 desc;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, the results are sorted by the department in ascending order first and then by salary in descending order. The numbers refer to the fields' position in the <em>selection</em> portion of the query, so <code>1</code> would be <em>name</em>, <code>2</code> would be <em>salary</em>, and so on.</p>\n<p>Note that the <code>WHERE</code> clause should come after the <code>FROM</code> clause. The <code>ORDER BY</code> clause always goes last.</p>\n<pre><code>select * from employees where salary > 50000 order by last_name;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Limiting results using the LIMIT clause</h3>\n<p>When we wish to see only a limited number of records, we can use a <code>LIMIT</code> clause.</p>\n<p>The following returns the first ten records in the products table:</p>\n<pre><code>select * from products\nlimit 10\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>LIMIT</code> clauses are often used in conjunction with <code>ORDER BY</code>. The following shows us the five cheapest products:</p>\n<pre><code>select * from products\norder by price desc\nlimit 5\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Inserting data using INSERT</h3>\n<p>An insert statement adds a new record to the database. All non-null fields must be listed out in the same order as their values. Some fields, like ids and timestamps, may be auto-generated and do not need to be included in an <code>INSERT</code> statement.</p>\n<pre><code>-- we can add fields in any order; the values need to be in the same ordinal position\n-- the id will be assigned automatically\n  insert into Customers (Country, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode)\n  values ('USA', 'WebDev School', 'Austen Allred', '1 WebDev Court', 'Provo', '84601');\n</code></pre>\n<p>The values in an insert statement must not violate any restrictions and constraints that the database has in place, such as expected datatypes. We will learn more about constraints and schema design in a later section.</p>\n<h3>Modifying recording using UPDATE</h3>\n<p>When modifying a record, we identify a single record or a set of records to update using a <code>WHERE</code> clause. Then we can set the new value(s) in place.</p>\n<pre><code>update Customers\nset City = 'Silicon Valley', Country = 'USA'\nwhere CustomerName = 'WebDev School'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Technically the <code>WHERE</code> clause is not required, but leaving it off would result in every record within the table receiving the update.</p>\n<h3>Removing records using DELETE</h3>\n<p>When removing a record or set of records, we need only identify which record(s) to remove using a <code>WHERE</code> clause:</p>\n<pre><code>delete from Customers\nwhere CustomerName = 'WebDev School`;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once again, the <code>WHERE</code> clause is not required, but leaving it off would remove every record in the table, so it's essential.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>Raw SQL is a critical baseline skill. However, Node developers generally use an **Object Relational Mapper (ORM)** or **query builder** to write database commands in a backend codebase. Both **ORMs** and **query builders** are JavaScript libraries that allow us to interface with the database using a JavaScript version of the SQL language.\n<p>For example, instead of a raw SQL <code>SELECT</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>SELECT * FROM users;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We could use a query builder to write the same logic in JavaScript:</p>\n<pre><code>db.select('*').from('users');\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Query builders</strong> are lightweight and easy to get off the ground, whereas <strong>ORMs</strong> use an object-oriented model and provide more heavy lifting within their rigid structure.</p>\n<p>We will use a <strong>query builder</strong> called <a href=\"https://knexjs.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">knex.js (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>### Knex Setup\n<p>To use Knex in a repository, we'll need to add two libraries:</p>\n<pre><code>npm install knex sqlite3\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>knex</code> is our query builder library, and <code>sqlite3</code> allows us to interface with a <code>sqlite</code> database. We'll learn more about <code>sqlite</code> and other <strong>database management systems</strong> in the following module. For now, know that you need both libraries.</p>\n<p>Next, we use Knex to set up a config file:</p>\n<pre><code>const knex = require('knex');\n\nconst config = {\n  client: 'sqlite3',\n  connection: {\n    filename: './data/posts.db3',\n  },\n  useNullAsDefault: true,\n};\n\nmodule.exports = knex(config);\n</code></pre>\n<p>To use the query builder elsewhere in our code, we need to call <code>knex</code> and pass in a <code>config</code> object. We'll be discussing Knex configuration more in a future module. Still, we only need the <code>client</code>, <code>connection</code>, and <code>useNullAsDefault</code> keys as shown above. The <code>filename</code> should point towards the pre-existing database file, which can be recognized by the <code>.db3</code> extension.</p>\n<p><strong>GOTCHA</strong>: The file path to the database should be with respect to the <strong>root</strong> of the repo, not the configuration file itself.</p>\n<p>Once Knex is configured, we can import the above config file anywhere in our codebase to access the database.</p>\n<pre><code>const db = require('../data/db-config.js);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>db</code> object provides methods that allow us to begin building queries.</p>\n<h3>SELECT using Knex</h3>\n<p>In Knex, the equivalent of <code>SELECT * FROM users</code> is:</p>\n<pre><code>db.select('*').from('users');\n</code></pre>\n<p>There's a simpler way to write the same command:</p>\n<pre><code>db('users');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using this, we could write a <code>GET</code> endpoint.</p>\n<pre><code>router.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {\n  db('users')\n  .then(users => {\n    res.json(users);\n  })\n  .catch (err => {\n    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to get users' });\n  });\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: All Knex queries return promises.</p>\n<p>Knex also allows for a where clause. In Knex, we could write <code>SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1</code> as</p>\n<pre><code>db('users').where({ id: 1 });\n</code></pre>\n<p>This method will resolve to an array containing a single entry like so: <code>[{ id: 1, name: 'bill' }]</code>.</p>\n<p>Using this, we might add a <code>GET</code> endpoint where a specific user:</p>\n<pre><code>server.get('api/users/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const { id } = req.params;\n\ndb('users').where({ id })\n  .then(users => {\n    // we must check the length to find our if our user exists\n    if (users.length) {\n      res.json(users);\n    } else {\n      res.status(404).json({ message: 'Could not find user with given id.' })\n   })\n  .catch (err => {\n    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to get user' });\n  });\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h3>INSERT using Knex</h3>\n<p>In Knex, the equivalent of <code>INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Eva', 32)</code> is:</p>\n<pre><code>db('users').insert({ name: 'Eva', age: 32 });\n</code></pre>\n<p>The insert method in Knex will resolve to an array containing the newly created id for that user like so: <code>[3]</code>.</p>\n<h3>UPDATE using Knex</h3>\n<p>In knex, the equivalent of <code>UPDATE users SET name='Ava', age=33 WHERE id=3;</code> is:</p>\n<pre><code>db('users').where({ id: 3 })\n.update({name: 'Ava', age: 33 });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the <code>where</code> method comes before <code>update</code>, unlike in SQL.</p>\n<p>Update will resolve to a count of rows updated.</p>\n<h3>DELETE using Knex</h3>\n<p>In Knex, the equivalent of <code>DELETE FROM users WHERE age=33;</code> is:</p>\n<pre><code>db('users').where({ age: 33}).del();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once again, the <code>where</code> must come before the <code>del</code>. This method will resolve to a count of records removed.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>###\n<h3>Here's a small project you can practice with.</h3>\n<p>SQLlite Studio is an application that allows us to create, open, view, and modify SQLite databases. To fully understand what SQLite Studio is and how it works, we must also understand the concept of the Database Management Systems (DBMS).</p>\n<h3>What is a DBMS?</h3>\n<p>To manage digital databases we use specialized software called <strong>D</strong>ata<strong>B</strong>ase <strong>M</strong>anagement <strong>S</strong>ystems (DBMS). These systems typically run on servers and are managed by <strong>D</strong>ata<strong>B</strong>ase <strong>A</strong>dministrators (DBAs).</p>\n<p>In less technical terms, we need a type of software that will allow us to create, access, and generally manage our databases. In the world of relational databases, we specifically use Relational Database Mangement Systems (RDBMs). Some examples are Postgres, SQLite, MySQL, and Oracle.</p>\n<p>Choosing a DBMS determines everything from how you set up your database, to where and how the data is stored, to what SQL commands you can use. Most systems share the core of the SQL language that you've already learned.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can expect <code>SELECT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>WHERE</code> , and the like to be the same across all DBMSs, but the subtleties of the language may vary.</p>\n<h3>What is SQLite?</h3>\n<p><strong>SQLite</strong> is the DBMS, as the name suggests, it is a more lightweight system and thus easier to get set up than some others.</p>\n<p>SQLite allows us to store databases as single files. SQLite projects have a <code>.db3</code> extension. That is the database.</p>\n<p>SQLite is <em>not a database</em> (like relational, graph, or document are databases) but rather <em>a database management system</em>.</p>\n<h3>Opening an existing database in SQLite Studio</h3>\n<p>One useful visual interface we might use with a SQLite database is called <strong>SQLite Studio</strong>. <a href=\"https://sqlitestudio.pl/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Install SQLITE Studio here. (Links to an external site.)</a></p>\n<p>Once installed, we can use SQLite Studio to open any <code>.db3</code> file from a previous lesson. We may view the tables, view the data, and even make changes to the database.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed look at SQLite Studio, follow along in the video above.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>A **database schema** is the shape of our database. It defines what tables we'll have, which columns should exist within the tables and any restrictions on each column.\n<p>A well-designed database schema keeps the data well organized and can help ensure high-quality data.</p>\n<p>Note that while schema design is usually left to Database Administrators (DBAs), understanding schema helps when designing APIs and database logic. And in a smaller team, this step may fall on the developer.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>For a look at schema design in SQLite Studio, follow along in the video above.\n<p>When designing a single table, we need to ask three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"2e1a\">What fields (or columns) are present?</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"52e7\">What type of data do we expect for each field?</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"8aff\">Are there other restrictions needed for each column?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the following schema diagram for an <code>accounts</code> table, we can the answer to each other those questions:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/9790405dda624818822293a383eec2d2\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<h3>Table Fields</h3>\n<p>Choosing which fields to include in a table is relatively straight forward. What information needs to be tracked regarding this resource? In the real world, this is determined by the intended use of the product or app.</p>\n<p>However, this is one requirement every table should satisfy: a <strong>primary key</strong>. A primary key is a way to identify each entry in the database uniquely. It is most often represented as a auto-incrementing integer called <code>id</code> or <code>[tablename]Id</code>.</p>\n<h3>Datatypes</h3>\n<p>Each field must also have a specified datatype. The datatype available depends on our DBMS. Some supported datatype in SQLite include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"92fb\"><strong>Null:</strong> Missing or unknown information.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"32ef\"><strong>Integer:</strong> Whole numbers.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"181d\"><strong>Real:</strong> Any number, including decimals.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"ebce\"><strong>Text:</strong> Character data.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"c00e\"><strong>Blob:</strong> a large binary object that can be used to store miscellaneous data.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any data inserted into the table must match the datatypes determined in schema design.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Beyond datatypes, we may add additional <strong>constraints</strong> on each field. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"14ca\"><strong>Not Null:</strong> The field cannot be left empty</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"b533\"><strong>Unique:</strong> No two records can have the same value in this field</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"f0c4\"><strong>Primary key:</strong> — Indicates this field is the primary key. Both the not null and unique constraints will be enforced.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"f116\"><strong>Default:</strong> — Sets a default value if none is provided.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with data types, any data that does not satisfy the schema constraints will be rejected from the database.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>### Multi-Table Design\n<p>Another critical component of schema design is to understand how different tables relate to each other.

Install knex globally with <code>npm install -g knex</code>.</p>\n<p>This allows you to use Knex commands within any repo that has <code>knex</code> as a local dependency. If you have any issues with this global install, you can use the <code>npx knex</code> command instead.</p>\n<h3>Initializing Knex</h3>\n<p>To start, add the <code>knex</code> and <code>sqlite3</code> libraries to your repository.</p>\n<p><code>npm install knex sqlite3</code></p>\n<p>We've seen how to use manually create a config object to get started with Knex, but the best practice is to use the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>knex init\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, if Knex isn't globally installed:</p>\n<pre><code>npx knex init\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command will generate a file in your root folder called <code>knexfile.js</code>. It will be auto populated with three config objects, based on different environments. We can delete all except for the development object.</p>\n<pre><code>module.exports = {\n\ndevelopment: {\n    client: 'sqlite3',\n    connection: {\n      filename: './dev.sqlite3'\n    }\n  }\n\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>We'll need to update the location (or desired location) of the database as well as add the <code>useNullAsDefault</code> option. The latter option prevents crashes when working with <code>sqlite3</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>module.exports = {\n\ndevelopment: {\n    // our DBMS driver\n    client: 'sqlite3',\n    // the location of our db\n    connection: {\n      filename: './data/database_file.db3',\n    },\n    // necessary when using sqlite3\n    useNullAsDefault: true\n  }\n\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, wherever we configure our database, we may use the following syntax instead of hardcoding in a config object.</p>\n<pre><code>const knex = require('knex');\n\nconst config = require('../knexfile.js');\n\n// we must select the development object from our knexfile\nconst db = knex(config.development);\n\n// export for use in codebase\nmodule.exports = db;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Knex Migrations</h3>\n<p>Once our <code>knexfile</code> is set up, we can begin creating <strong>migrations</strong>.

Within the <code>up</code> function, we write the ended database changes. Within the <code>down</code> function, we write the code to undo the <code>up</code> functions. This allows us to undo any changes made to the schema if necessary.</p>\n<pre><code>exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {\n  // don't forget the return statement\n  return knex.schema.createTable('accounts', tbl => {\n    // creates a primary key called id\n    tbl.increments();\n    // creates a text field called name which is both required and unique\n    tbl.text('name', 128).unique().notNullable();\n    // creates a numeric field called budget which is required\n    tbl.decimal('budget').notNullable();\n  });\n};\n\nexports.down = function(knex, Promise) {\n  // drops the entire table\n  return knex.schema.dropTableIfExists('accounts');\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>References for these methods are found in the <strong>schema builder</strong> section of the <a href=\"https://knexjs.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Knex docs (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, the table is <strong>not</strong> yet created. To run this (and any other) migrations, use the command:</p>\n<p><code>knex migrate:latest</code></p>\n<p>Note if the database does not exist, this command will auto-generate one. We can use SQLite Studio to confirm that the accounts table has been created.</p>\n<h3>Changes and Rollbacks</h3>\n<p>If later down the road, we realize you need to update your schema, you shouldn't edit the migration file. Instead, you will want to create a new migration with the command:</p>\n<p><code>knex migrate:make accounts-schema-update</code></p>\n<p>Once we've written our updates into this file we save and close with:</p>\n<p><code>knex migrate:latest</code></p>\n<p>If we migrate our database and then quickly realize something isn't right, we can edit the migration file.

Like <strong>primary keys</strong>, they are most often integers that identify (rather than store) data. However, whereas a primary key is used to id rows in a table, foreign keys are used to connect a record in one table to a record in a second table.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>Consider the following <code>farms</code> and <code>ranchers</code> tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/5b20c5e233dd4a70a33d6ab2c2e1c8bb\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/0b0a909c24a9474fb9df80938546f12a\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>The <code>farm_id</code> in the <code>ranchers</code> table is an example of a <code>foreign key</code>. Each entry in the <code>farm_id</code> (foreign key) column corresponds to an <code>id</code> (primary key) in the <code>farms</code> table. This allows us to track which farm each rancher belongs to while keeping the tables normalized.</p>\n<p>If we could only see the <code>ranchers</code> table, we would know that John, Jane, and Jen all work together and that Jim and Jay also work together. However, to know where any of them work, we would need to look at the <code>farms</code> table.</p>\n<p>Now that we understand the basics of querying data from a single table, let's move on to selecting data from multiple tables using JOIN operations.</p>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>We can use a <code>JOIN</code> to combine query data from multiple tables using a single <code>SELECT</code> statement.</p>\n<p>There are different types of joins; some are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"d886\">inner joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"43f5\">outer joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"882e\">left joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"ad86\">right joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"4d8b\">cross joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"eb21\">non-equality joins.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"fc6a\">self joins.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using <code>joins</code> requires that the two tables of interest contain at least one field with shared information. For example, if a <em>departments</em> table has an <em>id</em> field, and an employee table has a <em>department</em>id_ field, and the values that exist in the <em>id</em> column of the <em>departments</em> table live in the <em>department</em>id_ field of the employee table, we can use those fields to join both tables like so:</p>\n<pre><code>select * from employees\njoin departments on employees.department_id = departments.id\n</code></pre>\n<p>This query will return the data from both tables for every instance where the <code>ON</code> condition is true. If there are employees with no value for department<em>id or where the value stored in the field does not correspond to an existing id in the</em> departments <em>table, then that record will NOT be returned. In a similar fashion, any records from the</em> departments <em>table that don't have an employee associated with them will also be omitted from the results. Basically, if the</em> id* does not show as the value of department_id for an employee, it won't be able to join.</p>\n<p>We can shorten the condition by giving the table names an alias. This is a common practice. Below is the same example using aliases, picking which fields to return and sorting the results:</p>\n<pre><code>select d.id, d.name, e.id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary\nfrom employees as e\njoin departments as d\n  on e.department_id = d.id\norder by d.name, e.last_name\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that we can take advantage of white space and indentation to make queries more readable.</p>\n<p>There are several ways of writing joins, but the one shown here should work on all database management systems and avoid some pitfalls, so we recommend it.</p>\n<p>The syntax for performing a similar join using Knex is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>db('employees as e')\n  .join('departments as d', 'e.department_id', 'd.id')\n  .select('d.id', 'd.name', 'e.first_name', 'e.last_name', 'e.salary')\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Follow Along</h3>\n<p>A good explanation of how the different types of joins can be seen <a href=\"https://www.w3resource.com/sql/joins/sql-joins.php\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">in this article from w3resource.com (Links to an external site.)</a>.</p>\n<h3>What is SQL Joins?</h3>\n<p>An SQL JOIN clause combines rows from two or more tables. It creates a set of rows in a temporary table.</p>\n<h3>How to Join two tables in SQL?</h3>\n<p>A JOIN works on two or more tables if they have at least one common field and have a relationship between them.</p>\n<p>JOIN keeps the base tables (structure and data) unchanged.</p>\n<h3>Join vs. Subquery</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"6fdc\">JOINs are faster than a subquery and it is very rare that the opposite.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"c648\">In JOINs the RDBMS calculates an execution plan, that can predict, what data should be loaded and how much it will take to processed and as a result this process save some times, unlike the subquery there is no pre-process calculation and run all the queries and load all their data to do the processing.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"d59c\">A JOIN is checked conditions first and then put it into table and displays; where as a subquery take separate temp table internally and checking condition.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"08ff\">When joins are using, there should be connection between two or more than two tables and each table has a relation with other while subquery means query inside another query, has no need to relation, it works on columns and conditions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>SQL JOINS: EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN</h3>\n<p>The are two types of SQL JOINS — EQUI JOIN and NON EQUI JOIN</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"2bb1\">SQL EQUI JOIN :</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The SQL EQUI JOIN is a simple SQL join uses the equal sign(=) as the comparison operator for the condition.

For example, we may prefer <code>findById()</code> to return a single <code>user</code> object rather than an array.</p>\n<pre><code>function findById(id) {\n// first() returns the first entry in the db matching the query\n  return db('users').where({ id }).first();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can also use existing methods like <code>findById()</code> to help <code>add()</code> return the new user (instead of just the id).</p>\n<pre><code>function add(user) {\n  db('users').insert(user)\n    .then(ids => {\n      return findById(ids[0]);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once all methods are written as desired, we can export them like so:</p>\n<pre><code>module.exports = {\n  find,\n  findById,\n  add,\n  update,\n  delete,\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>…and use the helpers in our endpoints</p>\n<pre><code>const User = require('./user-model.js');\n\nrouter.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  User.find()\n    .then(users => {\n      res.json(users);\n    })\n    .catch(&#x26;nbsp;err => {});\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>There should no be <code>knex</code> code in the endpoints themselves.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>###\n<p><code>Normalization</code> is the process of designing or refactoring database tables for maximum consistency and minimum redundancy.</p>\n<p>With objects, we're used to <em>denormalized</em> data, stored with ease of use and speed in mind. Non-normalized tables are considered ineffective in relational databases.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p><strong>Data normalization</strong> is a deep topic in database design. To begin thinking about it, we'll explore a few basic guidelines and some data examples that violate these rules.</p>\n<h3>Normalization Guidelines</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each record has a primary key.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No fields are repeated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All fields relate directly to the key data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each field entry contains a single data point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are no redundant entries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Denormalized Data</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/19a01f68a659470fb85bbe6906fb4bad\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>This table has two issues. There is no proper id field (as multiple farms may have the same name), and multiple fields are representing the same type of data: animals.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/075ad6dd99ac48698625d7b56ca67bef\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>While we have now eliminated the first two issues, we now have multiple entries in one field, separated by commas. This isn't good either, as its another example of denormalization. There is no “array” data type in a relational database, so each field must contain only one data point.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/375a15b0cb3f444a8698cd6cb3a08fe0\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>Now we've solved the multiple fields issue, but we created repeating data (the farm field), which is also an example of denormalization. As well, we can see that if we were tracking additional ranch information (such as annual revenue), that field is only vaguely related to the animal information.</p>\n<p><strong>When these issues begin arising in your schema design, it means that you should separate information into two or more tables.</strong></p>\n<h3>Anomalies</h3>\n<p>Obeying the above guidelines prevent <strong>anomalies</strong> in your database when inserting, updating, or deleting. For example, imagine if the revenue of Beech Ranch changed. With our denormalized schema, it may get updated in some records but not others:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/e05f5b2e8ff141798adc6f188f56f31e\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>Similarly, if Beech Ranch shut down, there would be three (if not more) records that needed to be deleted to remove a single farm.</p>\n<p>Thus a denormalized table opens the door for contradictory, confusing, and unusable data.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>What issues does the following table have?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/2793e8f6b70a47f48f9208779366e69e\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>There are three types of relationships:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One to one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One to many.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many to many.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Determining how data is related can provide a set of guidelines for table representation and guides the use of foreign keys to connect said tables.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>One to One Relationships</h3>\n<p>Imagine we are storing the financial projections for a series of farms.</p>\n<p>We may wish to attach fields like farm name, address, description, projected revenue, and projected expenses. We could divide these fields into two categories: information related to the farm directly (name, address, description) and information related to the financial projections (revenue, expenses).</p>\n<p>We would say that <code>farms</code> and <code>projections</code> have a <strong>one-to-one</strong> relationship. This is to say that every farm has exactly one projection, and every project corresponds to exactly one farm.</p>\n<p>This data can be represented in two tables: <code>farms</code> and <code>projections</code></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/944e594f3464473ea06383bfdea13265\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/de32fcf6760e45f284707274433fee92\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>The <code>farm_id</code> is the foreign key that links <code>farms</code> and <code>projections</code> together.</p>\n<p>Notes about one-to-one relationships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"198d\">The foreign key should always have a <code>unique</code> constraint to prevent duplicate entries. In the example above, we wouldn't want to allow multiple projections records for one farm.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"25c6\">The foreign key can be in either table. For example, we may have had a <code>projection_id</code> in the <code>farms</code> table instead. A good rule of thumb is to put the foreign key in whichever table is more auxiliary to the other.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"960d\">You can represent one-to-one data in a single table <em>without</em> creating anomalies. However, it is sometimes prudent to use two tables as shown above to keep separate concerns in separate tables.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>One to Many Relationships</h3>\n<p>Now imagine, we are storing the full-time ranchers employed at each farm. In this case, each rancher would only work at one farm however, each farm may have multiple ranchers.</p>\n<p>This is called a <strong>one-to-many</strong> relationship.</p>\n<p>This is the most common type of relationship between entities. Some other examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"5627\">One <code>customer</code> can have many <code>orders</code>.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"cc42\">One <code>user</code> can have many <code>posts</code>.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"dae3\">One <code>post</code> can have many <code>comments</code>.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Manage this type of relationship by adding a foreign key on the “many” table of the relationship that points to the primary key on the “one” table. Consider the <code>farms</code> and <code>ranchers</code> tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/7dfd2e69c9804a01845f2e9b716a5ac2\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/c95f3d418db94ab4b4532eeba0e4f918\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>In a many-to-many relationship, the foreign key (in this case <code>farm_id</code>) should <em>not</em> be unique.</p>\n<h3>Many to Many Relationships</h3>\n<p>If we want to track animals on a farm as well, we must explore the <strong>many-to-many</strong> relationship. A farm has multiple animals, and multiple of each type of animal is present at multiple different farms.</p>\n<p>Some other examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"d757\">an <code>order</code> can have many <code>products</code> and the same <code>product</code> will appear in many <code>orders</code>.</span></li>\n<li><span id=\"0256\">a <code>book</code> can have more than one <code>author</code>, and an <code>author</code> can write more than one <code>book</code>.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>To model this relationship, we need to introduce an <strong>intermediary table</strong> that holds foreign keys that reference the primary key on the related tables. We now have a <code>farms</code>, <code>animals</code>, and <code>farm_animals</code> table.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/3269812d7c2a4578b1a9f6bc27e485b1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/c2642c7f632f489cb1b9639c80b8400d\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/d0b0042c5e104edd9ed55e122af89084\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\">Untitled</a></p>\n<p>While each foreign key on the intermediary table is not unique, the combinations of keys should be unique.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9xpwm_56lgvHkFTKsmoMqg.gif\" class=\"graf-image\" /></figure>The Knex query builder library also allows us to create multi-table schemas include foreign keys. However, there are a few extra things to keep in mind when designing a multi-table schema, such as using the correct order when creating tables, dropping tables, seeding data, and removing data.\n<p>We have to consider the way that <code>delete</code> and <code>updates</code> through our API will impact related data.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Foreign Key Setup</h3>\n<p>In Knex, foreign key restrictions don't automatically work. Whenever using foreign keys in your schema, add the following code to your <code>knexfile</code>. This will prevent users from entering bad data into a foreign key column.</p>\n<pre><code>development: {\n  client: 'sqlite3',\n  useNullAsDefault: true,\n  connection: {\n    filename: './data/database.db3',\n  },\n  // needed when using foreign keys\n  pool: {\n    afterCreate: (conn, done) => {\n      // runs after a connection is made to the sqlite engine\n      conn.run('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON', done); // turn on FK enforcement\n    },\n  },\n},\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Migrations</h3>\n<p>Let's look at how we might track our <code>farms</code> and <code>ranchers</code> using Knex. In our migration file's <code>up</code> function, we would want to create two tables:</p>\n<pre><code>exports.up = function(knex, Promise) {\n  return knex.schema\n    .createTable('farms', tbl => {\n      tbl.increments();\n      tbl.string('farm_name', 128)\n        .notNullable();\n    })\n    // we can chain together createTable\n    .createTable('ranchers', tbl => {\n      tbl.increments();\n      tbl.string('rancher_name', 128);\n      tbl.integer('farm_id')\n        // forces integer to be positive\n        .unsigned()\n        .notNullable()\n        .references('id')\n        // this table must exist already\n        .inTable('farms')\n    })\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the foreign key can only be created <em>after</em> the reference table.</p>\n<p>In the down function, the opposite is true. We always want to drop a table with a foreign key <em>before</em> dropping the table it references.</p>\n<pre><code>exports.down = function(knex, Promise) {\n  // drop in the opposite order\n  return knex.schema\n    .dropTableIfExists('ranchers')\n    .dropTableIfExists('farms')\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the case of a many-to-many relationship, the syntax for creating an intermediary table is identical, except for one additional piece. We need a way to make sure our combination of foreign keys is unique.</p>\n<pre><code>.createTable('farm_animals', tbl => {\n  tbl.integer('farm_id')\n    .unsigned()\n    .notNullable()\n    .references('id')\n    // this table must exist already\n    .inTable('farms')\n  tbl.integer('animal_id')\n    .unsigned()\n    .notNullable()\n    .references('id')\n    // this table must exist already\n    .inTable('animals')\n\n// the combination of the two keys becomes our primary key\n  // will enforce unique combinations of ids\n  tbl.primary(['farm_id', 'animal_id']);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Seeds</h3>\n<p>Order is also a concern when seeding. We want to create seeds in the <strong>same</strong> order we created our tables. In other words, don't create a seed with a foreign key, until that reference record exists.</p>\n<p>In our example, make sure to write the <code>01-farms</code> seed file and then the <code>02-ranchers</code> seed file.</p>\n<p>However, we run into a problem with truncating our seeds, because we want to truncate <code>02-ranchers</code> <em>before</em> <code>01-farms</code>. A library called <code>knex-cleaner</code> provides an easy solution for us.</p>\n<p>Run <code>knex seed:make 00-cleanup</code> and <code>npm install knex-cleaner</code>. Inside the cleanup seed, use the following code.</p>\n<pre><code>const cleaner = require('knex-cleaner');\n\nexports.seed = function(knex) {\n  return cleaner.clean(knex, {\n    mode: 'truncate', // resets ids\n    ignoreTables: ['knex_migrations', 'knex_migrations_lock'], // don't empty migration tables\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>This removes all tables (excluding the two tables that track migrations) in the correct order before any seed files run.</p>\n<h3>Cascading</h3>\n<p>If a user attempt to delete a record that is referenced by another record (such as attempting to delete <code>Morton Ranch</code> when entries in our <code>ranchers</code> table reference that record), by default, the database will block the action. The same thing can happen when updating a record when a foreign key reference.</p>\n<p>If we want that to override this default, we can delete or update with <strong>cascade</strong>.

As for most of the things in life, you can't have it all, so it is with the data structures. You will generally need to trade some time for space or the other way around.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><em>time</em></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The time complexity for a data structure is in general more diverse than its space complexity.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><em>Several operations</em></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In contrary to algorithms, when you look at the time complexity for data structures you need to express it for several operations that you can do with data structures. It can be adding elements, deleting elements, accessing an element or even searching for an element.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><em>Dependent on data</em></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Something that data structure and algorithms have in common when talking about time complexity is that they are both dealing with data. When you deal with data you become dependent on them and as a result the time complexity is also dependent of the data that you received. To solve this problem we talk about 3 different time complexity.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><span id=\"bc8d\"><strong>The best-case complexity: when the data looks the best</strong></span></li>\n<li><span id=\"8b06\"><strong>The worst-case complexity: when the data looks the worst</strong></span></li>\n<li><span id=\"881c\"><strong>The average-case complexity: when the data looks average</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Big O notation</h3>\n<p>The complexity is usually expressed with the Big O notation.

To understand more, I'll explain what private fields are, a couple of models for thinking about them, and explain why our implementation diverges from the specification language.The post Implementing Private Fields for JavaScript appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.\n\nPosted Tuesday, June 8, 2021 by Matthew Gaudet\n\nLooking fine with Firefox 89\n\nFirefox 89 has smartened up and brings with it a slimmed-down, slightly more minimalist interface.badFolder Along with this new look, we get some great styling features including a force-colours feature for media queries and better control over how fonts are displayed. The long-awaited top-level await keyword for JavaScript modules is now enabled, as well as the PerformanceEventTiming interface, which is another addition to the performance suite of APIs: 89 really has been working out!The post Looking fine with Firefox 89 appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog.\n\nbadFolder\n\nPosted Tuesday, June 1, 2021 by Chris Mills\n\nbadFolder\n\nImproving Firefox stability on Linux\n\nRoughly a year ago at Mozilla we started an effort to improve Firefox stability on Linux.
