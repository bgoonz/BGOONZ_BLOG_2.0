"""
A description of a set of changes to a file tree to be made as part of
a git commit, modeled as zero or more file `additions` and zero or more
file `deletions`.

Both fields are optional; omitting both will produce a commit with no
file changes.

`deletions` and `additions` describe changes to files identified
by their path in the git tree using unix-style path separators, i.e.
`/`.  The root of a git tree is an empty string, so paths are not
slash-prefixed.

`path` values must be unique across all `additions` and `deletions`
provided.  Any duplication will result in a validation error.

### Encoding

File contents must be provided in full for each `FileAddition`.

The `contents` of a `FileAddition` must be encoded using RFC 4648
compliant base64, i.e. correct padding is required and no characters
outside the standard alphabet may be used.  Invalid base64
encoding will be rejected with a validation error.

The encoded contents may be binary.

For text files, no assumptions are made about the character encoding of
the file contents (after base64 decoding).  No charset transcoding or
line-ending normalization will be performed; it is the client's
responsibility to manage the character encoding of files they provide.
However, for maximum compatibility we recommend using UTF-8 encoding
and ensuring that all files in a repository use a consistent
line-ending convention (`\n` or `\r\n`), and that all files end
with a newline.

### Modeling file changes

Each of the the five types of conceptual changes that can be made in a
git commit can be described using the `FileChanges` type as follows:

1. New file addition: create file `hello world\n` at path `docs/README.txt`:

       {
         "additions" [
           {
             "path": "docs/README.txt",
             "contents": base64encode("hello world\n")
           }
         ]
       }

2. Existing file modification: change existing `docs/README.txt` to have new
   content `new content here\n`:

       {
         "additions" [
           {
             "path": "docs/README.txt",
             "contents": base64encode("new content here\n")
           }
         ]
       }

3. Existing file deletion: remove existing file `docs/README.txt`.
   Note that the path is required to exist -- specifying a
   path that does not exist on the given branch will abort the
   commit and return an error.

       {
         "deletions" [
           {
             "path": "docs/README.txt"
           }
         ]
       }


4. File rename with no changes: rename `docs/README.txt` with
   previous content `hello world\n` to the same content at
   `newdocs/README.txt`:

       {
         "deletions" [
           {
             "path": "docs/README.txt",
           }
         ],
         "additions" [
           {
             "path": "newdocs/README.txt",
             "contents": base64encode("hello world\n")
           }
         ]
       }


5. File rename with changes: rename `docs/README.txt` with
   previous content `hello world\n` to a file at path
   `newdocs/README.txt` with content `new contents\n`:

       {
         "deletions" [
           {
             "path": "docs/README.txt",
           }
         ],
         "additions" [
           {
             "path": "newdocs/README.txt",

  Appends a commit to the given branch as the authenticated user.
  
  This mutation creates a commit whose parent is the HEAD of the provided
  branch and also updates that branch to point to the new commit.
  It can be thought of as similar to `git commit`.
  
  ### Locating a Branch
  
  Commits are appended to a `branch` of type `Ref`.
  This must refer to a git branch (i.e.  the fully qualified path must
  begin with `refs/heads/`, although including this prefix is optional.
  
  Callers may specify the `branch` to commit to either by its global node
  ID or by passing both of `repositoryNameWithOwner` and `refName`.  For
  more details see the documentation for `CommittableBranch`.
  
  ### Describing Changes
  
  `fileChanges` are specified as a `FilesChanges` object describing
  `FileAdditions` and `FileDeletions`.
  
  Please see the documentation for `FileChanges` for more information on
  how to use this argument to describe any set of file changes.
  
  ### Authorship
  
  Similar to the web commit interface, this mutation does not support
  specifying the author or committer of the commit and will not add
  support for this in the future.
  
  A commit created by a successful execution of this mutation will be
  authored by the owner of the credential which authenticates the API
  request.  The committer will be identical to that of commits authored
  using the web interface.
  
  If you need full control over author and committer information, please
  use the Git Database REST API instead.
  
  ### Commit Signing
  
  Commits made using this mutation are automatically signed by GitHub if
  supported and will be marked as verified in the user interface.

  """
  A hex-encoded key that will be used to sign all webhooks sent from this subscription.
  
  You can use the signature to validate that the subscription was sent from OneGraph.
  
  The signature will be sent in the `X-OneGraph-Signature` header of the webhook. The header will contain two parts, a signature and a timestamp (in seconds since the epoch), in the following format:
  
  ```
  X-OneGraph-Signature: t=1582852002,hmac_sha256=7d797ecd431e1a98aaba2f387f2c43241a13c1f093fd9d7e661758963744549a
  ```
  
  To verify the signature:
  1. Extract the timestamp (1582852002 above)
  2. Extract the signature (7d797ecd431e1a98aaba2f387f2c43241a13c1f093fd9d7e661758963744549a above)
  3. Concatenate the timestamp and the request body, separeted by a period (e.g. `t + '.' + requestBody`)
  4. Compute the hmac_sha256 hash of (3)
  5. Compare the hash with the provided signature using a constant-time comparison function (e.g. crypto.timingSafeEqual in Node)
  6. Reject the request if the hash you computed does not match the provided signature or if the timestamp is too far in the past (typically, 5 minutes)
  
  Example for validating the body in Node.js:
  
  ```js
  const SECRET = 'your hmacSha256Key';
  const signature = res.get('X-OneGraph-Signature');
  if (!signature) {
    throw new Error('Missing signature');
  }
  
  const sig = {};
  for (const pair of signature.split(',')) {
    const [k, v] = pair.split('=');
    sig[k] = v;
  }
  
  if (!sig.t || !sig.hmac_sha256) {
    throw new Error('Invalid signature header');
  }
  
  const hash = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', SECRET)
    .update(sig.t)
    .update('.')
    .update(res.body)
    .digest('hex');
  
  if (
    !crypto.timingSafeEqual(
      Buffer.from(hash, 'hex'),
      Buffer.from(sig.hmac_sha256, 'hex'),
    )
  ) {
    throw new Error('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  if (parseInt(sig.t, 10) < Date.now() / 1000 - 300 /* 5 minutes */) {
    throw new Error('Request is too old');
  }
  
  // Signature is valid
  ```
  
  Examples for creating the key:
  
  Cli:
  ```cli
  $ openssl rand -hex 32
  ```
  
  Node:
  ```js
  require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
  ```

  ```ruby
  ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(32)'

For example if the thumbnail width is 100, the height is 100, and the video's aspect ratio is 16:9, the delivered image will be 100x56 (16:9).
    
                                         stretch: The thumbnail will exactly fill the requested width and height, even if it distorts the image. Requires both width and height to be set.

                                         crop: The video image will be scaled up or down until it fills the requested width and height box. Pixels then outside of the box will be cropped off. The crop is always centered on the image. Requires both width and height to be set.
    
                                         smartcrop: An algorithm will attempt to find an area of interest in the image and center it within the crop, while fitting the requested width and height. Requires both width and height to be set.
    
                                         pad: Similar to preserve but Mux will "letterbox" or "pillarbox" (add black padding to) the image to make it fit the requested width and height exactly. This is less efficient than preserve but allows for maintaining the aspect ratio while always getting thumbnails of the same size. Requires both width and height to be set.
